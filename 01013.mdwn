Title: 1.13. Passwordless logins with SSH
If you routinely need to login to several machines, as I do, you will find this tip useful to automate the process. Thanks to Robot101 again!
 ssh-keygen -t dsa
In the previous version of my tip, I did not set a passphrase. Robot101 notes this is generally unwise and that it is better to put a passphrase on, and use ssh-agent. I believe him.
 hendry@praze:~$ ssh-keygen -p
 Enter file in which the key is (/home/hendry/.ssh/id_rsa):  /home/hendry/.ssh/id_dsa
 Key has comment '/home/hendry/.ssh/id_dsa'
 Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
 Enter same passphrase again:
 Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.
In debian, ssh-agent should be already running when you run an X session.
 eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add prompts your for the passphrase which it will remember for the session.
 hendry@praze:~$ ssh-add
 Enter passphrase for /home/hendry/.ssh/id_dsa:
 Identity added: /home/hendry/.ssh/id_dsa (/home/hendry/.ssh/id_dsa)
Finally the command to copy your id to your various shells, such as mine at dabase.com could well be yourmachine.co.uk!
 ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_dsa.pub dabase.com
So now for example, if you want to login automagically and run a process use:
 ssh dabase.com -t theprocessyouwanttorun
Another nifty switch is the -v switch for verbose output ssh (thats fun).
