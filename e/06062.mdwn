[[meta title="Parsing HTML with REs"]]
My repo has better stuff:
	12:18 < hendry> Could anyone shed some light on a regex problem I have here? http://rafb.net/paste/results/U1015016.html
	12:22 < deltab> hendry: it doesn't work for all the arpagraphs
	12:22 < deltab> ^paragraphs
	12:22 < deltab> only those on one line
	12:25 < deltab> hendry: you need the s option to make . match newlines, as The-Fixer mentions
	12:28 < deltab> hendry: or you can pass the flag to re.search:  re.search('<body>(.*?)</body>', re.S)
	12:28 < deltab> er, with the input too
	12:28 < hendry> thanks, I was trying to figure out this 's' meaning
	12:31 < deltab> it makes . match any character including newlines
	12:31 < deltab> also called re.DOTALL
	12:36 < The-Fixer> you can ignore case also: re.search("(?si)<body>(.*?)</body>", '<BODY>ab\ncd\nef</body>').group(1) #==> 'ab\ncd\nef'
	12:47 < moshez> don't do stupid crap
	12:47 < moshez> like, say, parsing HTML with REs
Update:
	10:35 <Pythy> re.search("(?si)<body>([^>]*)</body>", '<BoDy>ab\ncd\nef</bOdY>').group(1) #==> 'ab\ncd\nef'  # for the case where no `>' will appear between
              the <tags>.
	10:38 <Pythy> (If a `<' might appear, a more involved rex could be used.  Handling nesting delimiters is trickier still, as additional code is needed to
              track the depth.  But, as was noted, for a robust solution, a parser is the way to go.)
