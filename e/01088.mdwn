Title: 1.88. dhclient requesting without physical connection
apt-cache show ifplugd
 20:44 < hendry> Is it a bug if dhclient does requests when there is no physical connection ?
 20:44 < Tv> dhclient is too stupid to understand anything else
 20:45 < Tv> use ifplugd to down the interface when it's not connected
