[[meta title="Recording console sessions"]]

# Video

Coolest way is to use the package
[recordmydesktop](http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/recordmydesktop.html) and
upload the video to YouTube or something!

Since my desktop is quite large, you might instead record a window:

	recordmydesktop --follow-mouse -width 256 -height 256

# Text

Want to show someone your work? Try `script`. It annoyingly has all your errors
and frantic backspaces, however I at least find it beneficial.

	script mywork

and ctrl-d or exit stops it recording.

History is another command I run very often, try it.

You can also hardcopy and log sessions with `screen`.
