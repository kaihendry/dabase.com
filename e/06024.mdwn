[[!meta title="Parsing XML for the text/cdata between a particular start/end tag"]]
Here is a code snippet whereby, it would load up the file object into memory, and get the text between a tag. For example a tag such as:

	<school>University of Helsinki</school>
contained in a example file /tmp/myinfo.xml
I would now run make use of the snippet like:

	file_object = open('/tmp/myinfo.xml')

	print parse(file_object, 'school')

	file_object.close()
The snippet:

	from xml.dom import minidom

	def parse(infile, tag):
        output = ''
        xmldoc = minidom.parse(infile)
        grab = xmldoc.getElementsByTagName(tag)
        for data in grab:
                if _debug: print data.toxml()
                childNodes = data.childNodes
                for node in childNodes:
                        output += node.data
        return output + '\n'
Notice I iterated through "grab", as in XML the earlier piece of xml could have be written like:

	<school>

	University
                of

	Helsinki
                             </school>
