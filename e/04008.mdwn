[[meta title="Unicode UTF-8"]]
Most Apache webservers are configured to negotiate content-type as latin-1.
Your perfectly formed XHTML with UTF-8 will get a error like:

	Character Encoding mismatch!

	The character encoding specified in the HTTP header (iso-8859-1) is different from the value in the XML declaration (utf-8).
from http://validator.w3.org/
As a user, you can fix this by adding:

	AddType text/html;charset=UTF-8 html
to your .htaccess file.
Here is an example of an XHTML 1.1 strict head:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

	<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-gb">
   <head>
     <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" name="Content-Type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8"/>
   </head>
