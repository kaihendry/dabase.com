[[!meta title="Cloning a Debian machine"]]
On the machine you want to clone:

	dpkg --get-selections > selections.txt
On the destination machine:

	dpkg --set-selections < selections.txt

	aptitude
Some rsync commands to follow:

	debian:~# rsync -essh -rtpvz / root@192.168.0.141:/
ARGH! NOOOO. Does not work. Tries to do DUMB things like copy /proc and ./mnt

	debian:~# rsync -essh -rtpvz /etc root@192.168.0.141:/etc
Doesn't work for some reason...
