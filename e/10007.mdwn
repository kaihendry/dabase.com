Title: 10.7. Biblography tips
Usually your school or research organization gives you a .bst file to work with. e.g. tktl.bst
This has the styles you need to work with in some sort of functional bibtex language.
I was looking for something to give attribution or cite material like W3C specs on the web. THANKFULLY there was something in tktl.bst that does it, as the latex defaults I don't think cut it.
In my bst my favourite is @www-inproceedings.
You could write a bst yourself, but I am sure that is probably not a good idea.
When compiling your tex look closely for warnings. Sort them out.
