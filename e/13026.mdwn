[[!meta title="Parsing a comma seperated file with shell"]]

Make sure you [read the file line by line correctly](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001) using a while read construct.

	while read -r line
	do
		IFS=","
		set -- $line
		echo $4 >> $1.mdwn
		echo "$line"
	done < "m4.2_testplan.csv"

Use `set` to parse the CSV. It doesn't do a perfect job, but it's usually ok.


In the above example I'm splitting a test description from column 4 into a file
named after the id from column 1.
