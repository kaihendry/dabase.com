	Seagate Freeagent Desktop 500GB External Hard drive 7200RPM 8MB USB2.0

For 69GBP from Amazon.co.uk. So that's about 15 pence for Gigabyte. Quite good value!

Plug it in:

	scsi 3:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Seagate  FreeAgentDesktop 100F PQ: 0 ANSI: 4
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] 976773168 512-byte hardware sectors (500108 MB)
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 1c 00 00 00
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] 976773168 512-byte hardware sectors (500108 MB)
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 1c 00 00 00
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through
	 sdb: sdb1
	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk

In my case it's sdb. You need to be super careful and USE THE RIGHT DISK!

Prime the disk:

	x61:~% sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb
	  Device /dev/sdb not found (or ignored by filtering).
	x61:~% sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
	  Physical volume "/dev/sdb1" successfully created

Should show up now:

	x61:~% sudo pvscan
	  PV /dev/sda5   VG x61   lvm2 [111.55 GB / 4.00 MB free]
	  PV /dev/sdb1            lvm2 [465.76 GB]
	  Total: 2 [577.31 GB] / in use: 1 [111.55 GB] / in no VG: 1 [465.76 GB]

Now we need a Volume Group:

	x61:~% sudo vgcreate seagate /dev/sdb1
	  Volume group "seagate" successfully created
	x61:~% sudo vgscan
	  Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...
	  Found volume group "seagate" using metadata type lvm2
	  Found volume group "x61" using metadata type lvm2

Ok, lets create the Logical Volume:

	x61:~% sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -next3 seagate
	  Logical volume "ext3" created
	x61:~% sudo lvscan
	  ACTIVE            '/dev/seagate/ext3' [465.76 GB] inherit
	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/root' [16.68 GB] inherit
	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/swap_1' [2.59 GB] inherit
	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/home' [80.00 GB] inherit
	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/crypt' [12.27 GB] inherit

Ok, now lets create an ext3 partition on there:

	x61:~% sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/seagate/ext3
	mke2fs 1.40.6 (09-Feb-2008)
	Warning: 256-byte inodes not usable on older systems
	Filesystem label=
	OS type: Linux
	Block size=4096 (log=2)
	Fragment size=4096 (log=2)
	30531584 inodes, 122095616 blocks
	6104780 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
	First data block=0

			32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
			4096000, 7962624, 11239424, 20480000, 23887872, 71663616, 78675968,
			102400000

	Writing inode tables: done

	Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

	This filesystem will be automatically checked every 25 mounts or
	180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.

Ok, lets test it out:

	x61:~% sudo mkdir /mnt/sg
	x61:~% sudo mount /dev/seagate/ext3 /mnt/sg
	x61:~% df -h | grep sg
						  459G  199M  435G   1% /mnt/sg
	x61:~% ll /mnt/sg
	total 24K
	drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K 2008-02-28 16:41 ./
	drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4.0K 2008-02-28 16:50 ../
	drwx------ 2 root root  16K 2008-02-28 16:41 lost+found/

SO 500G becomes about 435G....


So putting into my slug, I found I needed to make it ACTIVE by:

	slug:~% sudo lvscan
	  inactive          '/dev/seagate/ext3' [465.76 GB] inherit
	slug:~% sudo lvchange -a y /dev/seagate/ext3
	slug:~% sudo lvscan
	  ACTIVE            '/dev/seagate/ext3' [465.76 GB] inherit

Ok lets share this guy:

	slug:~% egrep seagate /etc/exports
	/media/seagate 192.168.1.*(insecure,rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,nohide)
	slug:~% egrep seagate /etc/fstab
	/dev/seagate/ext3 /media/seagate auto   rw,user,auto  0       0

Problems, bugs, I wish this didn't happen:

	sd 1:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Current: sense key=0x2
		ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x2
	end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 12807
	Buffer I/O error on device dm-0, logical block 1545
	lost page write due to I/O error on dm-0
	sd 1:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Current: sense key=0x2
		ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x2
	end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 12807
	Buffer I/O error on device dm-0, logical block 1545
	lost page write due to I/O error on dm-0
	sd 1:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Current: sense key=0x2

I have noticed when initially mounting and using the device, you can see these
scary messages. The OS can decide to remount the device as readonly and then
you'll know things are going wrong. To rectifiy the situation I simply unmount
and mount the disk again and watch the logs with `tail -f /var/log/messages`.
