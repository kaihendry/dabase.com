[[meta title="(kernel module) keeps on loading at boot time and I don't know how to remove it..."]]
The tool you should use to remove and add modules is:
 modconf
What it does, is simply add a line to:
 /etc/modules
But sometimes modconf does not work. Try re-run:
 update-modules
after editing.
 tail -n50 /var/log/messages
And search for it's entry in /etc/modules /etc/modutils. Try:
 egrep modulename /etc/modutils/*
Once you located the file, comment the line out.
My example:
 hendry@bilbo:~$ egrep bttv /etc/modutils/*
 /etc/modutils/actions:post-install bttv insmod tuner
 /etc/modutils/actions:post-remove bttv rmmod tuner
 /etc/modutils/aliases:alias char-major-81       bttv
