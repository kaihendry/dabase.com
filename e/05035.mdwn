[[meta title="RAID sucks"]]
From http://www.gllug.org.uk/index.php?/archives/35-Mailing-Lists-are-broken.html
	As the server uses hardware RAID we cannot simply swap the disks into a different box and replacing the PSU etc is likely to take about a week.
From experience in a datacentre, RAID mounts fail. Esp. DELL.
RAID batteries fail.
A lot of RAID hardware is proprietary and buggy.
Software RAID is often worse.
Rebuilding configurations with broken RAID setups can be really hard.
