# Mailing list

Pros:

* Minuted
* Detailed
* Scales

Cons:

* Difficult to grasp thread if using a poor client (common)
* Difficult for some people to write and respond to emails (common with the older generation and decision makers)
* Threads can just carry on and on ...

# Face to Face meetings

Pros:

* High bandwidth
* Often highly effective
* Important for social connections
* Often needs careful planning and agenda in order not to waste any time

Cons:

* Needs to be minuted
* Very expensive in time and money
* Important people can be missing
* Teleconference bridges can sink a F2F meeting's effectiveness

# Teleconferences

Pros:

* Can make quick decisions
* Can mention sensitive items 'off record' to the group
* Only reasonable backup for attending some F2F meetings, when lack of IRC back channel

Cons:

* Decisions can be made too hastily
* Does not scale (annoying delays and voice quality)

# IRC

Pros:

* Always on
* Often quick to get a response
* Scales

Cons:

* Only geeks use the medium :)
