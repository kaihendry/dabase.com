[[!meta title="Comparing modes of working communication"]]

# Mailing list

Pros:

* Minuted
* Detailed
* Scales (if you are following)

Cons:

* Difficult to grasp thread if using a poor client (common)
* Difficult for some people to write and respond to emails (common with the older generation and decision makers)
* Threads can just carry on and on ...

# Face to Face (F2F) meetings

Pros:

* High bandwidth communication
* Often highly effective
* Important for deeper **social** connections
* Natural

Cons:

* Often needs careful planning and agenda in order not to waste any time
* Often needs excellent chairing to avoid 'rat holing'
* Needs to be minuted
* Very expensive in time and money
* Important people can be missing (may join with Teleconference)
* Teleconference bridges can sink a F2F meeting's effectiveness (see pros listed above)

# Video conferences

* [Halo](http://www.hp.com/halo/) - recommended
* [Polycom](http://www.polycom.com/usa/en/products/telepresence_video/video_conference_systems/index.html)

Pros:

* Requires a very good Internet connection
* Expensive
* Convenient

Cons:

* People you need to talk to often do not have compatible equipment
* Some videoconferencing solutions are incredibly awkward
* Does not scale
* Complex

# Teleconferences

Pros:

* Can make quick decisions
* Can mention sensitive items 'off record' to the group (quite hard WRT mailing list)
* Only reasonable backup for attending some F2F meetings, when lack of IRC back channel
* Can be quite good quality and cheap with Skype

Cons:

* Decisions can be made too hastily
* Does not scale (annoying delays)
* Sound quality issues
* "I take silence as agreement"
* Talking out of turn is awkward
* Can be expensive if no local dial-ins available
* No formal IP bridge for Skype for example
* Quite hard to find a time to suit everybody

# IRC - Inter Relay Chat

Pros:

* Always on
* Often quick to get a response
* Scales
* Can export minutes to Web easily
* Helps to track F2F communication (non-native English speakers)

Cons:

* Only geeks use the medium :)
* It is tricky to setup properly
* Takes some experience to be used to the medium
* Takes even more time to understand minute syntax and robot commands
