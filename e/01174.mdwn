[[!meta title="Tunnelling ssh through https"]]

You need `sudo apt-get install corkscrew` on the client machine.

You need to figure out the proxy address if your corporate environment is dumb
enough to use a non-transparent proxy, in my case it's 145.230.25.1.

On your host, in my case webconverger.org, hosted with
[Bitfolk](http://bitfolk.com), you need to specify the HTTPS port 443 in the
configuration and reload the [sshd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH) daemon.

	grep "Port 443" /etc/ssh/sshd_config


Now with a `~/.ssh/config` setup like so:

	ProxyCommand /usr/bin/corkscrew 145.230.25.1 8080 %h %p
	host webc
		HostName webconverger.org
		Port 443

In my case I `ssh webc` to freedom.
