Title: 1.51. Check out some multimedia
Well, tonight I was wondering how to play a .wav file from the command line.

 sox chat1.wav -t ossdsp -w -s /dev/dsp

Then part on #debian-fi pointed me out:

Which from the manpage:

 run-mailcap, see, edit, compose, print - execute programs via entries in the mailcap file
Very cool...
