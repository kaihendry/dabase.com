[[meta title="Outputting VIM buffer as HTML"]]

This tip applies for escaping those pesky &lt;&gt; angled brackets.

TOhtml is not a built in, it's a plugin:

	:let html_use_css = 1
	:TOhtml

And of course the help in vim tells you much more:

	:help TOhtml


Thanks to #vim on Freenode for the tip.
