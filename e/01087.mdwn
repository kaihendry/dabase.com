[[!meta title="SMTP via SSH"]]

SMTP can be blocked at ISPs to prevent spammers.

Use a shell script with this [[ssh access to a remote machine|e/01013]].

	$ cat /usr/sbin/sendmail
	#!/bin/sh
	ssh sg.webconverger.com /usr/sbin/sendmail "$@"

This is a less suckier solution than running msmtp or esmtp, since you rely on
your ssh credentials, not some saved password on your filesystem.

You can configure [mutt MUA](http://www.mutt.org/) to use a specific sendmail binary like so:

	$ egrep sendmail .muttrc
	set sendmail = "/home/hendry/sg-sendmail"
