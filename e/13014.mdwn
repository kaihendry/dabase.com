Title: 13.14. Getting port numbers out of /etc/service
There is usually a couple of ways:
 15:14 < hendry> gnychis: tail /etc/services | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F / '{print $1}'
 15:18 < m4n> gnychis: while read line; do line="${line%/*}"; echo "${line##* }"; done < yourfile
Though the second one is a bashism.
