	" ".join(s.split())
Update:

	10:39 <Pythy>    map(lambda s : re.sub('\s+',' ',s), crex.match(s).groups())

	10:39 <Pythy> was for a more complex case than simply squeezing-down spans of whitespace.

	10:40 <Pythy> s = '  \t  AAA   \r\n  BBB  ';  s =  re.sub('\s+',' ',s.strip());   s #==> 'AAA BBB'

	10:41 <Pythy> is all you need to do what s = ' '.join(s.split()) does.

	10:42 <Pythy> the additional map() and .match() was to only apply this to specific extracts.
