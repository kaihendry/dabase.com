[[meta title="Joining a list of strings, or ints"]]
I think the join syntax is slightly strange:
 >>> list = ['cow','dog','cat']
 >>> print list.join()
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
 AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'join'
 >>> print join.list()
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
 NameError: name 'join' is not defined
 >>> print ''.join.list
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
 AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute  'list'
 >>> print ''.join(list)
 cowdogcat
 >>> print ' '.join(list)
 cow dog cat
 >>>
Ok if you try join a list of ints:
 >>> ' '.join([12,34,56,78])
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
 TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found
It will not work. What you need is to convert each int into a str. Nasty, I know :
 >>> ' '.join(map(str,([12,34,56,78])))
 '12 34 56 78'
Thanks to #python, in partic. dash
