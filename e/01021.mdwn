[[meta title="Use 'sudo', not 'su'"]]
On many previous occassions, I would show people how to upgrade their debians boxes. First I would su to root. This is not good practice. Use sudo instead, and use your user password.
Example:
 sudo dselect update
Update package listings, and then upgrade :)
 sudo apt-get -u dist-upgrade
