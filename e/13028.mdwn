[[!meta title="Do not use GNU find when recursion is not needed"]]

Consider:

	find . -name author-signature.xml -o -name 'signature*.xml'

It correctly returns:

	./author-signature.xml
	./signature1.xml

Oh, but I don't what the './' prefix. Lets add `-printf "%P\n"`, quickly check and sign-off.

Then later you get a report an incredulous report that author signatures aren't
being checked. WTF?

The -printf only applies when the second -name is successful, not when the first is.

The solution? Add some fecking brackets:

	find . \( -name author-signature.xml -o -name 'signature*.xml' \) -printf "%P\n"

This is ugly, compare with the way I **should** have been doing it in the first place:

	for i in author-signature.xml signature*.xml; do echo $i; done

Morale of the story, do **not** use GNU find. It's against the UNIX philosophy
and it's an abomination of a command to use.

Though do **not** use `ls` for finding stuff either.
