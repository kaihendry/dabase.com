[[!meta title="Running Firefox in a systemd-nspawn container"]]

Assuming you installed firefox in a container `~/containers/firefox`. On first
run on got **Segmentation fault**s until I got [st](http://st.suckless.org/)
working. I suspect it's something to do with fonts!

# PID 1

You can run Firefox as PID 1 with an invocation like:

	sudo systemd-nspawn --setenv=DISPLAY=:0 \
				   --setenv=XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority \
				   --bind-ro=$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority \
				   --bind=/tmp/.X11-unix \
				   -D ~/containers/firefox \
				   firefox

However, [Lennart warns](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-August/034006.html) that Firefox shouldn't be PID 1.

# Running in a booted and isolated network interface

To isolate a container to its own networking interface you need to create a
virtual Ethernet link ("veth") between host and container aka run with **-n**
or **--network-veth**. However as I note in a [systemd-devel mailing list
message](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-August/034013.html),
you need to now **boot** the container in order to setup networking.

	sudo systemd-nspawn --bind-ro=$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority \
				   --bind=/tmp/.X11-unix \
				   -D ~/containers/firefox \
				   --network-veth -b

Now with the style of container instatation you need to either start
**systemd-networkd** [manually](http://s.natalian.org/2015-08-25/bbcnews.png)
or have enabled it beforehand.

I use a container networking configuration like so
[/etc/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network](http://s.natalian.org/2015-08-26/80-container-host0.network).

Now run Firefox as [Lennart suggests](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-August/034014.html) with:

	sudo systemd-run -M firefox --setenv=DISPLAY=:0 firefox

To see it's network activity, assuming your container is called "firefox" like mine:

	grep firefox /proc/net/dev
	ve-firefox:  407205    2396    0    0    0     0          0         0  3732997    2814    0    0    0     0       0          0

So ~4 megabytes for a non-interactive Desktop session for BBC news. Notice from
the point of view of the host, the data was transmitted - to the container!

That's why `/proc/net/dev`'s **Receive** and **Transmit** might be flipped around.
