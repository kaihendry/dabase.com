[[!meta title="btrfs disk space"]]


I heard about `df` mis-reporting with btrfs and I assumed it was that `df` reports less than what was actually available.

No. `df` is actually reporting MORE than what's available!


	core@dc ~ $ df -h
	Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
	devtmpfs        487M     0  487M   0% /dev
	tmpfs           499M     0  499M   0% /dev/shm
	tmpfs           499M  332K  499M   1% /run
	tmpfs           499M     0  499M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
	/dev/vda9        28G   23G  4.2G  85% /
	/dev/vda3       985M  346M  588M  38% /usr
	tmpfs           499M     0  499M   0% /tmp
	tmpfs           499M     0  499M   0% /media
	/dev/vda6       108M   56K   99M   1% /usr/share/oem
	core@dc ~ $ sudo btrfs fi df /s fs fi df /
	Data, single: total=21.21GiB, used=19.30GiB
	System, DUP: total=8.00MiB, used=16.00KiB
	System, single: total=4.00MiB, used=0.00B
	Metadata, DUP: total=2.10GiB, used=1.21GiB
	Metadata, single: total=8.00MiB, used=0.00B
	GlobalReserve, single: total=416.00MiB, used=0.00B


So `df` reports 4.2G free on root, but actually I have 21.21-19.30=1.91GB free according to btrfs tooling! YIKES!
