[[meta title="Inserting a Unicode character in VIM"]]

Ok, lets first lookup the character we want with [unicode](http://packages.qa.debian.org/u/unicode.html):

	x61:~% unicode -r peace
	U+262E PEACE SYMBOL
	UTF-8: e2 98 ae  UTF-16BE: 262e  Decimal: &#9774;
	☮
	Category: So (Symbol, Other)
	Bidi: ON (Other Neutrals)

	U+4DCA HEXAGRAM FOR PEACE
	UTF-8: e4 b7 8a  UTF-16BE: 4dca  Decimal: &#19914;
	䷊
	Category: So (Symbol, Other)
	Bidi: ON (Other Neutrals)

The important element is the U+262E part, which is the Unicode **codepoint**.

Now into insert the PEACE SYMBOL, in INSERT MODE type:

	[Ctrl]+[v], [u], [2], [6], [2], [E]

If you can't see the inserted character, try `gvim`. Also try place the cursor over the character an use `ga` shortcut to examine the character underneath the cursor.

`ga` might report something like:

	<?> 9774, Hex 262e, Octal 23056

Understand the **Hexadecimal** is the key to the codepoint.
