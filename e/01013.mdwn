[[!meta title="Passwordless logins with SSH"]]

If you routinely need to login to several machines, as I do, you will find this tip useful to automate the process. Thanks to Robot101 again!

    ssh-keygen

In the previous version of my tip, I did not set a passphrase. Robot101 notes this is generally unwise and that it is better to put a passphrase on, and use ssh-agent. I believe him.

    ssh-keygen
    ssh-copy-id dabase.com
    ssh dabase.com -t theprocessyouwanttorun

Another nifty switch is the -v switch for verbose output ssh (thats fun).

[DSA 1571-1](http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html) means that if you are Debian and have a key in use earlier than 13 May 2008. You must **regenerate**.
