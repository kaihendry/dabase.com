[[meta title="Escaping and quoting best practices for PHP"]]

[PHP best practices](http://talks.php.net/show/php-best-practices/26)

	21:28 <@Xiven> the philosophy is that you don't want to end up doing silly things like storing it html-escaped in a database.  not everything is output as html either
	21:29 <@Xiven> you SQL escape just before you enter into a database, you HTML escape just before you output html, you URL encode just before you use it in a URL
	21:29 <@Xiven> you can never be sure that later on, that variable isn't going to be used in some other way
	21:30 <@Xiven> and when you start doing object-oriented stuff, your object should never expect to be fed escaped data
	21:30 <@Xiven> this is why PHP's "magic quotes" are a bad idea
	21:30 <@Xiven> for a simple small app it seems nice

When you output input, use **htmlspecialchars**. Or [htmlentities](http://talks.php.net/show/php-best-practices/23).

When you put stuff in a database. Quote it! Avoid [SQL injection](http://talks.php.net/show/php-best-practices/21).
