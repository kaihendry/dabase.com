[[meta title="Pinning"]]
[1] You should really add testing to your /etc/apt/sources.list and give it
a default 'pin' of -1 so that it would never install from it -- unless you
ask for it explicitly.  Then say 'apt-get -t testing install r-base' and it
will install r-base from testing, i.e. 1.8.1, with just its required
libraries, leaving the rest of your system alone. As libraries are properly
versioned, this is generally safe, and a trick that has been used by many,
many users.
