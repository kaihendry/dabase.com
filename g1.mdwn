# Do not write Dalvik Android applications

First I implore you not to write an [Android Application](http://code.google.com/android/). i.e. a [Java dalvik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_virtual_machine) .apk.

Most developers require Geolocation and you can easily achieve [Geolocation in
the Android browser](http://geo.webvm.net/). The Web is the future!

## Other reasons not to develop Dalvik applications

* Google's Market has no upgrade mechanism. The Web has easy seamless upgrades
by default. Why choose anything else than giving your users continuous
improvement everyday?
* The Web works on more devices and computers than Dalvik ever will. Why limit your application's audience?
* Want to create bookmarks to your Web application from the homescreen? Use [Gears shortcut](http://code.google.com/apis/gears/samples/hello_world_shortcuts/hello_world_shortcuts.html) mechanism!

# Use cases

Lets consider some use cases I want. :)

## Sharing a snap on Flickr then making a tweet about it.

## Having 100% reception, or rather... being able to tweet whilst not connected

## A friend texts me from her new mobile number. How do I get that number from a SMS into my contact as a secondary number?

# Android supports the @font-face src attribute

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3014049284/" title="Android @font-face src by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/3014049284_34e79db7df_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Android @font-face src" /></a>

My [style sheet](http://dabase.com/local.css) loads the [Andika
font](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Andika).
Try this page in your Android browser!

## What is @font-face ??

It basically means you can dynamically use any font you want.

A big problem or blessing if you like sane type faces, is there is
only a few "Web fonts" that work everywhere.

However new technology exists where you just download them on the fly,
and Android supports this. So designers can rejoice that they can use
type faces they want. Without using horrible techniques like making
bitmap images of headings which can't work on mobiles as they can't
scale.

# G1 Annoyances

1. SMS not being integrated to email. Basically I want to forward SMSes as email. Would be nice to have an email address that fowards to SMS.
* [No G1 on T-mobile's account page](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/3005378966/)
* Phone number in status not updated after number change
* [Android Issue list](http://b.android.com)

Gtalk chats are a great feature. But often I miss the chat and I can't figure
out how the "Recent conversations archive" supposed to work. What's worse is
that sometimes I confuse chat with SMS and SMS does not seem to appear in Chats
pane of Gmail!

# Poor Web integration

You can thankfully add bookmarks to the home screen. Your Web application can
too with the [Gears shortcut
API](http://code.google.com/apis/gears/samples/hello_world_shortcuts/hello_world_shortcuts.html).
What would be better is [widget support](http://wiki.webvm.net/widgets/).

Once opening a bookmark from the homescreen, Android launches a new window in
Android Chrome Web browser. Unfortunately this really sucks as your can only
have 6 windows open at one time. Since default actions open a new window, it's
quite easy to hit this limit annoyingly again and again. The paradox is that
you are somehow allowed to keep many multiple Dalvik applications open in the
background, but not Web applications!!


# T-mobile customer service

The good thing is that you can just email `CustomerServices@t-mobile.co.uk` and
you'll more than likely receive a response. This beats Three.co.uk who
basically refused to answer queries by any medium other that voice. I assume
they do this to ensure they can not be held liable for any misinformation as it
is difficult to record voice.

The bad things are you'll get an autoresponder once sending the mail. And the
follow up will more than likely be an essay with bad news from a customer
service **'droid**.

Update: Lately they demand:

	So that I can answer your query, I'll need to access your account to confirm
	you're the account holder. To do this I need you to confirm your mobile number,
	full name and address including postcode and your password if you have one
	registered to the account.

Even for generic questions! Once I gave my number as the **Phone number** in
**Status** is incorrect. They rung me up instead of replying. I asked them
politely to please email me a response instead. This was resisted heavily and I
still have not heard from T-mobile customer service! PA-THE-TIC T-mobile. Oh I
have received a response now after emailing again:

	I've also checked your other query for you and I'm afraid there?s no work
	around to remove the number from your status menu. However this wont affect
	your phone.

## Things that suck with T-mobile

1. [No conference call](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/3006708296/)
* Call waiting does not seem to work
* Data reception at the University of Surrey SUCKS, even though they advertise on campus! WTF
* [No special treatment for T hotspots](http://static.natalian.org/2008-11-08/tmobile1.txt) -- "Sadly, there are no discounts for this service at present."
* [Your 250+ GBP allowance does not work abroad](http://static.natalian.org/2008-11-08/tmobile2.txt) - no special deals for Germany :(

# The proprietary headphone jack

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3013612244/" title="Touch diamond versus G1 HTC headphones by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/3013612244_9e45bf8a69_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Touch diamond versus G1 HTC headphones" /></a>

HTC use a [proprietary
ExtUSB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtUSB#Proprietary_connectors_and_formats)
interface for audio. You can get a [Stereo Headset Adapter - HTC
exUSB](http://www.clove.co.uk/viewProduct.aspx?product=09D7B5BC-39D9-42F9-BC15-78CD943917F6)
for 8GBP. :/
