For the last year Archlinux has been recommending users to use
[netctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl) to configure their
network interfaces.

Netctl's ethernet-dhcp worked well, but not the wireless interface management
which never made sense to me.

Upstream's Jouke Witteveen is
[sadly](https://github.com/joukewitteveen/netctl/issues/66)
[unhelpful](https://github.com/joukewitteveen/netctl/issues/81) despite my
cries for help.

So on the back of systemd's (>210) **systemd-networkd**, which I [previously blogged about when
configuring my Droplet](http://dabase.com/blog/Systemd_network_on_a_Droplet/),
I now have:

	$ cat /etc/systemd/network/eth0.network
	[Match]
	Name=eth0
	[Network]
	DHCP=yes

Via `journalctl -u systemd-networkd.service -f` this seems to be able to detect
the carrier is on or off **without** ifplugd. Nice!

Unresolved: When eth0 comes up, resolv.conf is at `/run/systemd/network/resolv.conf` oddly, it recommends creating a symlink, but I bring up my wireless a different way using `dhcpcd`.

## Wireless

	sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service

You need to make sure /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf is in
place, as you can see in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/wpa_supplicant@.service`.

However `wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service` alone, doesn't seem to be enough to get
the IP address. So we need a DHCP client, slightly confusingly named
**dhcpcd**.

	sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd@wlan0.service

But then I noticed `/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/10-wpa_supplicant`! So I don't tink you need `wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service`.

## TODO

When network is plugged in (carrier on), disable wireless and use wired.
Currently I manually turn off wifi using my Thinkpad's switch.

Currently [dhcpcd 6.3.1-2 gets
racy](http://s.natalian.org/2014-03-17/1395037018_1364x742.png). This means my
machine doesn't shutdown as `dhcpcd -x` doesn't seem to do the trick. I tried to report the bug <https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/39512>.
