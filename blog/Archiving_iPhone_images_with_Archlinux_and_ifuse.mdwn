Using `sudo ifuse /mnt/iphone/` you can mount your Iphone6 as I do and archive
the contents of **DCIM** your hard drive. Make sure you have _Personal Hotspot_
enabled else it might not work.

	rsync -Part /mnt/iphone/DCIM ~/media/iphone6

However you may find the Photos app has not detected the images have been moved, and it's not recreating the database.

The workaround is to:

	rm /mnt/iphone/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite

And then reboot the iPhone to fix it.
