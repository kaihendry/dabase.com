Using `ifuse` you can mount your Iphone6 as I do and archive the contents of **DCIM** your hard drive.

However you may find the Photos app has not detected the images have been moved, and it's not recreating the database.

The workaround is to

	rm ./PhotoData/Photos.sqlite

And reboot the iPhone to fix it.
