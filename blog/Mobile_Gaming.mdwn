Thanks to the [Hide & Seek festival in London](http://hideandseekfest.co.uk/)
this Sunday, I played two interesting games using a mobile device.

[Playing And I saw](http://hideandseek.andisaw.com/howtoplay/) was about simply
messaging a 6 digit shortcode to a designated telephone number. So it could be
played by old and new phones and didn't require the mobile Web. However if you
did have a "mobile Web enabled phone", you could look up the [status of the
game](http://hideandseek.andisaw.com/) which is as useful as a twitterstream,
i.e. very useful. I enjoyed bumping into people around Southbank and exchanging
shortcodes with other short-coded players and finding coded nearby objects.

[The Go Game](http://thegogame.co.uk/) makes explicit use of the mobile Web to
give challenges to teams and co-ordinate the whole game. It was interesting to
hear the game's organisers give the introductory talks and make special note of
problems concerning Blackberry's browsers. :) Unlike the previous game, you
play in a team and you also can do inter-team challenges. It's a lot of fun and
you should try it!

I've been waiting a long time for a good game on the mobile. And this weekend I
feel like I've finally hit that milestone. Not only have I now played a
worthwhile and enjoyable game using my mobile, I have confirmed that theory
about mobiles being more social and immersive is so very true.
