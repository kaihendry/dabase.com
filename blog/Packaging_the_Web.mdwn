Packaging has interested
[me](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=hendry@iki.fi) for awhile and of
late I prefer the [simple arch
packaging](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dwm-hg/dwm-hg/PKGBUILD) where you
just clone from a [hg URL](http://hg.suckless.org/) that's importantly
browsable from the Web.

Since I work with
[widgets](http://dabase.com/blog/Widgets_are_simple_offline_packages/), I'm
often left thinking about how they compare to "the Debian way" of doing things.

# The kill switch

This seems to be an Operator requirement, since
[Android](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/16/android_kill_switch/) and the
Itunes App store I believe implements one.

On Debian and all other Linux distributions security is largely the
responsibility of the user. That is to
[remove](http://www.debian.org/News/2008/20081023) or **upgrade** the package
in question. It most cases an "evil" or dangerous package is detected by its
maintainer or during the unstable->testing->stable transition by intrepid
users. Further information are given in [security
advisories](http://debian.org/security/#DSAS), which in turn are usually linked
to a wider [CVE identifier](http://cve.mitre.org/).

I personally like the upgrade approach as that's very much in line of how the
Web works. You update your way out of trouble, and that works for all parties.

[Removal](http://ftp-master.debian.org/#removed) (aka the kill switch) is a
very **negative process**.  What happens if a user relies on that particular
"bad" app to get his or her job done? There is [no upgrade
path](http://wiki.debian.org/ftpmaster_Removals) for users.

# Comparing the update process

Updates is a pain point. On Debian for example, they are done rather
inefficiently, as you need to download the entire package even though there
might be a one line of change.

On mobiles, this problem worsens as network capacity is tightly limited and
complex, where [OTA push
updates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming) are favoured.
Furthermore Operators typically demand to test each update before deployment,
making the process rather cumbersome and slow.

I personally think the manual upgrade path with efficient [binary
diffing](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/07/smaller-is-faster-and-safer-too.html)
is the way forward, much like the Web has shown all the other platforms how to
do it.

# And who does the updates ?

If a problem is found on Debian, the [security
team](http://debian.org/security/#contact) or package maintainer assume
responsibility for fixing the problem as **quickly as possible**.

In the widget world, Android & Apple App store world, the emphasis is squarely
on the author to fix the problem or be banned/removed/killed. I would argue
this is bad for users and ecosystem at large.
