This late rant is prompted by [Widget interface spec (Last Call)](http://twitter.com/widgetspecs/status/5799561554).

Widget APIs or rather [Widgets 1.0: The widget
Interface](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/) is largely about exposing what's
defined in the widget [configuration
document](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/Overview.html#configuration-document)
to the Widget developer.

**WHY?** You may rightly ask. The widget developer should know his own name and
email address whilst writing a function to mail him a [bug
report](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/#metadata-attribute-values). I guess
someone has argued that slapping new `Widget.` attributes makes it easier for
library developers. [BONDI](http://bondi.omtp.org/) incidentally rightly (imo),
didn't bother with this mapping.

Another reason WHY pointed out by
[robin](http://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/5825994237) is that the simple
Widget interface exposed by the widget runtime, would implement locale support
and give you the localised interface. I.e. it's doing a bit of work
behind the scenes for the convienance of Widget developers and well...
non-English speakers.

Ok, in an [example](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/Overview.html#configuration-document) Widget configuration file, like `config.xml`, you might find:

	<widget xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets" id="http://bondisdk.limofoundation.org/widget/webcmd" version="0.4.2" viewmodes="fullscreen">

Which maps onto the [Widget interface](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/) as:

	Widget.id = "http://bondisdk.limofoundation.org/widget/webcmd";
	Widget.version = "0.4.2";

Though what about viewmodes? Hmm...

Then:

	<name short="WebC">Web Commander</name>

Maps as:

	Widget.name = "Web Commander";
	Widget.shortName = "WebC";

Ok, the attribute `short` was used as a prefix to `name` which has become capitialised in order to make it easier to distinguish. Ok, fine. However this is there is _an inconsistency_ with:

	<author href="http://bondi.limofoundation.org/" email="sdk@bondisdk.org">LiMo Foundation</author>

Maps to the Widget interface like so:

	Widget.author = "LiMo Foundation";
	Widget.authorEmail = "sdk@bondisdk.org";
	Widget.authorHref = "http://bondi.limofoundation.org/";

Now the author element attributes like `email` and `href` become suffixed to `author`. You see how `shortName, should be **nameShort**?

Other elements can be found on the `config.xml` such as:

	  <feature name="http://bondi.omtp.org/api/ui" required="true"/>
	  <license href="http://bondi.omtp.org/BONDI-LICENSE-2.0/"/>
	  <content src="index.html"/>
	  <feature name="http://bondi.omtp.org/api/appconfig" required="true"/>
	  <feature name="http://bondi.omtp.org/api/filesystem" required="true"/>

However there is no mapping to the [Widget
interface](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/). Who decides what gets mapped
and what doesn't? Wouldn't it be simpler and more consistent to just map
everything?

It does get tricky especially thinking about the possible multiply nested <http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/Overview.html#the-param-element>.

Also some punks might overload the `config.xml` with  _openURL_ which would clash.

I understand some elements like the [feature elements](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/Overview.html#feature) and undefined (proprietary) elements like:

	<access network="false" localfs="false" remote_scripts="false"/>
	<billing required="true"/>

..are perhaps only relevant and used by particular runtimes, though shouldn't there be convention and reasoning for why (and why **not**) certain interfaces are exposed in the [widget interface specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/)?


If the <http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/#the-preferences-attribute> was
mandatory, which I think it should be since many widgets I've come across rely
on **setPreferenceForKey** and **preferenceForKey** conventions, wouldn't it be
sensible to put the interfaces all into this **preference** [Web
storage](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/) mechanism?

Consider read-only keys like:

	Widget.getItem("name")
	Widget.getItem("nameShort")
	Widget.getItem("authorEmail")
	Widget.getItem("licencseHref")

Though perhaps ideally when you did a `Widget.getItem`, you received the JSON
representation of the XML fragment. Though I'm not entirely sure if there is a
standard way to map XML onto JSON. You might as well canonicalise the whole
`config.xml` as a JSON string bound to **Widget.config**. There, simple.  Or
`innerXML` if a JSON translation isn't possible.

Btw the Widget interface as it stands are all readonly except for
[preferences](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/#the-preferences-attribute) and
[openURL](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/#the-openurl-method).

# widthxheight

It's unclear to me if
[width](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/#the-width-attributes) and
[height](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/#the-height-attribute) map to the
`config.xml` or the real actual viewport size. Surely one can defer to
`window.screen.width` and `window.screen.height` instead? I know it says
`screen`, but just imagine it says `viewport`?

# My final proposal Widget interface proposal after thinking about it for two hours


	interface Widget {
		readonly attribute DOMString     config; // innerXML or rather JSON representation of configuration document
		readonly attribute Storage       preferences; // key value
		void openURL(in DOMString iri);
	};
