After spending a week in France completely dependent on my
[modded](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/cyanogenmod-5-0-nexus-one) Nexus One
for my Internet use, I have gained some insights into the future of mobile
computing.

Besides niggles with the Google N1 device itself, the real "mobile Web" party
poopers are unsurprisingly the network operators.

Screen blanks out on a call and I can't get the hang up button, therefore charged for unused call time. :/

Device should detect voice mail and hangup to avoid expense. I can't be the only one who does not care for voice mail.

Does not rotate on the home screen. I'm concluding that Android's screen rotation is quite a UI mistake, compared to say Apple's design.

Can't rotate keyboard on SMS. That makes it harder to write SMSes. I am
seriously more likely to Gtalk or Email than write an SMS, simply because I
have a wider keyboard. If I was an operator I would be jumping up and down
about this.

Can't figure out how to make incoming SMSes vibrate. After searching I find
this seems to be a general gripe about Android 2.1.

The answer swipe is a bit brain dead.

I forgot my USB cable. So it made it impossible to share some new music from my Swedish friends. There must be an easier way to peer to peer.

Same goes for side loading applications. It's not obvious how to share apps and
that just sucks. There are plenty of cases where you want to peer since
operators suck.

The photo picker for example with the Buzz integrated Google maps does not work. Crap. The buzz uploader does not give any progress status.

Progress status and resumable uploads is a must for crappy mobile connections.

There is no call log. How long was a call? How much was a call? No idea. This **MUST** be fixed. I must know how much I am spending.

Acquiring location and policy control is a bit all over the place on Android.
For example the news & weather widget has it's own little preference for "Use
my location". I **need** an easy central [policy
control](http://dabase.com/blog/Why_policies/) [[policy_control|Why_policies]].
I also want to control granularity and see transaction logs, since I don't want
the weather man to know exactly where I am. I want to feel **in control**.

Lastly I just wanted to mention, is it just me or is the <http://touch.facebook.com/>
seriously broken? When people comment on pictures I can't seem to followup on
the notifications. I mean, this is not hard people.
