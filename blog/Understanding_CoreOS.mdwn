[CoreOS](http://coreos.com/) has come up on my radar a couple of times and I
decided to see what all the fuss about especially when they were soliciting
companies to pilot their software for 5000USD!

All credit to them for managing that.

# What's the attraction of running CoreOS over say Archlinux?

1. Automatic updates keep the base OS of CoreOS secure <http://coreos.com/using-coreos/updates/>
2. It runs Docker and Etcd

Ok, automatic updates are easy to understand. Right now I periodically run
`pacman -Syu` across the [servers](http://webconverger.org/servers/) I manage.
I update my laptop before my servers and obviously keep a close eye on
<https://www.archlinux.org/news/>. It's not absolutely bleeding edge since I
don't use `[testing]`. For the last years my Archlinux servers have been
wonderfully stable and productive. I'm also enjoying Archlinux's pioneering
work with systemd. 

I am trying to forget the days of using hopelessly out of date software on
Debian. You can't do interesting stuff with multimedia on Debian if you running
ancient versions of ffmpeg.

CoreOS proposes a base upgrade along the lines of ChromeOS. Tbh I don't have
experience of ChromeOS updates, though they must work. My big criticism of this
approach is that they might as well use gitfs like [Webconverger uses for
upgrades](http://webconverger.org/servers/). I'm also having a hard time understanding what CoreOS means by "base".

Is "base" LAMP? I.e. Apache/MariaDB/PHP?! Or all the databases and other crud
people think they need to run Node, Rails, Django or some other perverted Web
framework?  Personally I prefer just **one** highly tested canonical system
(not just base, everything), otherwise things get complex. Supporting different
types of configurations via packages sucks, because there is a permutation
explosion when it comes to variations how to do this. Maybe they'll propose a
"base system" for Rails, and another for "NodeJS & MongoDB" etc etc. At least
that avoids a "permutation explosion".

I am not so sure if I trust CoreOS developers to make the "base" choices for
me. Ultimately people get conservative and start running older and older
software. It will probably get mightily bloated too.

Update: I think the base OS is just for running several instances of say Ubuntu
in docker containers. Tbh I thought the containers would inherit the base
system OS entirely, but this doesn't seem to be the case.

# Wtf is Docker?

IIUC [Docker](http://www.docker.io/) is a fancy name of <abbr title="LinuX
Containers">LXC</abbr> aka "chroots done right" (but with a ton more
complexity).

So I think the idea is that you `git push` into a Docker container with the
underlying "standardised" / "stable" CoreOS OS and out pops your hosted vhost
Web application. I think this is the model OpenStack pushes hard. It's a good
model for the unwashed, but I find it a little claustrophobic.

I really miss doing some iterative development from the remote ssh shell.
Anyway, most "developers" push out using FTP, so this is a marked improvement,
for sure.

# And Wtf is etcd?

[Etcd](http://coreos.com/blog/distributed-configuration-with-etcd/) as I understand it, is used for two things:

1. Key value store for configuration data like the Windows Registry, for services running on CoreOS
2. Some tools to manage the distribution / control of the services

Key, value store is easy to imagine. But how does that map to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` one might be thinking?

Well ideally I'm told that services talk directly with etcd, but if they can't like most Linux services, they need to talk via [confd](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd), so you end up with something like:

	etcd -> confd -> /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Tbh I don't like this. I think you could simply manage [service configurations
in git](https://github.com/Webconverger/sg.webconverger.com) and use some sort
of hook to expand macros like HOSTNAME or whatever you need machine by machine.

The abstraction or mapping between etcd and a services config file, e.g.
`/etc/postfix/main.cf` is obviously going to be
[leaky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction). The only positive
point I can think of, is that it maybe over time... services like postfix,
nginx, apache et al to talk directly with etcd and gets rid of their particular
crufty configuration languages. I.e. make things much simpler for admins!

## What about this "tools to manage the distribution / control of the services" feature of etcd

Ok, you would think they would split this out to another tool name. Anyway, as
I understand it, etcd gives you **automation** abilities.

Lets pretend you are spinning up 30 machines to serve some Web service.
Without getting trapped into the <abbr title="Amazon Web services">AWS</abbr>
suite of tools, you would face lots of problems like:

1. monitoring the instances
2. knowing when the instances are online
3. adding instances to your load balancer

These are the use cases etcd is said to solve. You can't use Avahi for service
discovery when VPSes are spinning up around the world, CoreOS proposes
[Chubby](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/archive/chubby-osdi06.pdf)
instead.

So with that preamble, a good summary is given at the bottom of the <http://coreos.com/> page:

* minimal - linux + systemd (and their base OS they don't mention)
* containers - chroots ... yay
* service discovery ... like AWS's pioneering stuff but open

Good luck to CoreOS. I will be keeping a very close eye on their developments!
