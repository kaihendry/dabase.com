# Why would you want to sign a widget?

For the same reasons why you would sign a document or an email if you're
[GNUPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnupg) savvy. To say it comes from **you**
and as an added bonus to show that the files (contents) have their integrity
intact (i.e. they have not been tampered with!).

The [[bigger_idea|blog/JIL_versus_BONDI_on_Security]] with signatures is that
they will be used to control trust in the use of [device
APIs](http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/).

If you want your widget to be distributed by a major operator, you need to have
them sign your widget in order to approve of it. If later the operator has
found your Widget to be malicious, widget signatures can be revoked using [OCSP
verification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP).

# How does it work

1. You have a Widget package with a list of files
2. Each file gets hashed, e.g. `md5sum *`
3. Those filenames and hashes are put in a manifest and again all hashed, then signed with a private key

For some godforsaken reason we are using [XML
Signatures](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-digsig), however I suggest you read
Java's [jarsigner man
page](http://linux.die.net/man/1/jarsigner-java-1.6.0-openjdk). Ultimately
we're doing everything that `jarsigner` is doing, but using very complex and
fragile W3C XML suite of technologies. Whoops.

For purposes of a demonstration I've signed the widget twice, once as an
author `author-signature.xml` and once as a distributor `signature1.xml`, using
the same
[rsakey.p12](http://git.webvm.net/?p=wgtqa;a=blob;f=xmldsig/rsakey.p12).

Typically you would only sign it once in the capacity of just an author or just
a distributor, with your own key. To generate your own self-signed key look at the
**example.p12** target in the
[Makefile](http://git.webvm.net/?p=wgtqa;a=blob;f=xmldsig/Makefile).

If you prefer GUIs you should instead look at the [LiMo supported BONDI SDK](http://bondisdk.limofoundation.org/) <http://bondisdk.limofoundation.org/docs/Signing_a_Web_Widget/>.

# Verifying or validating a widget

Since we are using test self-signed keys and not chaining to a root, we are
strictly speaking not verifying a widget, we are validating its signatures
instead.

If you run `make validate` you'll should see something like:

	./validate-widget-signature.sh --pkcs12 /tmp/wgtqa/xmldsig/rsakey.p12 --pwd secret helloworld.wgt
	Archive:  helloworld.wgt
	  inflating: /tmp/.13485/index.html
	  inflating: /tmp/.13485/author-signature.xml
	  inflating: /tmp/.13485/signature1.xml
	  inflating: /tmp/.13485/config.xml
	./author-signature.xml
	Signature method RSA
	if xmlsec1 verify --pkcs12 /tmp/wgtqa/xmldsig/rsakey.p12 --pwd secret ./author-signature.xml
	func=xmlSecOpenSSLX509StoreVerify:file=x509vfy.c:line=360:obj=x509-store:subj=X509_verify_cert:error=4:crypto library function failed:subj=/C=GB/ST=Surrey/L=Guildford/CN=test.webvm.net;err=18;msg=self signed certificate

<http://git.webvm.net/?p=wgtqa;a=blob;f=xmldsig/validate-widget-signature.sh>
validates the widget in one of two ways. It can try validate the
**SignatureValue** using a key you provide, e.g. `--pkcs12
/tmp/wgtqa/xmldsig/rsakey.p12` in this case.

Or it can try extract the public key from the X509Certificate which can get
embedded within the signature.

So in practice a widget verification would be:

1. Extracting out the public key from the Keyinfo-X509Data-X509Certificate part
2. Checking the hashed widget contents against each referenced resources (SignedInfo)
3. Canonicalising that SignedInfo and then using that public key to check the SignatureValue
4. Then **verifying** the key is correctly chained up to a root certificate you trust

In fact I have a **validation** Web service that does the first 3 steps at <http://test.webvm.net/>

# Wait, there's more

What new element <http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-digsig> introduces to XML
digital signature, is the [SignatureProperty
identifier](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-digsig/#identifier-signature-property)
which lies typically inside a `<Object Id="prop">` element. This has to be
unique and in my scripts I simply call a [uuid generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid).

So that's basically it. A widget can contain a single author signature and many
several distributor signatures. The signatures are generated the same way with
a:

1. SignedInfo section which is the manifest, filenames and hashes
2. KeyInfo - any details of the key
3. Object bit, for identifying the signature itself (btw this gets hashed too in the SignedInfo as `URI="#prop"`!)

I've modified a [RelaxNG schema for Widget digital
signatures](http://git.webvm.net/?p=wgtqa;a=blob;f=xmldsig/xmldsig.rnc), so you
too can check the signature is correctly structured.
