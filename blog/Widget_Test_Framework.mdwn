Intro: As part of the [W3C Mobile Web Test Suites Working
Group](http://www.w3.org/2005/MWI/Tests/) I'm organising tests of the Widget
runtime, in which W3C compliant run times implement [Widgets 1.0: Packaging and
Configuration](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/)

# WGTQA

To begin with individual tests were written by hand in a [wgtqa git
repository](http://git.webvm.net/?p=wgtqa). My employer
[Aplix](http://www.aplixcorp.com) supported the work as it would be useful to
partake in compliance efforts for both BONDI RI and our own commercial [widget
runtime offerings](http://webvm.net).

I made a couple of mistakes. They were mostly interactive tests and didn't make
use of Javascript to automate them in several cases. For example:

	5.7-startfile-pass1/
	index.html:
		<h1 style="background: green;">PASSED</h1>

Firstly I tried to pin the name of the test on the section of the
[specification](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/) it was testing.
Unfortunately the numbering changed, so **5.7** had worse than no meaning. It
became confusing and a huge pain to track to keep updated.

**index.html** as you can see just has a simple **PASSED** rendering. Great for
interactive tests, though useless for automation (very 90s). The "start file"
should have been a simple Javascript call to indicate the test case passed.

## Testing Error conditions

The next mistake was assuming a malformed config would halt processing. In
reality a Widget runtime will ignore bogus values. I wrote several [negative
tests for
config.xml](http://git.webvm.net/?p=wgtqa;a=blob;f=wgt/7.1-wrong-namespace/config.xml),
which wrongly assumed that if the index.html was seen, it would be a FAIL.
i.e. the UA would halt and show the widget has been rejected.

A better test would be check the _default values_ were set when a bad one was
given. Unfortunately [Widget APIs](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets-api/) are
required to read back and test such values. This API is not available on any
current widget runtime like BONDI or Opera AFAIK.

So you can't really do negative tests, instead you need to check default values
instead.

# WTF !

The "Widget Testing Framework" (WTF) is a [PHP Zend](http://www.zend.com)
powered contribution by [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), which basically deals
with the earlier automation problem. WTF comes without any substantial
tests, though Opera has stated they will share some of their tests.

For example, lets look at a [test which tests the order in which index files
are run](http://wtf.webvm.net/view//step8/order). So the start files are
modified from the index template from `data/std_includes/index.html` which
references testpass.js:`testcase.result(true);` on the first case and
testfail.js:`testcase.result(false);` on all the others:

1. index.htm -- PASS
1. index.html -- FAIL
1. index.svg -- FAIL
1. index.xhtml -- FAIL
1. index.xht -- FAIL

When the widget is [downloaded](http://wtf.webvm.net/download//step8/order) a
testlib.js & style.css is also included in the widget. `testpass.js` executes
the function implemented by testlib.js which reports the test result with the
magic of AJAX to a configurable **reporturi**. Unfortunately the backend
service for this isn't provided yet by Opera, though it shouldn't be hard to
recreate.

So the framework builds the widget on the fly. Sooner or later, you'll realise
this is good testing framework for mainly checking to see if the Javascript
APIs e.g. [BONDI](http://bondi.webvm.net/apis/) &
[W3C](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/) for different
features works correctly within a widget.

Though not good for testing things like broken
[zips](http://git.webvm.net/?p=wgtqa;a=tree;f=gen/5.1-compression-level;) and
odd filenames and screwy encodings and such things, **before** a widget is
actually running. So WTF is not a "silver bullet", a solution for all problems
related to ensuring W3C Widget runtime conformance.

## Non-interactive interactive tests

In terms of processing a test, there are 3 types:

1. Automated
1. Visual
1. Interactive

Automated tests are best. You could run all you automated tests via a test
harness (which you need to write) after every change to your Widget runtime for
example. Hence this would become also known as a regression test suite.

Visual tests are generally written as [interactive tests at
first](http://wtf.webvm.net/view/image_media_support). The tester is basically
looking out for some green blob and then to mark it off with a button control.

You do not want expensive, labour intensive, mind numbing interactive tests.
Imagine for every test run after a source check in, having to mark whether you
saw a green blob or not?

Opera has an übercool internal system called SPARTAN which hashes these values
(those green blobs), so that these interactive (bad) tests can become like
automated (good) visual tests. Since SPARTAN isn't public, 'visual tests' will
remain 'interactive tests'.

# Open issues

## `config.xml` validation

We know what makes an invalid config.xml with [Widget RelaxNG
schema](http://hasather.net/widgets/widgets.rnc). I've written a [widget
validator](http://wgt.webvm.net/) which uses
[rnv](http://www.davidashen.net/rnv.html).

This is what a UA should do before running a widget, though how do you test a
UA (widget runtime) is doing the same as:

	rnv -q widget.rnc config.xml

That's quite hard.

## Pinning tests

Anchor names seem more stable than section names, but still it seems a little
hard to reference the part of the specification, the test is actually testing.

Alternatively, HTML5 uses an [annotation
system](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/status-documentation.html)
for linking to tests from the specification.

## Making the WTF properly opensourced with open SCM hosting etc. etc.

The Widget Test Framework is Opera specific atm and needs several changes.

My copy is (publicly available in Mercurial](http://wtf.webvm.net/hgweb.cgi).

## Test harness

Something to run the tests and collect the tests results is needed.

## Visual tests

A system like SPARTAN is needed.

# Notes on different Widget runtimes

## Opera does not allow `alert()`
