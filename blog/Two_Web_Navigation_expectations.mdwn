# Rule 1

## Have a URL that addresses the use case as clearly as possible.

Everytime I see help documents that has something like: Menu &rarr; Settings
&rarr; Advanced Settings &rarr; Network &rarr; Add, I **cringe**.

The URL should be something like https://example.com/settings/network/add.
Plain and simple. Firefox is terrible at this and Chrome's are much better with
items like <chrome://settings/certificates>, but many of them are inconsistent
and not used from their own [awful accordian style
documentation](https://support.google.com/chrome/), which goes on to break
**Rule 2**.

Other times, I have a particular question and I can only find an answer perhaps
on an outdated forum. The service I am dealing with should have the canonical
answer on a [[FAQ that does not suck|How to create a FAQ that does not suck]].

# Rule 2

## Make the site Ctrl+F-able

One of my learnings about how people use <http://greptweet.com/> is that people
prefer Ctrl+F instead of actually using the search box.

Chrome's Ctrl+F is fast, gives great highlight indicators to matched word,
number of matches and where they are in the document by markers on the
scrollbar. Yes bizaarely, a lot of resources on the Web can be easily searched.

The very worse example I've found is Paypal's new 2014 UI refresh. Settings are
