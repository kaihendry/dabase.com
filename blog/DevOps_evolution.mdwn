Ignoring the complexities surrounding data.

# Phase 1

Manual everything.

Not scalable at all.

# Phase 2

Using a [Configuration
Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management) tool like
Chef, Puppet or Ansible.

Scalability achieved with AMI snapshots and such. Zero downtime with an
[ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/).

# Phase 3

Using <abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr> like
[Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku), so a developer can `git push` to a
"[Heroku-ish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish)" endpoint.

Probably can't scale very well. Zero downtime can be achieved cheaply using
[some
tricks](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/zero-downtime-deploys/).
Probably best solution for personal projects or starting out since it's fairly
simple.

# Phase 4

Using Docker & containerizing all the things on something like
[CoreOS](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/) or RancherOS. Scalability is
as manual as making sure you can quickly spin up new CoreOS instances & run the
Docker images with a load balancer in front.

Bonus points is if one has figured out how to get a <abbr title="Continuous
Integration">CI</abbr> to build the image and deploy it.

Bonus points for running two instances for Blue/Green deployments behind the
load balancer for zero downtime.

# Phase 5

Orchestrating Docker deployments with [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), using things like <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_Console_Repositories.html">AWS <abbr
title="Elastic Container Repository">ECR</abbr> (private Docker image hosting)</a>
and AWS <abbr title="Elastic Container Service">ECS</abbr> for managing the
containers on EC2.

Tip: Getting into ECS like myself? Checkout [[ECS questions]]!

Scales rather well. Quite complex and heavyweight.

# Phase 6

Serverless computing? [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/)

Most apps would probably have to be completely rewritten and tied to the
hosting platform in question.
