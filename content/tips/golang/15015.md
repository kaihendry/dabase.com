title: Testing by Go Playground example
---

I really like the [test by example](https://blog.golang.org/examples) feature in Go. Not many people know this actually works in the Go playground like so: https://play.golang.org/p/UIYvV19R-H6

Furthermore the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org) has a **Tests** dropdown https://play.golang.org/p/kIZkoT2EvJX for [Table driven tests](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-test)!


If you like this tip, you might want to use a [proper editor like vim as follow my video tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1pI1GrLFyM).
