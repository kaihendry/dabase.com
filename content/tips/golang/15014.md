Fix with Apex Up is to introduce a build hook:

	  "hooks": {
		"build": "CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o server *.go"
	  },

Go static binaries assume GLIBC is compatible, and it turns out, Archlinux and AWS's runtime differ!

	[hendry@t14s ]$ lddtree
	 (interpreter => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2)
		libpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0
		libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6
	[hendry@t14s ]$ CGO_ENABLED=0 go build
	[hendry@t14s ]$ lddtree
	 (interpreter => None)
	[hendry@t14s ]$

I'm not sure why by default Go's static binaries depends on GLIBC.
