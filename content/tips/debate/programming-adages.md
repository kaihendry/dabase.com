<blockquote>
 <p>[T]he difference between a bad programmer and a
good one is whether he considers his code or his
data structures more important. Bad programmers
worry about the code. Good programmers worry about
data structures and their relationships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Linus Torvalds</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Clarity and brevity sometimes are at odds.
When they are, I choose clarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Jacob Kaplan-Moss</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>The competent programmer is fully aware of
the limited size of his own skull. He therefore
approaches his task with full humility,
and avoids clever tricks like the plague.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Edsger Dijkstra</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Optimism is an occupational hazard of
programming; feedback is the treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Kent Beck</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Make it work, make it right, make it fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Kent Beck</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Any fool can write code that a computer
can understand. Good programmers write
code that humans can understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Martin Fowler</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A lot of times, people don&#39;t know what
they want until you show it to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Steve Jobs</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Innovation is not about saying yes to
everything. It&#39;s about saying NO to
all but the most crucial features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Steve Jobs</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Controlling complexity is the essence
of computer programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Brian Kernigan</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Always code as if the guy who ends up
maintaining your code will be a violent
psychopath who knows where you live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Martin Golding</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Nine people can&#39;t make a baby in a month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A clever person solves a problem. A wise
person avoids it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Albert Einstein</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>A language that doesn&#39;t affect the way you
think about programming is not worth knowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Alan J. Perlis</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>Don&#39;t gloss over a routine or piece of code
involved in the bug because you &#34;know&#34; it
works. Prove it. Prove it in this context,
with this data, with these boundary conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Andrew Hunt</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>If you ever talk to a great programmer, you&#39;ll
find they know their tools like an artist knows
their paintbrushes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Bill Gates</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the
first 90 percent of the development time. The
remaining 10 percent of the code account for the
other 90 percent of the development time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Tom Cargill</p>
