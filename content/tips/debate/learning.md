# 70-20-10 Model

1. 70% of their knowledge from job-related experiences
2. 20% from interactions with others
3. 10% from formal educational events

# Five needs

The five needs occur:

1. When learning for the first time
2. When wanting to learn more
3. When trying to remember and/or apply
4. After change
5. When something goes wrong (debugging)

# Kirkpatrick's model

1. Level 1 - reaction - do participants respond?
2. Level 2 - learning - what skills improved?
3. Level 3 - behaviour - was it applied
4. Level 4 - results - was there any organisational benefit
