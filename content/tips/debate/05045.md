# On short term capitalism

<blockquote>
Shareholder value is an outcome - not a strategy Shareholder value is a
result, not a strategyâ€¦Your main constituencies are your employees, your
customers, and your products.
</blockquote>

- Jack Welch via the [Digital Transformation Game Plan](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/digital-transformation-game/9781492054382/) book (which I recommend btw)

# On equality

[Netherlands in the most unequal place on earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot4qdCs54ZE&feature=youtu.be)

My take aways:

1. Houses are expensive so low middle class need to borrow more than can earn and hence people are under water (i.e. negative net worth)
2. Dutch have many old (~400 years) wealthy families

# On code / digitisation

	If you are not looking at code, what are you doing?
