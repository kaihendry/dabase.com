Since people behave as they are measured, it is better to track the outcomes.

"reduced time to go live" > "how many times did the build fail?"

Similar with testing. [Verify behaviour](https://youtu.be/EZ05e7EMOLM), focus
on your public contract, not implmentation details (hint: avoid heavy mocking).
