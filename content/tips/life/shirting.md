My collar size appears to be 43cm or 17inch. My sleeze size is 89cm or 35inch.
It's **critical to get the sizing right**. As you can see, it too a little trial
and error from my side.

* [Slim fit 39/89cm](https://s.natalian.org/2021-03-09/too-tight-white.jpeg) - too tight
* [Slim fit 42/86cm](https://s.natalian.org/2021-03-09/sleeves-too-short.jpeg) - sleeves too short
* [Slim fit 43/89cm](https://s.natalian.org/2021-03-09/perfect-fit.jpeg) - perfect fit

Unfortunately the [Website confusingly is only in inches](https://www.ctshirts.com/intl/my-sizes), which has lead me to make mistakes in the past.
