Is there a good comparison between using either Cloudformation or Terraform for a project? i.e. what can Cloudformation do that Terraform can't?

It feels like there should be a great "go to" place for this, but I can't see one. Terraform can do everything cloudformation can, and more, it's faster to adopt new features, has a nicer language, etc. But on the other side, Cloudformation has lots of support from AWS

I agree with Philipp, if you're starting from scratch your choice should likely be between the CDK and Terraform, not Cloudformation and Terraform

CDK is not declarative which puts me right off

if you find something useful in cdk, then you can have it spit out a cloudformation template
Philipp Garbe  14 hours ago
For me that's the advantage that CDK is not declarative. At some point you'll find yourself in a situation where you have to repeat yourself, copy&paste things, apply changes in multiple repos. That's where CDK can help you.

I'm not sure about the current state of the terraform docs, but in the past and for other hashicorp bits I've used it seems you're often stuck reading github issues and commit messages to find documentation.

I disagree strongly with "CDK is better than CloudFormation in every situation'. One of the advantages of CFN is that it's completely managed by AWS. If we're going to make broad statements, I'd argue that that makes cloudformation the more serverless/cloud-native solution

I've yet to be convinced by cdk except as a shortcut to get an example cloudformation template

re: number of resources, that's mostly not as big of an issue as it would appear.
of supported resources is less important than "does it support the resources I want to use"
New services are more frequently releasing with CFN support from day one
Both terraform and CFN can be extended with your custom resource provider (terraform front-loads that work by having you setup an environment to run terraform in as the first step; which makes it sometimes a bit easier to get started with development. oth all you need for non-custom CloudFormation is an editor)

About declarative vs imperative: The IaC part of CDK is still declarative as it is CFN. Only the way to generate the template is imperative. But all the benefits of declarative infra definition still hold
Ben Bridts  14 hours ago
You lose the benefits of using a declarative DSL. You can argue about how important that is, but splitting up the generation from deployment is an implementation detail, not the direction that CDK encourages you to take (edited)

We looked at CDK but the learning curve for a the team was steep for it to basically do the same thing as CFN yaml, so we did not move forward with it. Would be nice if CFN vastly improved its syntax support and maybe support for important the code for 3rd party Modules in TF format as there is already a huge library. And a way to public the custom resource to all accounts in the AWS organisation.

It’s now infrastructure-as-declarative-code vs infrastructure-as-imperative-code. :smile:

At least it’s as-code :smile:
