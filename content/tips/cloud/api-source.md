When boto updates:
https://github.com/boto/botocore/commit/d9d692f7a350417480f8eb9592d8b0c936b6825a

Or the AWS GO SDK updates:
https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/pull/1507

Where are the original **models**?


Is it the [CloudFormation resource provider schemas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-type-schemas.html)?
