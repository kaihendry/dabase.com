> Can I make Dependabot automatically update the dependencies? I.e. avoid a manual merge?

Auto-merge will not be supported in GitHub-native Dependabot for the foreseeable future. At this time, our concern is about auto-merge being used to quickly propagate a malicious package across the ecosystem. We recommend always verifying your dependencies before merging them.

I'm sorry that's probably not what you were hoping to here. Feel free to reach
back with any questions you might have.
