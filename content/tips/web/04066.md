title: Absolutely minimal Hugo static site
---

I prefer this over the https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ which
asks you to download a heavyweight/complex theme!

This currently works in **Hugo Static Site Generator v0.75.1/extended**:

	hugo new site testing
	cd testing
	echo -e "<h1>layouts</h1>\n{{ .Content }}" > layouts/index.html
	echo "# content" > content/_index.md
	hugo serve

Notice you **require** a layouts file, and [look up order is quite
complex](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/)!

Note in many cases your [Markdown in Hugo requires
Frontmatter](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6098). So just bear that
in mind when creating more markdown posts.
