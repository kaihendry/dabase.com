You can set up a Custom Keyword for instantly accessing Python module documentation using the string www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-%s.html - I have this set up as pydoc, so I can type pydoc re to jump straight to the re module documentation. I only set it up half an hour ago and I've already used it about a dozen times.
