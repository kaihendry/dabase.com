title: Converting ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8
description: Detecting encodings and converting them with CLI tools

Go doesn't [automatically transform content in the other
encodings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64565950). You need to check
your inputs and the way I'm doing it is like so.


# Detect encoding of a file

	$ uchardet data.txt
	ISO-8859-1
	$ file data.txt
	data.txt: ISO-8859 text

# Converting ISO-8859-1 encoding to UTF-8

	curl -s http://maps.natalian.org/data.txt | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 > data.txt
