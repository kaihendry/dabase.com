title: Two types of Variables

	[hendry@t14s e]$ cat envfile
	FOO=BAR
	[hendry@t14s e]$ source ./envfile
	[hendry@t14s e]$ echo $FOO
	BAR
	[hendry@t14s e]$ printenv | grep FOO
	[hendry@t14s e]$

Why isn't FOO in the environment? Because it was not **exported**!

Bash has two types of variables. Shell Variables (foo=bar) live in the running
shell and are copied to subshells. Environment Variables (export foo=bar) are
special variables that live in a PROCESS and are copied to each new process it
creates. They are used the same way but CREATED differently. Env vars are NOT
system-wide or "shared" in any way. <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Environment>
