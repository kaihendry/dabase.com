1. **Make your requirements less dumb** - question requirements even from a smart person
2. Try hard to **Delete the part or process**, if you're occassionally not adding back in, you're not deleting enough!
3. **Simplify or Optimise** - biggest mistake optimise something that shouldn't exist
4. **Accelerate** cycle time (improve iteration speed)
5. **Automate**

Elon [admits he made the mistake of going backwards](https://youtu.be/WN90HYiFpAw?t=203).
