# Terminal

I use https://alacritty.org though since it can freeze on my Arch
machine, I also use https://st.suckless.org which is more
reliable for my on Xorg.

## Copying text on the Terminal

    selection:
      save_to_clipboard: true

Over the years I've used computers, I'm most familiar with copy
on selection when using a terminal.

I don't use vi bindings for visual selection or tmux etc.

## Pasting on the terminal

Historically it's a middle mouse click for pasting, though I'm
more familar with:

    ⌘ / CMD + v
    Ctrl + v

## Scrolling the terminal

I'm used to using the mouse and ideally searching with <kbd>Ctrl+f</kbd>.

## Resizing the Terminal

I'm most familiar with <kbd>Ctrl + -</kbd>.

## Links on the Terminal

Alacritty's default behaviour of underling links on hover and clicking them it's best for me.

# Browser

## Copying text

Here I do not want copy on selection, but this happens automatically on a Linux machine. To prevent unwanted overwriting of my clipboard, I rely on a clipboard manager.

- https://github.com/cdown/clipmenu on Archlinux
- https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/clipboard/ on MacOS

## Pasting text on a browser

    ⌘ / CMD + v
    Ctrl + v
