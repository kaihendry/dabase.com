Super_L (mod4) should be left of the space bar, if you find Alt_L (mod1) & Super_L (mod4) reversed you need to fix it like so:

    setxkbmap -option altwin:swap_alt_win

You can check the bind using `xev`.

A "Mac" style keyboard like these "MX Keys for Mac" are nice, big and don't have the Function key confusing matters:

# Terminal

I like the cross-platform Terminal https://alacritty.org though since it can freeze on my Xorg Arch
machine whilst idle ðŸ¤·, I also use https://st.suckless.org which is more
reliable for my on Xorg.

## Copying text on the Terminal

    selection:
      save_to_clipboard: true

Over the years I've used computers, I'm most familiar with copy
on selection when using a terminal.

I don't use vi bindings for visual selection or tmux etc.

## Pasting on the terminal

Historically it's a middle mouse click for pasting, though I'm
more familar with:

    mod4 + v

## Scrolling the terminal

I'm used to using the mouse and ideally searching with <kbd>Ctrl+f</kbd>.

## Resizing the Terminal

I'm most familiar with <kbd>Ctrl + -</kbd>.

## Links on the Terminal

Alacritty's default behaviour of underling links on hover and clicking them it's best for me.

# Browser

## Copying text

Here I do not want copy on selection, but this happens automatically on a Linux machine. To prevent unwanted overwriting of my clipboard, I rely on a clipboard manager.

## Pasting text on a browser

    mod4 + v - works in google-chrome-stable
