description: Commenting on the tech scene in Cornwall lack of infrastructure

# Context

UK is in a recession.  Cornwall is one of the poorest areas in the United
Kingdom. Like many places in the world, tech is seen as a way to grow the local
economy. Since I live in Cornwall I am interested to see the tech scene grow,
though I want to be pragmatic and document the infrastructure challenges from my perspective.

In the past few months, a major tech employer in Truro (a games company)
shutdown. The [tech event location
Heartlands](https://www.heartlandscornwall.com/) went into administration.
Space port Cornwall has a [failed
launch](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-64253375) and paused
operations.

# The event

The [The BIG Cornish Tech
Showcase](https://softwarecornwall.org/event/the-big-cornish-tech-showcase/)
happened nonetheless, in the empty offices of [Space port
Cornwall](https://spaceportcornwall.com/), which I thought was serendipitous.

The event was well organised and well attended considering its remote location,
though for me there was a distinct lack of developers. The kick off mentioned
there was a lack of talent in the county, which reinforced my impression.

# The future

For me we need a place where developers can meet, work, socialise and learn
from each other, and since the typical venue "Heartlands" is gone, I really
wonder where that will be.

It needs to be close to a University and a train station. Accessible by public transport.

Ideally it's a destination for remote workers, somewhere they can enjoy
seafood, enjoy the natural beauty and perhaps surf. Ideally it has good, cheap
local accommodation for people to stay a bit longer.

On a positive note, fibre broadband is pretty pervasive in Cornwall. During the
summer people can happily camp in a tent.
