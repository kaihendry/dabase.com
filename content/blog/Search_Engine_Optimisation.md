So you've been told your site needs some <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>. Why?

You Google search for your product's keywords or simply your company name and it does not
appear on the first page of Google results.

Hence your customers can't find your site and services and you _lose business_.

So why does Google give you such a poor pagerank? Go check it on
<http://www.prchecker.info/>. Is it zero? I thought so.

Your site is probably both:

* Badly coded
* Lacking information

How can you tell your site is badly coded? Simply run <http://validator.nu/>
over every page. Errors? Well fix them! Make your pages HTML5 compliant.

As for **lacking information**, the Web is all about **information**. Not
whizzy flash bang graphics. If your site is information dense and relevant,
your pagerank will rise.

* Do you show basic contact details on every page?
* If you are at a fixed address, give co-ordinates to your location!
* Forget the feedback form, just have an email address clearly advertised.
* Is all that information spell checked and crystal clear?
* It is OK to have everything on one page (think Wikipedia)

If you sell a product or service, show that you are the expert by demonstrating
how much you know about it in a clear and concise manner.

Finally see what the Google robot sees! Try your site with my new service <http://robot.dabase.com>.

Does you page look intelligible? Can you see all your keywords on the text
output? See for example my homepage
<http://robot.dabase.com/http://hendry.iki.fi> and compare to your site.
