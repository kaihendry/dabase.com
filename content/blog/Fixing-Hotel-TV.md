What's wrong with this picture?

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2021-07-04/hotel-tv.jpeg" alt="Hotel wifi">

1. It's cropped aka [overscanned](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202763)
2. Fonts rendering looks awful on the 1080p SMART TV

# Fixing the crop

1. Try reconnect port to PC/DVI port
2. Disable **overscan**, however your [TV Remote](https://s.natalian.org/2021-07-04/hotel-tv-remote.jpeg) will probably **not allow** you to change this setting

# Fixing the legibility of text on a TV

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2021-07-04/tv-text.jpeg" alt="1080p TV displaying text outputed from Safari/M1">

1. Can you up the sharpness? Probably not.
2. Pixel density probably prohibits fine text

TVs also tend to mess around with the colours / compression / scaling and
ultimately it's a huge chore to turn it off. Your [hotel
remote](https://s.natalian.org/2021-07-04/hotel-tv-remote.jpeg) probably will not have
the option even to change such settings!

# Conclusion

There are some workarounds, but Hotel TVs probably won't allow you to adjust these settings.

Don't rely on a TV for doing any work.
