description: My iPhone 64GB is too small for keeping your chats

So my iPhone 11 Pro Max 64GB (NWHH2ZP/A) is full. I bought the 64GB even though
I had 256GB before on the previous model.. because I noticed I never used much
more than 50. Now I have run out of space and I am having a TERRIBLE UX, with
various Apps crashing and Mail not loading or being able to be sent!

I will buy the new iPhone 12 with a bigger size as soon as it comes out, but
until then, I need to find a workaround!!

# WhatsApp on the Cloud

It appears to be my largest spend at 7GB.

I am a data hoarder in the sense I would like to keep my old chats and media
ideally.

I do have a recent backup:

But unlike Apple Photos which optimises your local copy with the Cloud... I
still have the local chats IIUC. Now this is my confusion. Despite having my
WhatsApp chats in the cloud... am I supposed to delete the chats nonetheless to
save space!?

And therefore those chats are deleted from the Cloud backup and lost forever?!
