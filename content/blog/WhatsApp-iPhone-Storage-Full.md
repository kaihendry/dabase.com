So my iPhone 11 Pro Max 64GB (NWHH2ZP/A) is **full**. I bought the lowest sized
64GB even though I had 256GB before on the previous model.. because I noticed I
never used much more than 50GB. Now I have run out of space and I am having a
TERRIBLE UX, with various _Apps crashing and Mail not loading or being able to
be sent_!

I will buy the new iPhone 12 with a bigger size as soon as it comes out, but
until then, I need to find a workaround!!

# WhatsApp on the Cloud

It appears to be my largest spend at 7GB.

I am a data hoarder in the sense I would like to keep my old chats and media
ideally.

I do have a recent backup:

But unlike Apple Photos which optimises your local copy with the Cloud... I
still have the local chats taking space IIUC. Now this is my confusion. Despite
having my WhatsApp chats in the cloud... am I supposed to delete the chats
nonetheless to save space!?

And therefore those chats are deleted from the Cloud backup and lost forever?!

Before anyone suggests I don't have enough iCloud space, have a look at:

# Other ...

It would appear **Other**, which includes cache/logs is taking a third of my iPhone's storage space. WTH!!
