# Showcase

Record a **one minute screencast** to demonstrate the "Done" card. Make sure it
is [encoded as an MP4 with
ffmpeg](https://s.natalian.org/2021-10-05/htmlvideo.txt) and at a well known
location for sharing.

Showcase **live** to ensure a fluid interation with stakeholders, and only
fallback to the screencast if something goes wrong or you want to **share
wider** with people who did not attend.

# Retrospective

Read out:

>	Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that
>	everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time,
>	their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at
>	hand.

* Ensure team members are comfortable sharing - consider private time
* Objective: honest feedback to drive improvements
* Ideally <abbr title="Product Owner">PO</abbr> participates
