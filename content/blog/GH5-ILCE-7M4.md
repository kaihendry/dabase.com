[Image quality and autofocus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG9-EbQ6dfg) is amazing compared to the GH5.

The USB capture device is wonderful. No need for a seperate [capture card](https://www.carousell.sg/p/4k-avermedia-bu113-streamer-capture-1157209385/).

I love how you can charge the Sony battery via USB-C.

## Steady shot

Stabilisation is not as good as the GH5. [Steady shot must be set as Active](https://www.sony.com.sg/electronics/support/software/00255074#SteadyShot) and you can get better results if you stabilise the clip with **Catalyst Browse**. However it takes ~20 minutes easily on a 5 minute clip to render!

Perhaps the lens [SEL20F18G](https://www.sony-asia.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel20f18g/specifications) is missing stabilisation??

[Menu / playback is
confusing](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/u5kj3q/playback_workflow_guide_wanted_for_ilce7m4/?),
the GH5 is actually much more usable. Just probably takes some getting used to.

## No way to delete all images (barring protected ones)

I was hoping to have a workflow where I protect images and then delete ones all
the other I don't care for. This suprisingly is [not
possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/u94jkt/deleting_all_but_protected_images/).

When **Continuous Shooting** (wowser, I feel pro!), you can protect and delete as a group, so it's workable.

You could also take video and produce a still from it.

## Imaging Edge

Still a poor experience but a little better than the GH5's "Panasonic Image App".

I can't quite work how to Remote shoot without this weird bluetooth / Direct
wifi dance. The camera is connected to my home's wifi and so is my phone, why
is this such a nightmare?

UPDATE: I think WiFi connections are only use in the [PC Remote functionality](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/udvc3m/can_i_avoid_direct_wifi_it_seems_to_only/i6ne7mr/)

## 4k 60fps

I can't seem to get this working!

Do I need to upgrade the SD card ...

I'm also dissapointed that S&Q 1fps 4k recording also seems to require a faster SD card!

for 1fps recording!? ðŸ¤¦ https://www.alphashooters.com/cameras/sony-a7iv/memory-cards/#memory-cards-for-sq-motion-shooting
