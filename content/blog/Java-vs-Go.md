[Modern Java](https://github.com/binkley/modern-java-practices) is a well known
and massive Ecosystem in the Enterprise.

Go (2009) on the other hand is probably best known as a "Google language",
notably powering Web Apps (APIs) and DevOps (Docker) workloads.

What are the strength and weaknesses of Java compared to Go?

- Mature JVM
- [Massive amount of libraries](https://mvnrepository.com/)
- Many devs in the market

- Confusing licensing terms
- Bloat everywhere
- Slow iterations
- No clear way to do one one thing
- Verbose
- Reliance on heavyweight tooling


What are the strength and weaknesses of Go compared to Java?

- Simple licensing
- [Simple language](https://golang.org/ref/spec)
- Strong standard library
- Build and packaging is part of the distribution
- Fast build times
- [Good libraries](https://pkg.go.dev/)
- https://play.golang.org/ makes it simple to share running code by URL

- Scarcity hiring Go developers
