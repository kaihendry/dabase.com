description: The office space my team needs
---

During COVID-19 working from home became the norm. Team work suffered.

We realise we need to bond. We need the oppurtunity to intensively work
together around a table.

Barring annual conferences and such, ideally we need to use office space as a way of ramping up a team.

The expectation is to be able to have a private room with a large table.

Ideally with a large shared monitor / screen.

Ideally kitted up like home, with USB-C docking stations. External inputs.

Ideally kitted up similiar to home, with A/V facilities (sound proofing), to
allow people to dial in via Zoom or something.

Ideally setup like home to be quiet and productive, no interruptions of an open space.

# Reality

I've noticed that [Office
redesign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_J3o8VU5rw) looks at best being able
to privately take calls away from your "shared" desk. This is not condusive for
team work.
