Problem: We need a venue to ramp up collaboration of teams in our post-pandemic
world in the limited time we have.

Solution: Re-imagine offices to facilitate team work and team bonding. Multiple
private rooms for different teams for intense collaboration that are ideally
can facilitate further remote collaboration.

# Context

During COVID-19 working from home became the norm. Team work has suffered.

We realize we need to bond. We need the opportunity to intensively work
together around a table.

Barring annual conferences, summits and such, ideally we need to use office
space as a way of ramping up a team.

Teams need private rooms with a large table; with a large shared monitor /
screen and conferencing capabilities for remote members to dial in. There
should be multiple docking stations for external inputs. 

Sound proofing is needed to minimise interruptions, and allow productivity and
focus.

# Reality

I have yet to come across an office design that has cracked it. For example,
I’ve noticed that LinkedIn office redesign looks at best being able to
privately take calls away from your “shared/social” desk. This is not conducive
for team work. An open office space does not work!

We don’t need offices to become like home; we need offices to facilitate face
to face team work and bonding.
