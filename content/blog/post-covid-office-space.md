Problem: We need a venue to ramp up collaboration of teams in our post-pandemic
world in the limited time we have.

Solution: Re-imagine offices to facilitate team work and team bonding. Private
rooms for intense collaboration that are ideally acoustically treated to
allow for further remote collaboration.

# Context

During COVID-19 working from home became the norm. Team work has suffered.

We realize we need to bond. We need the opportunity to intensively work
together around a table.

Barring annual conferences, summits and such, ideally we need to use office space as a
way of ramping up a team.

The team needs a private room with a large table.

Ideally with a large shared monitor / screen.

Ideally kitted up like home, with USB-C docking stations. External inputs.

Ideally kitted up similar to home, with A/V facilities (sound proofing), to
allow people to dial in via Zoom or something.

Ideally setup like home to be quiet and productive, no interruptions of an open space.

# Reality

I've noticed that [LinkedIn office
redesign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_J3o8VU5rw) looks at best being able
to privately take calls away from your "shared" desk. This is not conducive for
team work.

We don't need offices to become like home.

We need offices to facilitate face to face team work.
