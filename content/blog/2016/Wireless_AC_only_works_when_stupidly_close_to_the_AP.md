The **Qualcomm Atheros QCA9880 802.11nac** in my [Archer C7
v2](https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500) running OpenWRT 15.05 only
seems to perform when really close to the <abbr title="Access Point">AP</abbr>.
Btw I recommend [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) over the stock TP-LINK
firmware!! I found it faster for a start.

My first test was from behind my study door, about 5m from the <abbr
title="Access Point">AP</abbr>... ~15MB/sec

Second test from my study table where it was barely usable, aka out of range.
I'd say just over 10m away through a door.

The last test was almost 60MB/sec where my computer was right next to the AP.
