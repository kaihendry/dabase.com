On [Arch's Samba](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Samba) I found that I
had to set the password on an existing user like so `smbpasswd -a rufie`. I
have no idea where the password is actually stored. I found this would no work
unless the existing user was in PAM. You will get a `Could not find user BLAH
and no add script defined` otherwise.

# client /etc/fstab

# RAID1 configuration with USB drives

Btw I am actually RAID1 two external USB drives. It's **EXPERIMENTAL** at this
stage & I wouldn't recommend doing this.

* [btrfs filesystem usage /mnt/raid1/](http://s.natalian.org/2016-05-02/usage.txt)

Btw I [asked the samba
list](https://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2016-May/199652.html) for some
clarity regarding the PAM/passwd integration.
