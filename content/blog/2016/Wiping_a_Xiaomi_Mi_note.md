My friend came to me with his **Xiaomi Mi Note** that he was planning to sell,
but was unable to reset through the menus. I managed to reset it with `fastboot
-w` whilst holding I think 'Volume down' and the 'Power button' from a cold
boot.

Using `android-sdk-platform-tools /opt/android-sdk/platform-tools/fastboot` on
Archlinux. Here's the log:

	~$ fastboot -w
