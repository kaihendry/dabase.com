Typically on a Gsuite enabled company you have

1. A chat room
2. A mailing list

# Problem with the chat room

You will have a room that looks like: https://chat.google.com/room/${RANDOM_11_CHARS}

Issues:

1. Opaque room URL
2. No pin / topic
3. No way to link to a converation
4. No way to reference a message in a reply

# Problems with the mailing list

It looks like https://groups.google.com/a/${COMPANY}/g/${FRIENDLY_NAME}, which is good, but:

1. It's UX is even slower than Chat
2. People tend to use chat instead
3. If you [search with chat](https://s.natalian.org/2021-02-01/search-messages.png) you will not get Group results
4. If you [search Groups messages](https://s.natalian.org/2021-02-01/search-groups-conversations.png) you will not get chat results
