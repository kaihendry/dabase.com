description: Moving from playing to creating in Minecraft

After jumping the hurdle of getting [Microsoft
accounts](/blog/2021/kids-authenticate-to-microsoft/) for my children, and
buying Minecraft on every conceivable platform ðŸ¤‘, I've noticed my son wants to
**Mod**, aka modify the game.

I see my son loves the command block and the repeat block. He's been watching
videos on YouTube and I've been helping him with the syntax.

# Storing his work

He mostly plays between the Xbox and the Switch. Since the Switch can't network
without [Nintendo
online](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Membership-options/Membership-options-1374627.html)
and the Xbox can't network without Xbox live, we settled on using the Xbox for
networked / social play.

However when he creates his worlds on Xbox, there doesn't appear a robust way to save the world.

I tried using https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-bedrock-server/issues/398, but that has an issue whereby the command blocks don't work.

# Modding

My son loves building and I am scratching my head thinking how to encourage him.

Does https://education.minecraft.net/ help?
