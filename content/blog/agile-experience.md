# Traditional

The "waterfall" or "mini-waterfall".

Characterised by stressing deadlines and deliverables. I think it makes sense
in non-creative pursuits. I.e. waterfall makes sense when you are rolling out a
shrink wrapped solution like Google Workspaces in a fixed time frame.

# Agile, aka embracing change

Read the <https://agilemanifesto.org/> which is short and up there in quality
with the [US
constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Ratified_amendments).

The above diagram is of course based on an Awesome client relationship, though
an agile team can follow the same practices.

The irony of my experience with "agile" is that despite **Individuals and
interactions over processes and tools** there is a lot of process and weekly
delivery iterations that can be quite stressful when things go wrong.

## When does "agile" go wrong <abbr title="in my opinion">imo</abbr>?

* Team has to be incredibly strong, cohesive and cross functional (not overly
  hierarchical). When it's not, things go wrong because it will be difficult to
  align and deliver being human and all.

* Adopting ceremonies (aka meetings / bureaucracy) that might not make sense -
  there is a weird cottage industry around "agile". A lot of "middle managers"
  are trained in "agile" and they want to implement their learnings, but often
  I feel they don't really know why or they don't know of other tooling that
  might have eclipsed it. For example Jira is often used because it what middle
  managers know.  However it's awfully slow and feel like a crutch compared to
  other tools like Github Issues (which is a better tool imo at the time of
  writing). Some ideas, tools and rituals suck, and it can daunting to
  challenge them, especially when mandated by the client.

* Poor prioritisation and alignment of the backlog - often this has to do with
  a poor vision or product management in my experience. It needs an incredible
  amount of discipline to be useful. And then when it goes wrong, you need a
  constructive culture of accepting and documenting failure. This is uncommon,
  though needed for meaningful change and innovation.

* The <abbr title="business analyst">BA</abbr> has a lot of responsibility - in
  a team you cannot defer to the business analyst to do the talking. Better
  developers communicate independently. I view the <abbr title="business
  analyst">BA</abbr> as a facilitator. Ideally taking great notes and making
  people feel comfortable. That person doesn't need to be technical, and they
  should not be gate keepers, otherwise things can go wrong.

* Good pairing is pretty exhausting remotely with tools like Zoom with bad
  networks / audio. They often go wrong, lacking initiative to address them.

* Failure to revisit some ideas - Acceptance Criteria I feel can be so heavy
  weight that you don't want to revisit some "Done" cards. Though often enough
  chiseling away at a problem again and again gets that innovation you want.
  "Good enough" isn't right for me sometimes.

* Client requests for a Roadmap - this essentially leads to reluctance to make
  changes down the road. Client must participate in the agile process and
  perhaps learn from the business analyst how to report and convey value
  creation without the typical Roadmap. It's wrong when agile becomes
  waterfall.

* Launch ðŸš€ but no "landings" - teams often celebrate launches, or worse they
  just develop in silos without any connection to the real user of the
  software. Real software iterates on real users and often the client is the
  user and I often feel that can go wrong because they are second guessing
  their users demands. Tell tale sign of some disconnect is when there is no
  clear feedback channel for the user.

# Conclusion

Science is about critical thinking and I want to apply that to Agile Software
Development. My fear as a consultant is walking a tightrope of having structure
and process, without having the bravery or openness to test these rituals.  I
don't want to fool myself, and deliver [Emperor's New
Clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes). 

Agile works when it doesn't go wrong.
