# Traditional

The "waterfall" or "mini-waterfall".

Characterised by stressing deadlines and deliverables. I think it makes sense
in non-creative pursuits. I.e. waterfall makes sense when you are rolling out a
shrink wrapped solution like Google Workspaces in a fixed time frame.

# Agile, aka embracing change

Read the <https://agilemanifesto.org/> which is short and up there in quality
with the [US
amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Ratified_amendments).

The above diagram is of course based on an Awesome client relationship, though
an agile team can follow the same practices.

The irony of my experience with "agile" is that despite **Individuals and
interactions over processes and tools** there is a lot of process and weekly
delivery iterations that can be quite stressful when things go wrong.

## Why do things go wrong <abbr title="in my opinion">imo</abbr>?

* Team has to be incredibly strong, cohesive and cross functional (not overly
  hierarchical). Humans in this pandemic are really difficult.

* Adopting ceremonies (aka meetings / bureaucracy) that might not make sense -
  there is a weird cottage industry around "agile". A lot of "middle managers"
  are trained in "agile" and they want to implement their learnings, but often
  I feel they don't really know why or they don't know of other tooling that
  might have eclipsed it. For example Jira is often used because it what middle
  managers know.  However it's awfully slow and feel like a crutch compared to
  other tools like Github Issues (which is a better tool at the time of
  writing)

* Poor prioritisation of the backlog - often this has to do with a poor vision
  in my experience. It needs an incredible amount of detail to be useful. And
  then when it goes wrong, you need a constructice culture of accepting failure
  ideally, otherwise it can breed mistrust and resentment.

* The <abbr title="business analyst">BA</abbr> has a lot of responsibility - in
  a team you cannot defer to the business analyst to do the talking. Better
  developers communicate independently. I view the <abbr title="business
  analyst">BA</abbr> as a facilitator. That person doesn't need to be
  technical.

* Good pairing is pretty exhausting remotely with tools like Zoom with bad
  networks / audio

* Failure to revisit some ideas - Acceptance Criteria I feel can be so heavy
  weight that you don't want to revisit some elements of delivered business
  process. Though often enough chiseling away at a problem again and again gets
  that value you want.

* Client requests for a Roadmap - this essentially leads to reluctance to make
  changes down the road. Client needs to participate better and perhaps learn
  from the business analyst how to report and convey value creation without the
  typical Roadmap.

* Launch ðŸš€ but no "landings" - teams often celebrate launches, or worse they
  just develop in silos without any connection to the real user of the
  software. Real software iterates on real users and often the client is the
  user and I often feel that can go wrong because they are second guessing
  their users demands.

# Conclusion

Science is about critical thinking and I want to apply that to Agile Software
Development. My fear as a consultant is that we are walking this odd tightrope
between having structure and process, but having the honesty and bravery to
challenge these structures can be overlooked. I don't want to fool myself, so I
want to remind myself to be wary.
