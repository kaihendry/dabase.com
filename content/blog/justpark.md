Bodmin's Dennison Road Short stay car park charges between 09:00 - 16:00 Mon - Sun
* Up to 30 mins - 60p
* Up to 1 hour - £1.10
* Up to 2 hours - £2.10
* Up to 3 hours - £3.20

In the case you do not have cash, you are expected to use the JustPark app.

Purchasing 30 minutes of parking time with Just park is 1.10GBP. That's a 83% markup! How did we get from 60p to 1.10GBP?

I contacted the help line 01872 224698. No answer.

I went online to find parking@cornwall.gov.uk, and recieved the reply:

> There is a 10p surcharge for using Just Park, but I believe there are also charges of reminders etc that you can opt out of, Just Park is an app that can be used in our and other car parks so we have no access  to their systems

As you can see in the screenshot above, I painstakingly opted out of the insurance upsell and Justpark set the parking fee as 70p (not 60p) and has charged a whopping 40p for the convenience of using their app.
