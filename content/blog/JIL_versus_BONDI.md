So [what](http://www.jil.org/jil-forums/posts/list/42.page) are the differences between [BONDI](http://bondi.omtp.org) and [JIL](http://www.jil.org)?

# Part 1 -- Organisational differences

## [JIL](http://www.jil.org/) -- Joint Innovation Lab

It's unclear exactly when JIL begun, though this [commercial joint venture
under Dutch law](http://www.jil.org/jil-forums/user/agreement.page) was founded
by:

* [China Mobile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Mobile)
* [Vodafone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone)
* [Softbank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softbank)

Later [Verizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon) joined. So four rather
large [mobile
operators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_network_operators) from
each territory.

Can JIL scale to include other operators or members in respective territories?
It's unclear.

Notice there are no Web browser vendors involved in the venture.

After looking at JIL, it seems they have adopted most elements of the [W3C
widget P&C specification](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/) and extended it
in some (minor) ways. However JIL has not contributed any specification
material back to W3C
[discussion](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/).

Collectively they aim to [launch a software applications
store](http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE54B1O320090512) to
rival that of the Apple Itunes store.

## [BONDI](http://bondi.omtp.org) from the Open Mobile Terminal Platform

BONDI is an initiative from the [OMTP](http://www.omtp.org/) that begun around
March 2008. The need for device APIs on mobile devices were identified and
[BONDI](http://www.omtp.org/) was founded with
[members](http://www.omtp.org/Membership.aspx) largely based in Europe.

[Opera is the latest member of the
group](http://bondi.omtp.org/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=1). Both
[Opera](http://www.opera.com/) and [Access](http://www.access-company.com/) are
browser vendors, with a lot of mobile experience involved in BONDI.

[OMTP](http://www.omtp.org) are [members](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List) of the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/).

Nick Allot on OMTP's BONDI W3C positioning says it best:

	From the outset W3C has been the target SDO (Standards Organisation) for
	the BONDI specs. Considerable time and effort has been expended by both the
	office and the members on this relationship. To date I think we can
	congratulate ourselves on two major successes. Firstly, we have successfully
	contributed to the Widget P&C spec ensuring all the core feature and
	requirements of BONDI have been adopted in the current specification. Secondly,
	through the Device API security Workshop which OMTP co-chaired and the efforts
	with the Web Applications group, the new Device APIs and Policy working group
	is now set up and scoped precisely to mirror the BONDI work.

To date, BONDI **contributes** to the Web standards track whilst JIL **adopts**
(and fragments) [W3C widgets](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/).
