# My rules

Standups with a sense of urgency, i.e. not take 30 minutes!

When editing the weekly minutes use the shortcut @meeting notes building block in Google Docs.

Please have an Agenda which includes:

- Who is driving it
- Why the meeting
- Expected outputs
- Collaborate on the minutes
- Please use Slack for messaging, not Zoom ideally, to avoid messages being lost

For fast collaboration consider [huddling with Slack](/blog/2022/Slack-survival-tips/)

# Elon's rules

1. Avoid large meetings
1. Leave a meeting if youâ€™re not contributing
1. Forget the chain of command
1. Be clear, not clever
1. Ditch frequent meetings
1. Use common sense
