As a long life Linux user, I've now dabbled with a <abbr title="Sony
PlayStation 4">PS4</abbr> as a friend passed it onto me about two years ago.
Paying a subscription to [PlayStation
Plus](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/) to play Minecraft in my LAN
with
[itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server) was pretty off putting to say the least.

My son has been playing Roblox on the iPad. After installing Roblox on the
Xbox, I realise that the permissions are different as he's not allowed to
see any User generated content.
