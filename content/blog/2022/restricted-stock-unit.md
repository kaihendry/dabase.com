Imagine you are awarded 1000 <abbr title="Restricted Stock Units">RSUs</abbr>
as part of an annual equity compensation process.

If we looked up the relevant NASDAQ stock ticker and the price was 10USD, that
**means the current value is 10000USD**, however you can't cash that in!

The **restricted stock units** vest over four years, 25% at the end of each 12 month increment.

Example:

- 250 on November 15, 2023
- 250 on November 15, 2024
- 250 on November 15, 2025
- 250 on November 15, 2026

If your employment ends for any reason then any
unvested RSUs are automatically forfeited.

So essentially you must stay in employment to get ~2500 USD next
year in November 2023 and so forth.

Of course the value of the unit could go up or down.
