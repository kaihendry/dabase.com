Whenever I've bought an item from [Amazon](https://amazon.sg/) the process has
been straightforward to return **for any reason**, [except if the item came
from the US store](/blog/2021/AmazonSG/).

I bought an item I didn't need from Lazada. Moments later I tried to
cancel. No option to do that.

I tried to chat to the vendor and they replied:

> hi, lazada platform doesn't support wrong choice of purchase on customer own
> choice. that's beyond lazada platform policy.
> You can bring over the unopened parcel and exchange for other products but
> there is offset of 2% + SGD 2.49 that are charged by Lazada platform for the
> original purchase.
> exchange or top up to other products will need to be done within 7 days of
> receiving the parcel.

Be wary of whimsical shopping on Lazada in Singapore.
