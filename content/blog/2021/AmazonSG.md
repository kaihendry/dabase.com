I ordered a [KVM from
Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0817YFJKW/), shipped for free
from the United States for ~65USD.

It turned out I didn't want it, although it's painless to return an Amazon.SG
product, it's not if it comes from the US.

# Free outgoing, not on return

To my surprise I had to pay for shipping back to the US, and it costs about
23USD, about **a third of the product's value**.

I complained about the returns experience, but never heard anything.
