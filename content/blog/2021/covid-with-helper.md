My pfizer vaccinated helper has tested positive for COVID via a PCR result
obtained this morning.

She felt unwell with flu like symptoms yesterday. Her ART test yesterday was
negative, and at the doctor she had the PCR test.

She isolated immediately in her room as soon as she found out and messaged us
on our family WhatsApp group.

# Contacting health authorities

My helper submitted a form to say she has COVID:

I think (not sure), she will receive an "Isolation Order" according to "Protocol 3"

# So what do we do as a family?

My wife and I conducted ART tests, negative:

It's not clear what we need to do now from [the earlier
page](https://www.covid.gov.sg/exposed/hrw). We haven't received an SMS.
Tracetogether has not updated. After talking with friend, I think my wife and I
need to go and get PCR tests.

# Kids

Charlie got a positive ART on Saturday, but it was too late to go to clinic for
PCR. Sunday clinic closed. Monday clinic open but they warn they would charge
us 160SGD for a PCR test because he doesn't have symptoms. On Tuesday wife
found a local child friendly clinic that would help us and they went for tests.
Wednesday no results. Thursday, Wife -ve, Daughter -ve, Charles +ve with
isolation order. Urf.

There is no way to know if this mandatory form has been filled in already.
