description: Casio G Shock is cheaper to replace than to repair

As a consumer in 2021 I'm always grappling with our environment damaging throw
away culture.

I love products that are [made to
last](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/), but the truth is; the **costs to
maintain the product almost always outweigh the costs to buy it new**.

Take my old Casio G-shock:

1. The resin strap and bezel has detoriated.
2. Although "solar powered", the battery has died.

The local Singapore casio service centre has quoted me in SGD:

- Bezel - $40
- Strap - $50
- Battery - $55
- Courier/Delivery service - $25

I.e. it costs 170SGD or ~125 USD to repair the watch back into working order.

I've seen the watch sell for as low as 40SGD used on https://www.carousell.sg/

The updated [Casio G-Shock GWM5610-1 Men's Solar Black Resin Sport Watch](https://www.amazon.sg/Casio-G-Shock-GWM5610-1-Solar-Black/dp/B007RWZHXO) sells for 115SGD **brand new**.

Comments?
[Reddit G-shock fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/gshock/comments/r75ayc/what_should_i_do_if_its_cheaper_to_buy_new_than/)
suggest I could the repair cheaper than the quoted repair price. I
don't think people value their time or expertise and the fact that I might
botch it!
