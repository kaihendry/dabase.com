tl;dr: Use TORX SCREWs, they break far less than fragile Pozidriv

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2025-08-26/pz2.jpeg" alt="screwdriver bits pack">

Why do they [sell packs of PZ2 screwdriver bits](https://www.screwfix.com/search?search=pz2+bit+pack)?

Because they break!

Do they sell packs of [Torx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Hexalobular_(Torx)) T20s bits? 

Now ask yourself why, and make your own conclusions why one is better than another.
