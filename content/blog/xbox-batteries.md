On the 18th of April 2024 I bought this rechargable batteries for [Xbox controllers from Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08Z5BG2P8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) with the hope of reducing the amount of waste we generate from disposable batteries.

Both batteries failed after 4 months. I am astonished.
