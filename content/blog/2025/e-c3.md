A Subcompact electric car I drove for a week in Italy, which when compared with a Tesla had the following shortcomings:

* No way to tell what the battery will be on arrival
* No route planner to take into account of charging stops
* The rental didn't include a EU plug charger, so you couldn't "granny charge" at your destination
* The charging door covers and charge lock were fiddly
* The Sixt app for charging was abysmal and expensive!

The Electroverse app was handy, but it didn't say what the charge was in progress!

# Tesla saves the day

Tesla should be commended for allowing non-Tesla cars to charge on their infrastructure:

</div>

It's cheap. It's reliable and unlike Electroverse app, it allows you see your charge progress!!
