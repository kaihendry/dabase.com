tl;dr Front left tyre punctured driving to London and to address the issue I ended up replacing both front tyres prematurely. The cost was ¬£588GBP and a lot of time & confusion.

# The puncture

At first I noticed an alert of 38PSI on the front left tyre [via the App](https://s.natalian.org/2025-03-07/deflating.png).

I later spotted the nail in the tyre.

# The fix

At first I tried Tesla service, but there was a 30 day wait. Then I tried roadside assistance.

I got an SMS, and the way I interepreted was that they would tow me and I would be required to pay 420GBP for the fix:

I didn't need a tow since it was a slow puncture, and I felt I could get a better deal than 420GBP!

# Third party

After ringing several tyre shops and going online I found two issues:

1. No one was prepared to repair the tyre, contrary to the advice of [Tesla Owners](https://teslaowners.org.uk/guides/can-my-tyre-be-repaired)
2. No one had the tyre in stock. They could get it in next day, but I could not wait.

# Tesla Owners UK

A member of the Tesla Owners UK group suggested I try [Just Tyres in Reading](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8ocVEDgTww9t5zgk8). I rang them up and they had them in stock! üçÄ They weren't prepared to repair the tyre due to the foam. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The owner said he had several Teslas in the shop that day. Doesn't surprise me since these [255/45R19 Hankook Ventus S1 EVO3 tyres](https://www.hankooktire.com/uk/en/tire/ventus/s1evo3ev.html) are specifically designed for the Model Y, and no one else has them in stock!

# Just Tyres

My aim was to repair the tyre, but both front tyres were on low tread. I mean, they had at least 6 months left in them.

Though the uncertainty of having one new tyre and one old tyre was too much for me. I decided to replace both front tyres.

Furthermore he recommended an alignment... and extra 50GBP. üí∏

# Conclusion

Tesla tyres are incredibly expensive. We need better options & repairability.
