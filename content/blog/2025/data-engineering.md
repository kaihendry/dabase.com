Before you can architect and deploy a data analytics system, the following questions must be answered:

* Which data should be analyzed? What is its value to the business or organization?
* Who owns the data? Where is it located?
* Is the data usable in its current state? What transformations are required?
* Who needs to see the data?
* After the data is curated and ready for consumption, how should it be presented?

Five steps:

1. Define Business value
2. Identify your data consumers
3. Identify your data sources
4. Define your data storage, catalog, and data access needs
5. Define your data processing requirements
