---

As a motorist, parking and potholes are my constant pain. ðŸ˜£

I've made a video of my [parking fine in Bodmin](https://youtu.be/x5Xd9N4Kyy4?si=pfy6-5gKSYcpW2g1), and I've [just learned](https://www.abundancepod.com/p/war-peace-car-parks-and-abundance) that the government cut funding to potential national solutions like the [National Parking Platform](https://npp.org.uk/).

As for potholes, there are LOT of them all over the UK and I'm surprised they exist. Doesn't anyone notice them and their potential to damage to property? Aren't there any technical scanning solutions to detect them?

# How to fix a pothole in Cornwall

ðŸ‘‰ [Report the hole's location with a photo upon this form](https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/transport-parking-and-streets/roads-highways-and-pavements/report-a-problem-with-a-road-or-pavement/report-a-pothole/)

If more people did this, there would be less potholes. ðŸ«µ

# My experiences so far

## Scarlets Well car park

I reported the potholes in a council run Car park (reference W252115854)

First I got a call from [Cormac](https://www.cormacltd.co.uk/) saying that this car park wasn't owned by anyone. The call came whilst I was already on a work call and I politely pointed out that this is impossible and that the council must own it since they lease spots for F&B and the like.

After a week, I was suprised to see the potholes were filled in. ðŸŽ‰

The odd thing is they never followed up to say it was fixed. You can look at the reference and it simply says "closed" with no way to offer feedback.

## Outside Cardinham school

There are a LOT of issues around the school. I reported one:

This time I got an email saying "We have now carried out works and have made the reported issue safe." and "Please do not reply to this email, as this mailbox is not monitored.".

Little bit unsatisfied with this repair and again no way to offer feedback.

# Conclusion

Modern Britain feels like a triumph to find the energy to **fill in cumbersome Web forms to get service delivery**. With a faceless impersonal response.

Which seems at odds with the [local council's vision](https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/media/sgtftgvc/medium-term-financial-plan-24-28.pdf) of:

> All supported by an empowering and enterprising Council that offers a consistently excellent customer experience and great value for money.
