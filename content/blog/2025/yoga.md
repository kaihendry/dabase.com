description: Stiff? Can't bend down? Yoga is what you need
---

Besides running & the [couch to 5k programme](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/get-active/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/), Yoga which I learned by attending Ashly Lou's aka "The Bitter Stickgirl" classes at Yoga Inc has been a positive impact in my wellbeing.

Now I feel comfortable in my skin. I have no problem bending down and I have the dexterity to play effectively with my kids!

# Tips to get started

## Mat

Yeah, you need a mat. If you're heavy, you need a thick mat or a (couple of) towels to get started to protect your knees!

Once you get into it, I highly recommend https://mandukauk.co.uk/ mats.

## A teacher

In Singapore, I loved [Jing's classes](https://yogainc.sg/teachers/). Now that I know the style of yoga I like (the no bullshit one), I'm pretty content just following https://www.youtube.com/@CharlieFollows videos online.

https://www.youtube.com/c/yogawithtim is also great.

# Minutes, every day

Yoga classes can be quite intemediating. Like everything in life, you need a system. What works for me is going a 10/15 minute morning Youtube session, pretty much every day.

At a pinch I might do a couple rounds of [Sun salutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Salutation).
