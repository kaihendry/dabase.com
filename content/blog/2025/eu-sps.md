Last [May 2025 the UK government hailed a new UK-EU aggreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-secures-new-agreement-with-eu-to-benefit-british-people), and I [wrongly assumed it removed Import Tax](/blog/2025/uk-tariffs/).

As it [explains](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukeu-summit-key-documentation/uk-eu-summit-explainer-html#sps-agreement), it's more to facilitate agri-food product trade without red tape.

It did mention [Erasmus](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukeu-summit-key-documentation/uk-eu-summit-explainer-html#youth-and-educational-mobility) which I was happy to see, since I've greatly benefitted from Erasmus.
