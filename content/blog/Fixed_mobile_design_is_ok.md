For years I've promoted liquid, fluid, scalable Web designs.

Designs that use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)">em</a>
instead of 12px in the style sheet. Those that used complicated floats, so that
when you resize the font the page still "looks good".

That's crap. I was wrong. Use fixed styles. Why? Because **page zooming** is
now the way good browsers scale a Web page. Safari on the iphone demonstrates
this really well.

Jeff Atwood argues well that browser should:

adopt full page zoom as the new default page sizing method
</blockquote>

And I whole heartedly agree.
