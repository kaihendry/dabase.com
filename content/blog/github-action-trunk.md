We focus on **trunk based development** on **main**, with a re-usuable Github workflow hiding the [details of the deployment](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/terraform-github-actions): 

```yaml
name: CI/CD 

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
    deploy-to-dev:
        name: Deploy to dev
        uses: ./.github/workflows/test.yml
        with:
            environment: dev

    deploy-to-stg:
        name: Deploy to stg
        needs:
            - deploy-to-dev
        uses: ./.github/workflows/test.yml
        with:
            environment: stg
```

Notice dev must succeed before staging (stg) can run. Ideally more tests form a safety net before we deploy to staging and production.

test.yml:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: The environment to run against
        type: string
        required: true

jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
      steps:
        - run: echo ${{ inputs.environment }}
        - run: echo ${{ vars.WORKLOAD }}
```

Notice WORKLOAD is set in the Github Action's environment.

# Approval for production

Use Github's environment **protection rules** to ensure we don't deploy to production without approval.
