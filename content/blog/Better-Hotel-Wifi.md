description: Working around a hotel's captive portal

I'm quarantined in a hotel for two weeks in Singapore and I don't want the
hassle of joining the open `JWMarriot` public network and logging in with my devices.

My solution is to connect a hap ac2 to the phone like so:

There was no address until I called reception and request their tech team
configures the port so that an address comes down like so:

Is the Mikrotik better?

Yes, my <abbr title="Wireless Access Point">AP</abbr> is on the table and ping times are halved with better stability
(no packetloss).

I work around the captive portal by only jumping hoops **once with the Mikrotik's MAC address**. Since it's consistently connected, it should not require a login again.ðŸ¤ž

So no need to jump hoops when I connect my devices, especially my
Archlinux machine which resists DNS poisoning on `portal.reivernet.com` !!
