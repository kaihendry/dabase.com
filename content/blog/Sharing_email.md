Say your business **@example.com** is interacting with a customer
**client@bank**. I've long lamented the need for [mailing list
archives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whogcE6bJ2o), but in practice:

# Office 365

A Group is created within Outlook

So for example it would be **bank@example.com** becomes to integration point.
In the Microsoft world, it feels a bit primitive, as the Group is just an
alias.

Pros:
* Simple

Cons:
* Needs to be made manually
* Usually it's done after a relationship has formed, losing the initial conversations.
* Customer must remember to use **bank@example.com** and not previous addresses
* When a new colleague joins, he/she won't be able to access conversions before he/she joined

To share a message in the past, what I've seen people do is create an **.eml**
attachment, which is horrible compared to a mailing archive URL. Most email
clients cannot open a **.eml** attachment except Outlook.

# Fastmail

[Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u11542869) has the ability to [share a
folder](https://www.fastmail.com/help/business/sharingmail.html), so you get
the ability to add someone to the folder, and that new person has context of
the previous correspondence.

In the past I've created a Sales folder and when sending emails it would be:

	From: hendry@example.com
	Reply-to: sales@example.com

You can conceivably split up folders and move mail between folders, so most of
the cons from **Office 365** are addressed.

However there are some cons like:

* Need to be wary of [folder permissions](https://www.fastmail.com/help/business/jmapfolderchanges.html)
* It's too easy for sales@example.com not to be CCed
* You don't know when a collegue is editing a reply
* You cannot share email by URL. You basically have to add someone to the folder and tell them some search criteria

# Gmail / Gsuite

[Use a group as a Collaborative
Inbox](https://support.google.com/a/answer/167430) appears to be Google's
answer to **shared mailboxes** with the added ability to tag, which appears
quite useful.

I have not tried it, so I don't know the nuances of the product.
