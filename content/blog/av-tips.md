Before we begin, unless you **record yourself**, you can't benchmark your
setup. Make recordings, **organise media** into YYYY-MM-DD folders and
scrutinise the A/V quality!

Use `ffprobe` from the <https://ffmpeg.org/> to work out the resolution of your recording btw.

# Network

Go wired!

Be wary of routes with PACKET LOSS [Exhibit A](https://smokeping.dabase.com/?target=Malaysia.TM) [Exhibit B](https://smokeping2.dabase.com/?target=Malaysia.TM) ... only really noticed with **constant monitoring**(!)

Good options for Apple <abbr title="Macbook Pros">MBP</abbr>:

- ~100SGD [Anker](https://www.lazada.sg/products/i377938838-s5140908513.html) with my [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D6cqMbeleI)
- ~30SGD [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32954358411.html)

# Lighting

- 42SGD [Ring light](https://www.carousell.sg/p/zomei-zm128-led-ring-light-3200k-5500k-camera-photo-dimmable-1001158668/) -- best for reducing face shadows
- 41SGD [Panel light](https://www.lazada.sg/products/free-stand-youtube-light-led-panel-mm-240-suitable-for-desktop-youtube-zoom-lighting-i1412992382.html) versus 200+SGD [key lights](https://www.lazada.sg/catalog/?q=elgato+light)

5600K colour temperature seems to be a sweet spot.

# Audio

Avoid wireless

- "Condensor microphone" (reduced pick up pattern) - 100SGD [Audio-Technica AT2005USB Cardioid Dynamic USB/XLR Microphone](https://amzn.to/37YFNVC)
- ~150SGD [Microphone boom](http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1)
- Advanced: Make a separate recording with for example a lapel microphone and an iPhone

# Video

- <abbr title="Network Device Interfac">NDI</abbr> Virtual Input - [use your iPhone](https://youtu.be/cX8fo74m6nc) at a pinch with some latency
- 1000SGD [Sony ZV-1](https://www.cathayphoto.com.sg/cameras/sony-zv-1-digital-camera) - can tether over USB
- A virtual background isn't a novelty

# Test your setup

1. Record yourself!
2. What could be be better? FOCUS ON AUDIO. Is there something distracting?
3. Go to step 1

Practice makes perfect.

# Next level stuff

The problem of "making eye contact" is quite difficult to solve if your camera isn't mounted on your screen

* Teleprompter / Glidecam is ~200SGD - you can mount a (small) HDMI output screen below it
* Try set you camera a few meters back from your desk, if you have the space

Green screen - less distracting than a virtual background

Pull up and under-the-bed storable

1. 5m x 2m  $189SGD
2. 3m x 2m $249SGD

Remember you only need to green screen your outline, not your back wall!

# Take aways - #priorities

1. Wired Network
2. Audio
3. Lighting

TODO: Watch some Zoom tutorial videos for [understanding some advanced features like Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW3U2Fv2CY8&feature=emb_title)
