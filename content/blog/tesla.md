# Covered car park

Teslas are not happy by default under the bright sun. They will activate Cabin
Overheat protection which will drain the battery.

If you do offer a garage, it needs to be on the larger side...

# A larger car park

Teslas demand a little more space, especially the Model Y, not just because
they are bigger, it's that one often needs to setup a thick charging cable.

Ideally the parking location is without foot traffic, to avoid people tripping
up on said cable, though also to avoid triggering **Sentry mode** which will
again drain the battery.

# Simple pricing on the destination charger

If you do offer charging, do please build the cost into the rental!

It's so bewildering to go to random destintations for them to tell you it costs
30GBP for minimum of three hours, and for every additional hour 10GBP there
after. You want us to enjoy the holiday when we have to account for that?!

Then add on complex idle costs?

A typical 7kw charger at a destination will very unlikely consume more than
20GBP of electricity in a day!

If you offer a destination charger, build the cost into the rental. Please make it
simple!

# Bonus points: Wifi

Teslas receive updates frequently, every month and wifi is needed.

Often parking spaces are not covered by Wifi access points. I encourage you to
install an outdoor AP like the [wAP
ac](https://mikrotik.com/product/wap_ac_be), else you can sometimes extend the
range temporarily using an Android device:
