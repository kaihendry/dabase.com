ยก[UPDATE 2021 November: Measuring serverless cold starts](/blog/2021/multi-cloud-serverless/)!

I've used https://github.com/kaihendry/count to <abbr title="Developer Experience">SX</abbr> managed
compute solutions <abbr title="also known as">aka</abbr> [Serverless
computing](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/).

AWS Fargate / Elastic Beanstalk is excluded because it does **not scale to
zero** since it requires an underlying compute cluster which you pay hourly
for.

<p><a id="immediate">[1]</a> CLI will say it's "done", though I suspect the Cloud is being <strong>eventually consistent</strong>... leading to some confusion when expected changes are not live!</p>
<p><a id="no-cli">[2]</a> No <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> / <abbr title="Infrastructure as Code">IaC</abbr> option <abbr title="As far as I can tell">AFAICT</abbr></p>

I've noticed deployment failures can happen when:
* [gcp-cloudrun when there is the same version](https://s.natalian.org/2021-01-05/same-version.png)
* [gcp-functions if it's already deploying](https://s.natalian.org/2021-01-05/deployment-failure.png)

[Apex Up](https://github.com/apex/up) is the clear winner to me. Apex Up has
the **fastest iterations** to the cloud (~2s), a fantastic <abbr
title="Developer Experience">DX</abbr> <abbr title="Command Line
Interface">CLI</abbr> with logging that's easy to use. Apex Up also
automatically bundles `static/` assets which the others don't do and uses the
[standard http request / response API](https://youtu.be/Bj2p6nVt_H4).

To experiment in further public clouds with managed compute, the [serverless
framework](https://www.serverless.com/) does seem to have the best starter
templates with `serverless create -h` to view them.

## Note about iteration speed

There are three types of iteration speed:

1. Local development speed, speed of live reloader like [entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/). Painful with functions that do not use HTTP req/res interface.
2. Using your serverless tooling to `time make deploy` and view changes on the Cloud endpoint.
3. Time for your CI/CD pipeline (Github action) to deploy (often much longer since env is setup from scratch)

Iteration speed above is **case 2**.

I do not consider the time for the initial setup / <abbr title="Infrastructure
as Code">IaC</abbr> provisioning which can take quite a bit of waiting,
especially for the **custom domain**!

# Price?!

Unfortunately it's quite tedious and difficult to compare the price, especially
when there is a free tier. Just know that I've not noticed an impact on my bill
when using serverless. It's must cheaper than paying hourly. If it becomes
expensive, you have options!
