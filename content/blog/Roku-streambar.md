description: Deplatformed Amazon review of the Roku Stream bar model 9102EU
---

I purchased the [Roku Streambar from
Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08JTTPHJ4/) for 99.99GBP on
the 7th June 2021 for my parents, delivered 10th of June. SKU #9102EU.

I contributed a review to Amazon but I somehow failed the [Amazon Community
Guidelines](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201929730&ref_=pe_1572281_66412641_cm_rv_rej_eml)
without naming which rule I violated.  ðŸ¤· Furthermore Amazon deleted my content
contribution. Thankfully they teased the beginning of the review in the
rejection email:

Now to recall what my review:

* ~40s to start watch BBC1 Live is quite a disappointing UX. I [complained to the BBC about the UX and they recommended {restart,update,reinstall} of the App](https://s.natalian.org/2021-06-14/bbc-iplayer.png) ... I think they missed the point.
* When you turn off the Roku whilst watching BBC1, you have to login from scratch, no quick resume. Agonising!
* No chromecast support surprisingly which makes Youtube quite painful
* Airplay is unstable as any other third party software (same experience as LG WebOS). If you enjoy Apple Airplay, my advice, you must buy an [Apple TV](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/)!
* The sound is good, but it's not as good as the SONOS for midrange sound / music. Voice is nice and clear.
* BBC looks better than it does over Freeview Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT), since it's in HD
* My parents Internet connection is via A&A and I have a subnet to ourselves. I.e. we don't use NAT, however the [Roku app doesn't work unless it's NATed](https://s.natalian.org/2021-06-14/no-nat.jpeg)!
* The [Samsung TV UE46C6500](https://s.natalian.org/2021-06-14/samsung.jpeg) that it's connected to doesn't support HDMI ARC, so I was very happy to see the included SPDIF audio cable... nice!
* The Roku remote control looks good at first, but then you have to **hold down the magnifying glass icon to do a voice search**?! WHAT? 
* The voice search is pretty hopeless
* The UI is definitely not intuitive from Home and I can't figure how to remap the icons

# Support

Roku support was disappointing. I wrote to Roku saying I followed their advice
upon https://support.roku.com/en-us/article/360017961074 and it doesn't work,
but they replied with a boilerplate response with ... the very same url
https://support.roku.com/en-us/article/360017961074 ðŸ¤¦

Earlier I (innocently) asked
[/r/roku](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/nu5fu1/zdf_german_television_will_it_work_from_the_uk/)
about watching German TV and I got banned for 15 days. Bit disappointing...

Later I found out about https://www.youtv.de/produkte so I am looking into that
to watch German TV instead of receiving satellite television via Astra 1M.

# Conclusion

As a technologist, I am underwhelmed / depressed about IP TV. For my parents,
it allows them to watch BBC Iplayer in the kitchen with better sound, so
they're happy.
