LAN gaming with my kids upon Minecraft has been like a death by a thousand
cuts.

Despite running my own Bedrock server `docker run -d -it --name bds-survival -e EULA=TRUE -e GAMEMODE=survival -p 19132:19132/udp itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server`, each client now **needs to sign into a Microsoft account** in order to play.

{{< tweet 1438797861836132354 >}}

You can't share a Microsoft account, you'll get a "Cannot join world. The
account you are signed in to is currently playing in this world on a different
device."

It's extra painful when each client has further requirements:

* <abbr title="PlayStation 4">PS4</abbr> client requires an account and a **PlayStation Plus** subscription AND me to purchase Minecraft
* Our other client is the iPad, which of course requires an Apple account and a [purchase of Minecraft](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft/id479516143) which is shared via my family account from my account to my son's Apple ID

I wonder if it's the same nonsense on the Java client. Though I doubt we
realistically switch since I don't know how to replace the PS4 attached to the
TV nor the Ipad.

It feels a little insane to create an Apple ID for my five year old, let alone
a Microsoft account.
