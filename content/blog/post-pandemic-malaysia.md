description: Observations from a August 2022 trip

Singapore has been my home during the COVID-19 pandemic and though we are
almost "back to normal" in August 2022, there are lingering changes I've
observed which are also amplified in my previous home; Malaysia.

# Lack of manpower

It's harder to book a Grab taxi. It's almost impossible to go out for a late
night drink.

For example my Malaysian stomping grounds is the Uptown area of Demansara
Utama, and it's dead from 9PM now.

# Everyone in Malaysia wears masks

Everyone complies to where a mask in Malaysia. Even outside!

# Insurance coverage differences

In Singapore, one felt confident that if you had COVID complications,
Singapore's medical system has you covered with it's high quality government
hospitals and private ones.

I've learned that private hospitals in Malaysia which I would rely on if I
lived here, typically **rejected COVID19 patients** for two reasons:

1. They would be afraid the patient would infect the ward
2. COVID19 was typically not covered by insurance!!

This would explain Malaysia's high COVID death rate of ~1140 per million versus
Singapore's 274.

# Saliva based tests

Malaysian tests are saliva based, not nasal sticks like you find in Singapore.
