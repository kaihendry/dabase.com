Some nice tips from AWS Support Engineer Reyaad:

> There is no native screen-sharing software from AWS besides
> [chime](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/getting-started/). However, chime requires
> configuration and there are plenty of third-party solutions that provide a
> quick screensharing session for a support engineer. I can vouch for the
> following:

1. [Anydesk](https://anydesk.com/)
2. [Nomachine](https://www.nomachine.com/)
3. [Chrome remote desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/?pli=1)
4. [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen)
5. [Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/)
