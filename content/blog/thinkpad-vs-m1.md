# Price

* Bought 20-05-2021 13-inch MacBook Air - 512GB 8GB RAM - 1690SGD (16GB RAM wasn't in stock and I didn't want to wait)
* Bought 29-08-2020 [Thinkpad T14s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihFPynCqfzc&list=PLiKgVPlhUNuy_AnTdTxCVGsMgidyGuCcQ) (20UHS01400) - 1662SGD (inc a 135SGD ThinkPad USB-C Dock Gen 2)

The Lenovo buying experience was awful.

# Keyboard / Mouse

About the same actually.

The M1 Trackpad is far superior. I need an external mouse with the Thinkpad.

# Suspend

* M1 is blazing fast, like faster than you can open the lid! Like a mobile phone?
* Thinkpad is also pretty good. 

# CPU

I was impressed by the Ryzen oompf, but tbh I was not super satisfied with
Video acceleration.

M1 feels very fast.

# Battery

* M1 wins - it can easily last all day
* Thinkpad lasts enough

# Screen

* M1 wins 2650x1600
* Thinkpad has a sad 1920x1080 screen

# Microphone / Camera / Speakers

T14s microphone is unusable. So is the camera. Speakers are better than I
remember previous Thinkpads had, but still woeful compared to the MBA M1.

# Ram

* M1 has 8GB fixed. It manage to make it panic on not enough memory, enough to close an app.
* Thinkpad has 16GB also fixed (soldered on)

# Heat

Admittedly the T14s would get hot on challenging workloads, like playing games.
But under normal browser + terminal workloads, I found it fine. Though it was easy to put it over the edge... perhaps by running Slack. :/

M1 wins. It doesn't even have a fan. You can actually use this laptop **on your lap**.

# Ports

Both have two USB-C ports. T14s has two extra USB-As. Win for Thinkpad!

# Software

M1 run MacOS and FCPX / Safari are beautifully optimised for it.

T14s can run any OS, and I've chosen Archlinux btw.

Fans of Apple Silicon are working to port Linux to it: <https://asahilinux.org/> ... it's not there yet

# Conclusion

{{< youtube c4QpF9EjaGY >}}

Despite the M1's hardware being amazing, I just hate brew over pacman/yay. I hate the MacOS window manager. I hate the xcode nonsense. I hate not being in control of the software.

Would I install Linux if I could? Probably not. I actually like to see what's
going on in MacOS, and to importantly user Photos and FCPX, which I am sadly
reliant upon for my pictures and videos!

So what's your next Linux laptop? idk. Not Apple hardware.
