# My choice?

As a builder I prefer the <abbr title="ThinkPad T14 Gen 3">T14G3</abbr> since it runs
Archlinux and I like to use the <a href="https://suckless.org/">"Suckless desktop"</a>, the dynamic tiling window
manager [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) running on Xorg. Is Xorg better than MacOS? No. I choose it because it's more open and developer friendly.

I enjoy the piece of mind of having pretty much full control of my Thinkpad.

Would I choose the Lenovo hardware over the Apple hardware? No, a bigger NO if it was running spyware like Windows.

I consciously choose the more open PC hardware since I want to see a more open computing ecosystem.

# Why the M2?

It's actually my wife's. I recommend Apple to friends and family members who aren't geeks like myself.

I do use the M2 for [editing my videos](https://www.youtube.com/kaihendry). If I travel I would take this laptop. It's easier to recover from. I get a break from my "developer focused" Thinkpad.
