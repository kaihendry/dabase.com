This is not an atypical payment request from an enrichment class:

What could be better here?

1. Due date could be better advertised
2. No way to quickly pay the invoice via a link that includes a reference. [1]
3. Total includes late fee. Am I already late? Huh?
4. No way of me knowing if I have already paid this amount (assuming I forgot the next step)
5. Expects a reply telling them the date of the transfer


# [1] Paynow with a reference?!

Good for you and the vendor to have a hopefully unique way to identify what you
paid for.

This in an ideal world would be part of the Paynow QR code. I enquired about
getting a reference embedded in the payment and perhaps a Webhook (so the
vendor knows the invoice was paid) and this is the reply from DBS:

> For API solution, as this is a premium solutioning there will be an initial

> the API solution.  Transaction cost via API will be advised further by the
> relevant team as it differs from product to product.
