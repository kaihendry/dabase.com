<sup>1</sup> [Apple can read your backups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwbFlUldZ0U)

<sup>2</sup> You can just replace your device by restoring your backup, so moot

<sup>3</sup> Bypassed trivially with the 6 digit PIN password

<sup>4</sup> If lost (forgotten), I basically lose my private data. No chance of recovery. Private data includes my accounts file and various recovery codes.

<sup>5</sup> Authy IIUC can be completely recovered by knowing my Authy **password**. I could enable Face ID protection, but again IIUC it could be trivially bypassed with PIN. I think the keys are stored in my Apple account, tbh I am not sure.

# Things I'm struggling with

I've since delegated my [vimcrypt accounts
file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcdan1UD-0) mostly to [Firefox
accounts](https://s.natalian.org/2020-10-04/1601824182_1920x1080.png), and over
time, my local passwords are becoming out of date, since they are being managed
by Firefox.

I struggle to maintain which accounts I have 2FA with. I struggle to keep track
of what App passwords are being used by my mobile for example and if they
should be rotated. RE 2FA I struggle to maintain the recovery codes.

I don't think I use biometric meaningfully anywhere. Face ID is just a
convenience functionality on Apple IOS to save typing in a password?

I think my setup is too complex for any trusted member of my family (or friend)
to recover my data with, in case of an accident.

# Things I think I'm doing well with

I try not to use my Singapore number for anything, but some services esp like
banks in Singapore force me to use it.
