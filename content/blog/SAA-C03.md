# RDS Proxy

> RDS Proxy establishes and manages the necessary connection
> pools to your database so that your application creates fewer
> database connections.

# AWS Backup

> In AWS Backup, a backup vault is a container that stores and organizes
> your backups.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vaults.html

# AWS DataSync (AMS SSPS)

> AWS DataSync moves large amounts of data online between on-premises
> storage and Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon Elastic File
> System) or Amazon FSx.

</a>

> DataSync software agent connects to your Network File System (NFS) and
> Server Message Block (SMB) storage, so you donâ€™t have to modify your
> applications

# Deny access based on source IP address "NotIpAddress"

Comees under [AWS global condition context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html).

> Be careful using negative conditions in the same policy statement as
> "Effect": "Deny". When you do, the actions specified in the policy statement
> are explicitly denied in all conditions except for the ones specified.

# Amazon Aurora Global Database

* <abbr title="Recovery Point Objective">RPO</abbr> is < 1 second
* <abbr title="Recovery Time Objective">RTO</abbr> is one minute

> Amazon Aurora Global Database is designed for globally distributed
> applications, allowing a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS
> Regions. It replicates your data with no impact on database performance,
> enables fast local reads with low latency in each Region, and provides
> disaster recovery from Region-wide outages.

# Lambda

Offers <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html">resource-based policies</a>

> Lambda supports resource-based permissions policies for Lambda functions and
> layers. Resource-based policies let you grant usage permission to other AWS
> accounts or organizations on a per-resource basis. You also use a
> resource-based policy to allow an AWS service to invoke your function on your
> behalf.

# Amazon FSx for Lustre

* High performance
* Fast processing
* Parallel filesystem

# AWS S3 Compliance types

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html

S3 Object Lock provides two retention modes:

1. **Governance mode** - users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions; `x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true` header and **s3:BypassGovernanceRetention**
2. **Compliance mode**

> In compliance mode, a protected object version can't be overwritten or
> deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account. When an
> object is locked in compliance mode, its retention mode can't be changed, and
> its retention period can't be shortened. Compliance mode helps ensure that an
> object version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the
> retention period.



# Notes

Security Groups are on the instance level, not the subnet level.

AWS S3 Glacier instant retrieval for **rare cases**.

AWS Guard Duty offers continuous monitoring.

Backup + Restore strategy is the cheapest backup strategy. Next level is Pilot Light.

<abbr title="Amazon Simple Queue Service">SQS</abbr> not guaranteed to preserve order by default. Kinesis preserves ordering.

<abbr title="Web Application Firewall">WAF</abbr> is for Layer 7, AWS Network Firewall provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/faqs/#product-faqs#network-firewall-faqs#general">"control and visibility to Layer 3-7 network traffic for your entire VPC"</a>.

Managing cross account resources? You need:
1. Organisations
2. AWS <abbr title="Resource Access Manager">RAM</abbr>

AWS Volume Gateway = SCSI

Compliance = [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/)

Cloudwatch Events = Amazon Eventbridge

EC2 Health Check fail should mean a reboot (that also keeps the resources in tact)

EC2 stopped = resources reallocated

[Firewall manager to centrally manage rules](https://aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager/)

AWS Shield (by default), AWS Shield Advanced = Extra
