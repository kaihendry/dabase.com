Prompted by [Rehan van der Merwe](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rehan-van-der-merwe-600b40172_9-slack-tips-to-1-click-on-the-little-activity-6922430290078351360-M46f?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) and my [plea video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUpghvOCwhc).

Proposals to make Slack better at workplaces:

## Tag to the relevant team member

If you don't tag the team member you cannot expect that team member to read it.

## Disable conversation / threads, they often hide content

Practiced notably by [Gophers Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T029RQSE6/C029RQSEE)

On the other hand... some people love threads and swear by them. ðŸ¤·

## Limit amount of channels

More channels is more difficult to navigate to between and as a consequence
this hides content.

## Prioritise by Stars

If you are working across teams, **star something if I still need to do
something with it**. That way you'll get a clean side bar.

## Use the reminder function to avoid forgetting to respond

Typically one can use both the bookmark and reminder function to not miss an
important message or question.

## Bookmark across teams

Instead of bookmarking, you could Copy link of important messages and DM
yourself and build up a list of important messsages which you can share on your
team's wiki.

## Say "bye"

One gigantic problem with Slack is disconnecting from work. Establish a **Way
of working** with your team, clock off by saying "bye" at end of the working
day.

You can set your slack work hours, it will put the ðŸ’¤ icon next to your name
if you are offline.

## Use huddles

Frictionless quick conversation and share your screen via huddle.

## Record a video clip

If you need to show something, instead of calling for a huddle and a screen
share, take a short video of the issue!
