Prompted by [Rehan van der Merwe](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rehan-van-der-merwe-600b40172_9-slack-tips-to-1-click-on-the-little-activity-6922430290078351360-M46f?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) and my [plea video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUpghvOCwhc).

Proposals to make Slack better at workplaces:

## Tag @mention the relevant team member

If you don't tag the team member you cannot expect that team member to read it.

## Limit amount of channels

More channels is more difficult to navigate to between and as a consequence
this hides content.

## Prioritise by Stars

If you are working across teams, **star something if I still need to do
something with it**. That way you'll get a clean side bar.

## Use the reminder function to remind yourself to respond

Typically one can use both the bookmark and reminder function to not miss an
important message or question.

## Bookmark across teams using Pins

Instead of bookmarking, you can Pin important messages.

## Say "bye"

One gigantic problem with Slack is disconnecting from work. Establish a **Way
of working** with your team. For example a simple gesture of saying "bye" at
end of the working day can help.

## Focus time

You can set your slack work hours, it will put the 💤 icon next to your name
if you are offline.

## Use huddles

Frictionless quick conversation and share your screen via huddle.

You don't need Zoom or Google Meet.

## Record a video clip

If you need to show something, instead of calling for a huddle and a screen
share, take a short video of the issue!

A video can be worth a 1000 words if you are reporting a bug for example that
relates to UX. It also avoids wasting time, since you can retake the video to
make sure it communicates your intent.

## Organise channels

Group and organize your channels in the menu by category (called sections), you
can even place an icon next to each category.

## Foster a positive culture

Inspired by https://www.heytaco.chat/ for driving team building.

Some workspaces make Friday a half day and make it a point to recognise the
past week's worth of work with some "shout outs" and fun.
