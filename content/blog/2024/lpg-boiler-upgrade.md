Our Baxi 428 LPG Combi chews through 47kg LPG gas bottles on a weekly basis
during winter that cost us about 88GBP:

# OpenTherm

We are interesting in OpenTherm, since the current system is just on/off until
it reaches the desired temperature where the control sits:

Ideally it also plays nice with Home Assistant.

# Heat pump

We are also keen on heat pump technology, especially the new [R290
variants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKnNLp3ptDQ). This is for our
[cottage](https://www.prazefarm.co.uk/cottage/) which is not grade 2 listed,
unlike the main house.
