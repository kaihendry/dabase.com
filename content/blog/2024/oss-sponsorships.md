description: Why sponsoring OSS is hard
---


There are too many <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> tools that a
typical company uses. It's not feasible to sponsor all of them.

It's impossible to do this responsibly or fairly.

Could instead bring attention to projects an organisation uses. Equivalent to
"exposure bucks" in the design world.

Could we instead sponsor our time to a project we use and account for that in
our time tracking?

Perhaps consider https://www.oss.fund/ as a way to find projects to sponsor.

Too much logistics to figure out how to contribute back.

Many projects like [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) rely on lima
and qemu and so on and on. No one knows how to distribute the money across
layers of dependencies.
