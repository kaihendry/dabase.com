description: What TV for Mac Mini?
---

The compact and affordable M4 Mac Mini looks great, but I need to find a display to plug it into. I'm considering a TV, but I'm not sure if it's the best option.

Features the TV needs:

* 4K at 60Hz
* Viewable at 2m distance (ideally further!)
* Legible text
* HDMI auto switch on AND OFF
* Be able to do tasks like FCPX editing, Keynote presentations, and web browsing
