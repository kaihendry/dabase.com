description: How mobile device management can work from a VPN client
---

I have `aur/globalprotect-openconnect` installed to access my employer's VPN.

However it's not clear that the MacOS version installs [Microsoft
Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune),
which basically is able to do anything on your system.

Now you know that a <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> is a gateway to <abbr title="Mobile device management">MDM</abbr> aka remote administration.
