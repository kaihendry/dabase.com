# Rule 1

## Have a URL that addresses the issue as clearly as possible.

Every time I see help documents that has something like: Menu &rarr; Settings
&rarr; Advanced Settings &rarr; Network &rarr; Add, I **cringe**.

The URL should be something like https://example.com/settings/network/add.
Plain and simple. Firefox is terrible at this and Chrome's are much better with
items like __chrome://settings/certificates__, but many of them are inconsistent
and not used from their own [awful accordion style
documentation](https://support.google.com/chrome/), which goes on to break
**Rule 2**.

Other times, I have a particular question and I can only find an answer perhaps
on an outdated forum. The service I am dealing with, should have the canonical
answer on a [[FAQ that does not suck|How to create a FAQ that does not suck]].
E.g. Does Webconverger support touch screens? Here have a look at:
<http://webconverger.com/faq/#does-webconverger-support-touch-screens>.

# Rule 2

## Make the site Ctrl+F-able

One of my learnings about how people use <http://greptweet.com/> is that people
prefer Ctrl+F instead of actually using the search box.

Chrome's Ctrl+F is fast, gives great highlight indicators to matched word,
number of matches and where they are in the document by markers on the
scrollbar.

The very worse example I've found is Paypal's new 2014 UI refresh. Settings are
[hidden behind an icon of a
head](http://s.natalian.org/2015-03-04/topright.png).
