# If an Electric Vehicle consumes 263 Wh/mi, and the cost of a kw/h is 20 pence, how much does it cost to drive 1 mile?

To find the cost of driving 1 mile:

1. Convert the consumption to kWh/mi:
263 Wh/mi = 0.263 kWh/mi

2. Multiply the consumption per mile by the cost per kWh:
0.263 kWh/mi × 20 pence/kWh

= 5.26 pence/mi

So, it costs 5.26 pence to drive 1 mile in that Electric Vehicle given the specified consumption and energy cost.

# If the cost per litre of fuel is 150p, and a typical gasoline car has about 36 MPG, how much does it cost to drive one mile?

To determine the cost of driving one mile in a gasoline car with an efficiency of 36 MPG:

1. Find out how much fuel is used for 1 mile:
1 mile/36 miles = 0.0278 gallons (or litres in this context since MPG and fuel cost is being measured in the UK context)

2. Calculate the cost to drive one mile:
0.0278 litres × 150p/litre = 4.17 pence

So, with the given fuel price and efficiency, it costs approximately 4.17 pence to drive one mile in the gasoline car.
