# If an Electric Vehicle consumes 263 Wh/mi, and the cost of a kw/h is 20 pence, how much does it cost to drive 1 mile?

To find the cost of driving 1 mile:

1. Convert the consumption to kWh/mi:
263 Wh/mi = 0.263 kWh/mi

2. Multiply the consumption per mile by the cost per kWh:
0.263 kWh/mi × 20 pence/kWh

= 5.26 pence/mi

So, it costs 5.26 pence to drive 1 mile in that Electric Vehicle given the specified consumption and energy cost.

# If the cost per litre of fuel is 150p, and a typical gasoline car has about 36 MPG, how much does it cost to drive one mile?

Convert the fuel efficiency from MPG to MPL (miles per litre):
36 miles/4.54609 litres = 7.92 miles/litre

Find out how much fuel is used for 1 mile:
1 mile/7.92 miles/litre = 0.1263 litres

Calculate the cost to drive one mile:
0.1263 litres × 150p/litre = 18.945 pence


# Conclusion

As of August 2023, it's almost **four times cheaper to drive a mile in an electric vehicle** than a gasoline vehicle.

Lets not forget the other benefits of electric vehicles, such as:
* cleaner air
* less noise pollution
* less maintenance
* cleaner over time as the [electricity grid becomes greener](https://grid.iamkate.com/)
