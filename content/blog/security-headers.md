Dubious sites like "securityheaders.com" will give you a big fat F without a whole bunch of headers.

# Adding headers on AWS

tl;dr a PITA -- from AWS Support

Custom response headers is not a native feature built into CloudFront at the
time writing, which means that you need to rely on a feature or service that
allows arbitrary modifications to responses. Currently, this is only allowed by
Lambda@edge or CloudFront functions.

The latter is a recently introduced alternative to Lambda@edge with lower
pricing that allows basic transformations to your requests or responses using
Javascript, and they can only be triggered at viewer requests and responses.
Therefore, if Lambda@edge pricing is your concern, you may write and attach a
CloudFront function triggered at viewer response to achieve this use case.

There are differences in CloudFront functions' event structure[1] and the
accepted function signature[2], please review the documentation links and
examples[3] for more information. Pricing information is available on the main
pricing page[4].
