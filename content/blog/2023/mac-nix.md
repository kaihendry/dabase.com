No idea what's getting updated

Build takes ages

Stuggling to get an editor that can edit .nix

Nixpkgs doesn't have Maccy and other tools I need, so homebrew is still there

Keyboard sensitivity hack is almost worth the trouble alone

/etc/shells makes it obscenely difficult to choose the bash shell over zsh

I needed to rollback, but couldn't figure out how to - dx
