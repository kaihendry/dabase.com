description: Shortfalls I noticed whilst cooking up a Go program to consume some JSON endpoints
---

Whilst coding up a utility to piece together some JSON API responses I ran into a couple of issues:

# JSON to struct

1. How do you convert JSON to Go Structs without https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/ locally in the editor?
2. Perhaps you need to select part of the struct as a standalone type, moving it out in vscode with its json tags is quite tedious

# Curl to struct

The boiler plate needed to convert curl commands to go is tedious and copilot is of no help.

https://mholt.github.io/curl-to-go/ helps, though it misses out on resp.StatusCode checks.

    err = json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&pc)

Furthermore Copilot doesn't seem to be smart enough to use json.NewDecoder instead of json.Unmarshal

# General JSON pain

    json: cannot unmarshal number into Go struct field

Errors like the above make me think twice about using Golang to parse JSON. It's a total pain to implement a custom UnmarshalJSON method or do typecasting!
