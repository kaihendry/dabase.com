Two problems:

1. Cracked front screen
2. 80% battery health

# Is it worth the repair?

Typical second hand price for an iPhone Xs is [150GBP](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=iphone+Xs&_sacat=0&Model=Apple%2520iPhone%2520XS&Network=Unlocked&LH_ItemCondition=3000&rt=nc&Storage%2520Capacity=256%2520GB&_dcat=9355) in 2023.

374GBP for a official Apple repair a phone worth 150GBP, that's not worth it. Unless there is a more competitive repair service in the UK?
