description: Makefiles are the entry point to every software project

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> is a software tool older than myself that new developers might over look, as being old and irrelevant.

The Makefile language requires tabs and that already causes new users to abandon it.

However there are some **good reasons to know basic Make**:

1. It's the entrypoint for millions of software projects
2. It's fast
3. It describes how the software is built!
