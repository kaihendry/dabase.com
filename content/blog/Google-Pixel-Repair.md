The 499SGD [Pixel 4a](https://youtu.be/qAta8gtaBoc) (128 GB, Just Black, Unlocked) and 60SGD Pixel 4a Fabric
Case (Blue Confetti) was dropped by my busy helper, resulting in the screen
being cracked:

If you crack your iPhone 6/7 screen in down town Singapore, you should be able
to repair the device in **about an hour of the accident for 80SGD** from a
variety of after market [vendors](https://mobyshop.com.sg/).

# Pixel repair Singapore

Through a pointless 30 minute Google Chat were I needed to type in several IMEI
numbers, I found only one [Pixel repair vendor in Singapore called
CTDi](https://support.google.com/store/answer/7182296).

CTDi charge **128SGD** for a screen replacement and it takes 1 Business day to
process the repair. So you would need to visit their office in Aperia Mall to
submit and collect it.

How much is your time worth?

# Ifixit

There is no [screen replacement
kit](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_4a) available upon iFixit as
yet.
