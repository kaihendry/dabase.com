I purchased [Panasonic Eneloop Rechargeable
Batteries](https://www.amazon.sg/gp/product/B0725HYSF8?th=1) for my Xbox
controllers without knowing that [Xbox Series S cannot actually charge rechargable
batteries](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSupport/comments/tdtww3/controller_not_charging/), like the Playstation DS4 controller can! :(

I since bought the [LIITOKALA
LII-M4](https://www.lazada.sg/products/i1942835005-s10399942279.html) to charge
the four **Eneloop Ni-MH High Capacity rechargeable batteries**.

It outputs:

- Li-Ion 4.20V 500mA\*4 or 1000 mA\*2 (charges two batteries faster than one?)
- Ni-Mh/Cd: 1.48V 500mA\*4

[Lithium Ion batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery) can be found in my Iphone, but my AA batteries are a different technology,
[Nickel–metal hydride batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery).
