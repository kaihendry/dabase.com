description: Attempt to repair a Macbook Air M2 that only shows a cursor on the black screen

My wife's Macbook Air M2, Model A2681, bought on 2022-07-08 for 2149SGD,
suddenly stopped working. When you turn it on, it shows a black screen with a
cursor. The cursor moves when you move the trackpad, but nothing else happens.
The keyboard is unresponsive, and the screen remains black.

According to https://checkcoverage.apple.com/coverage the "Coverage Expired".

We tried the [How to revive or restore Mac firmware
](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255) instructions from Apple, but it
still exhibits the same issue.
