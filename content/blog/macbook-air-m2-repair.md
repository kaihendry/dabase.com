My wife's Macbook Air M2, Model A2681, bought on 2022-07-08 for 2149SGD, failed to come out of suspend on the 2024-04-24. When you turn it on,
it shows a black screen with a cursor. The cursor moves when you move the
trackpad, but nothing else happens. The keyboard is unresponsive, and the
screen remains black.

According to https://checkcoverage.apple.com/coverage the "Coverage Expired".
Bit dissapointing to have less than two years warranty.

# Attempt to repair via <abbr title="Device Firmware Update">DFU</abbr> mode

This took a while to figure out, and needed a working Mac to do so!

We accomplished the [How to revive or restore Mac firmware
](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255) instructions from Apple, but it
still exhibits the same issue.

# Attempt to repair via technician appointment

Via the [Web chat service](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions/chat/confirmation) we opened a case and booked an appointment at the Apple Store in Plymouth Saturday, 27 April, 11:20.

The technician at the Apple Store in Plymouth, UK, diagnosed the issue as a faulty screen.

The repair cost was 550GBP, but thankfully since the device was less than two years old, it was covered under warranty.

Worryingly the trade in value for the pristine device is 655GBP!

We had to leave the device that Saturday and it was ready for collection on the following Tuesday.

# Conclusion

Overall I am satisified with the good service and repair. Hate to think of what Lenovo would do.

However two things bothered me about this repair:

1. The hard drive is soldered onto the motherboard, so if the motherboard fails, you lose all your data. If they needed to replace the motherboard, we would have lost all our data.
2. The black screen was a cursor issue. The technician said that it didn't work with an external monitor because I didn't set it to mirror mode. However when the screen was fixed, it worked fine with an external monitor.
