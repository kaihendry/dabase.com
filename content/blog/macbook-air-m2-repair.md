description: Attempt to repair a Macbook Air M2 that only shows a cursor on the black screen
---

My wife's Macbook Air M2, Model A2681, bought on 2022-07-08 for 2149SGD,
suddenly failed to come out of suspend on the 2024-04-24. When you turn it on,
it shows a black screen with a cursor. The cursor moves when you move the
trackpad, but nothing else happens. The keyboard is unresponsive, and the
screen remains black.

According to https://checkcoverage.apple.com/coverage the "Coverage Expired".
Bit dissapointing to have less than two years warranty.

# Attempt to repair via <abbr title="Device Firmware Update">DFU</abbr> mode

This took a while to figure out, and needed a working Mac to do so!

We accomplished the [How to revive or restore Mac firmware
](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255) instructions from Apple, but it
still exhibits the same issue.

# Attempt to repair via technician appointment

Via the [Web chat service](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions/chat/confirmation) we opened a case and booked an appointment at the Apple Store in Plymouth Saturday, 27 April, 11:20.
