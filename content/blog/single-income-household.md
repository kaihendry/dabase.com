Imagine a single professional earning 80k GBP a year.

[Weekly net wage](https://listentotaxman.com/?year=2024&taxregion=uk&age=0&time=1&ingr=80000) is 1095GBP.

Now that person is married, but the spouse is a stay at home parent. [Weekly net wage](https://listentotaxman.com/?year=2024&taxregion=uk&married=true&marriageallowance=true&age=0&time=1&ingr=80000) is exactly the same at 1095GBP!

Now lets say that person works really hard and could get a job earning 50% / 40k more, bringing their annual income to 120k.

[Weekly net wage](https://listentotaxman.com/?year=2024&taxregion=uk&married=true&marriageallowance=true&age=0&time=1&ingr=80000) is 1464GBP, that's an increase of 369GBP a week, or in percentage terms, 33.7% more.

Lets consider the scenario where the wife instead joins the workforce and puts the children in daycare. The wife earns 40k.

* His weekly net wage is 1095GBP with an 80k salary
* [Her weekly net wage is 626GBP with a 40k salary](https://listentotaxman.com/?year=2024&taxregion=uk&married=true&marriageallowance=true&age=0&time=1&ingr=40000)

Together their weekly net wage is 1721GBP, which is 257GBP better off a week than the single income household on a 120k annual salary. 

In percentage terms, that's 17.6% more of an incentive to have a dual income household and put children in daycare.
