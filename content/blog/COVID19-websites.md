Thanks to a prod by the [esteemed
@cheeuan](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/1232658527572774912), I am
collecting country specific Websites that communicate the ["Wuhan" Coronavirus
Outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_outbreak) to their local populace.

I'm using 👮 to indicate the site I believe to be an official respective
government site. Not easy to tell sometimes.

My goal is to capture the nuances in the information delivery between each
country.

# Singapore 🇸🇬

* 👮 https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7e30edc490a5441a874f9efe67bd8b89

# Japan 🇯🇵

* https://japan-cov-19.now.sh/

# Korea 🇰🇷

* 👮 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030
