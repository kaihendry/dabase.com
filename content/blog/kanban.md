description: Keeping things simple with Kanban

Kanban is an agile project management style I prefer to use in teams since it
is simple, though you need to be mindful of the following:

Cards (aka issues aka tickets) need to be small and manageable.

Cards should be based on value, not tasks for a specific person.

# Implementing Kanban in Jira

Configure the board, Card layout, and put "days in column" to see highlight
older cards.

Add "width limits" (aka <abbr title="Work in Progress">WIP</abbr> limits) on the columns to encourage collaboration and moving cards
across the board.

# Typical ceremonies in Kanban

Pairing / mobbing to encourage collaboration.

1. Refinement: Review the backlog and add new cards.
2. Showcase: Demonstrate value delivered.
3. Retrospective: Reflect on the process and improve.

# Story templates

Don't forget to formulate a definition of done, perhaps in a team's **Ways of
Working** document.

    h2. Context

    h2. Story

    * AS A <role>
    * I WANT  <observable change>
    * SO THAT <valuable outcome>

     h2. Scope

    * IN
    * OUT

    h2.  Acceptance Criteria

    * GIVEN
    * WHEN
    * THEN

# Summary

Focus on aging work, before starting any new work. This encourages collaboration
and helps to deliver value faster.
