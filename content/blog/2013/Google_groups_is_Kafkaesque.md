There are plenty of [Google Groups rants](http://ejohn.org/blog/google-groups-is-dead/) out there, here is mine:

* 99% of SPAM is Chinese, Non-English and non-primary language as I've configured the group. Still it comes.
* The buttons to "Report Spam" and to let the Spam through and subsequent spams are NIGHTMARISHLY close together

There is NO WAY to give Google Groups admins feedback. WTF?!

The seemingly only way to offer feedback is to become a [Google Top
contributor](http://www.google.com/get/topcontributor/)... no thanks.


And it's so [hard to migrate away from Google services](http://natalian.org/archives/2013/08/22/Gmail_to_Fastmail/). <http://www.dataliberation.org/> is a sick joke.
