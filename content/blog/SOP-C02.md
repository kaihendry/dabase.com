description: Studying for AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional
---

Three years have passed since certifying the rather painful
[SAP-C01](https://dabase.com/blog/2020/AWS_Pro_exam_notes/) on my _second try_.
My certification has since expired and I thought lets challenge myself to <abbr
title="Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional">DOP-C02</abbr>.

* [X] Block time in Calendar
* [X] Buy the exam slot
* [X] Arrange learning resource (videos)
* [X] Practice Exam

I've given myself a solid week to prepare since I'm not assigned to a client
project. Confident by the fact I re-certified
[SAA-C03](https://www.credly.com/users/khendry/badges) & obtained a 50% exam discount last week and with my [SAA-C03 learning notes](/blog/2023/SAA-C03/) that helped me pass
first time.

Furthermore:

Lets checkout what [Reddit has to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/search?q=DOP-C02&restrict_sr=on).

* READ THE QUESTION Cost effective/low overhead/operational efficiency parameters will shape the answer.
* KNOW THE CODE* suite
* When in doubt, the answer is either Config or EventBridge

Bought the 96USD [@adriancantrill](https://twitter.com/adriancantrill) course https://learn.cantrill.io/, since it came recommended on Reddit:

And of course I bought <abbr title="Tutorial Dojo">TD</abbr> Jon-Bonso's Practice Exams:

I also have access to https://learn.acloud.guru/search?query=DOP-C02&page=1 which I will use too.

# Learning process

I like <abbr title="Tutorial Dojo">TD</abbr>'s **Review mode** and taking
notes for incorrect answers. I  dip into [Cantrill's
course](https://learn.cantrill.io/courses/enrolled/1101198) as and when I feel
like being a bit more passive / absorbant. I typically time box about 4 hours a
day to revision.

I take notes on paper and then write them up on my blog to re-enforce the
learning / memorisation. I've scheduled this exam for a morning 8AM slot when
my brain is the freshest, after a good nights sleep.
