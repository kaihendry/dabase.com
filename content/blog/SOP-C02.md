description: Studying for AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional
---

Three years have passed since I took the rather painful
[SAP-C01](https://dabase.com/blog/2020/AWS_Pro_exam_notes/) on my second try.
My certification has since expired and I thought lets challenge myself to <abbr
title="Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional">DOP-C02</abbr>.

I've given myself a solid week to prepare. Confident by the fact I passed
[SAA-C03](https://www.credly.com/users/khendry/badges) last week and btw here
are my notes [SAA-C03 learning notes](/blog/2023/SAA-C03/) that helped me pass first time.

Furthermore:

Lets checkout what [Reddit has to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/search?q=DOP-C02&restrict_sr=on).

* READ THE QUESTION Cost effective/low overhead/operational efficiency parameters will shape the answer.
* KNOW THE CODE* suite
* When in doubt, the answer is either Config or EventBridge

Bought the 96USD [@adriancantrill](https://twitter.com/adriancantrill) course https://learn.cantrill.io/, since it came recommended on Reddit:

And of course I bought <abbr title="Tutorial Dojo">TD</abbr> Jon-Bonso's Practice Exams:

# Action plan

I like <abbr title="Tutorial Dojo">TD</abbr>'s review mode and taking
notes if I got the answer incorrect. I will dip into [Cantrill's
course](https://learn.cantrill.io/courses/enrolled/1101198) as and when I feel
like being a bit more passive / absorbant. I typically time box about 4 hours a
day to revision.

I take notes on paper and then write them up, on my blog to re-enforce the
learning / memorisation. I've scheduled this exam for a morning 8AM slot when
my brain is the freshest, after a good nights sleep.
