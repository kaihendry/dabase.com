description: What tools do you need for a project?

When forming a working group between companies, the basic tools needed in order of importance <abbr title="In My Humble Opinion">IMHO</abbr>:

1. <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> aka where the files (often the "deliverables") are stored, e.g. Dropbox
2. Mailing archives -- Google Groups is probably the market leader, but then you need to buy into G Suite. I quite like [TopicBox](https://www.topicbox.com)
3. <abbr title="Bug Tracking System">BTS</abbr> aka Bug tracker -- I love Github, but their private repo based solution isn't really applicable for a _project_
4. Chat, for me as an old skool kid, I'd want <abbr title="Inter Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>. But Slack appears to be the market leader right now.


Ok, but what does **all four**?

**SOLUTION** [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/how-it-works) appears like it ticks most boxes. How do to get the data out or how to make use of its non-standard markup is another question entirely.
