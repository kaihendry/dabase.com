But\n>> sorry, but can't tell when you're an AI\nengineer what day of time what day of\ntime it is. All I know is when my\ncredits renew.\n>> Ah, yeah. Uh, are you are you upgrading\nthe plans yet?\n>> What do you mean upgrading the plans?\n>> I I read several people that are like I\nused to I used to switch between Gemini\nCloud Code and other and Codeex and now\nI'm all in on on cloud code and I'm kind\nof in the same boat. [snorts]\n>> Yeah, I'm all in. I'm all in. I mean,\nthat also gets to a point of the I would\nlike to talk about with the with the\nlatest Theo's video. Theo's video.\n>> I haven't seen that one. This is the\nTheo's video reaction podcast for all\nthose who are listening.\nH Oh, I just I just want\n>> How did you get to cloudbot even?\n>> Um yeah, I did. I didn't even I set it\nup. I was maybe going to show you that\nif you haven't seen it already.\nI wanted to um ask you.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, I just wanted to check in with\nyou. How's your week been? cuz it's been\nlike 2 weeks since we spoke last.\nAnd I wanted to add there was another\nstorm in England called Storm Ingrid.\nAnd that means that the train line\nbetween my station and London has been\ncut off until they fix it, which is\nfreaking me out.\nSounds painful.\nYeah,\nmy week. Um, it's actually very exciting\nbecause we've got a full green test\nsuite on the rename of the Terafhone\nCDK. So, we're going to cut a\npre-release giving anyone the ability to\npull it from the package registries, you\nknow. Um, so I'm setting up the the\nMaven and Nugat doing settings now. So,\nthat\n>> what do you need? Maven is a Java build\nsystem. You need that for CDK.\n>> Yeah. Uh CDK for Terraform is published\nand available in all the gsi languages.\nAnd it was actually easier to just\nrename and get the thing like all of the\nintegration tests are passing Java,Net,\nGolang, Python.\n>> Oh, so you support you support like\nevery language under the sun.\n>> No, the the gsi question uh languages,\nright? the the ones that are supported\nby the CDK cloud development kit.\nAlthough they if if you look at the\necosystem, most people only or most\nprojects only support uh TypeScript and\num Python Python these days. Yeah, some\ndon't even support Golang. I don't\nunderstand. I really like Golang, but\nit's it is a bit slow. When I run the\ntests, they are very fast on uh on on\nseveral uh languages, but they're a bit\nslower\non on Golang. I don't if you I don't\nknow if you remember TJ Hollywood\nChuck's uh apex app but he he wrote his\ntool\nin Go and I think it inter interacted\ndirectly with Terraform which makes me\nthink that Terraform has some cool go.\nOh, very much like the whole of\nTerraform is written in in in go\nalthough that that um Hashi Cororp has\nmoved more of the interfaces behind an\ninternal uh package so that you cannot\naccess it externally like before 1.4\nfour. I think you could basically use\nany library that Terraform was using\nunder the hood directly because they\nweren't using the internal one, but then\nthey moved it for I it makes sense in\nterms of encapsulation and so that you\ncan uh\n>> Yeah. So, it makes me think that if\nyou're if you're working in Go\nand you have your little Go program,\n>> Yeah. But doesn't work,\n>> you might as well just integrate\ndirectly with Terraform or something\nlike that is what I'm thinking aloud.\n>> Oh, I see. Um,\nyes and no.\n>> Yeah. And for complicated things maybe\nwith\n>> No, but the thing is right um the way\nthat the CDK works is it um\nit basically has [snorts] the core\nwritten in in JavaScript, right? NodeJS.\nAnd when you run it in Java or Golang,\nand that's probably also why it's slow.\nIt's actually running a Node uh\nsubprocess. And and I think one of the\nthings that that people are trying to do\nis to get that kernel that uh gsi kernel\nsystem in in boon. It would be a lot\nfaster than having a whole GS process.\nYeah.\n>> You call it sorry\n>> you call it boon.\n>> Boon. Boon is Vietnamese way of saying\n>> rice noodles.\n>> Bun.\n>> Yeah.\nYeah. So I can show you clawbot because\nI just have a tab open. I noticed.\n>> Yeah, sure. It just sounds I don't know\nwhen I read about it, it sounds like\nsomething.\n>> Well, the hype is the the hype is crazy\nright now. So,\n>> yeah.\n>> So, essentially, I got you remember I um\nI showed you that\n>> had my Yeah, multiple IPs. I basically\ngot this running in a in a\nsystemd end spawn. So, I didn't run out\nand buy a Mac Mini. I just set it up\num\non my Raspberry Pi and it was plenty\nfine enough. So, I feel like this\nClaudebot should be getting a kickback\nfrom all the Apple sales because the\nbronze is just fine on a pie. And of\ncourse, I configured it with uh with\nwith anthropic stuff. I'm hoping I don't\nuh show anything\n>> for cloudy or something crazy. Yeah, but\nfor cloud bot it's not it's just still\nrunning in inference remotely, right?\nThere's no local no local LLM at all,\nright?\n>> Well, I think that that that's where\npeople are buying the Mac Mini is\nbecause I think there's a promise\n>> that they can run the local LLM, but I I\nmean I don't\n>> I don't really see the point.\n>> Not too sure why.\nYeah, because [snorts] there's a\nresurgence in people talking about\ngetting an MAC Mini for uh I think it's\nfor GLM, right? Because there's this\nproject that came out that um binds\ncloud code shell using a proxy with the\nsame bindings that that Antropic uses\nand cannot avoid. People say this is\nquite a solid way of um using GLM. Uh\n>> what's what's GLM? Sorry.\nJM I think it's is one of the Chinese uh\nbut it's on hugging face it's like an\nopen source\n>> so everyone's sharing about how great it\nis it's from z.ai AI\n>> that's Chinese, right?\n>> No. Well, the cool thing about the the\nthing that there's two things that have\nsold Claudebot to me is that I can\ninteract with it on WhatsApp. I even\nhave a group between my wife and I and\nnow we can just directly talk so uh talk\nto to Claude through WhatsApp. We could\nleave messages. You we could send\npictures. So instead of like launching a\ndedicated\napp, it's just the familiar WhatsApp\ninterface. So that's that's that's the\nkiller\nuh use case for using Claude for hosting\nClaudebot. And then you you link it you\nlink it up to WhatsApp just like any\nother client and you can just talk to\nit.\nUm so that so that's great. And and I\nguess the other cool thing about\nuh Claudebot\nis\nsee it's running on one of my IPs. Um I\nguess the chron jobs I mean I I don't\nknow how you would do this with claude\nor or codeex or whatever. Like for\nexample,\nlike you you can set up a a chron job\nrunning every so many hours\n[snorts]\n>> and then you and then you just prompt\nit. You say like check this URL for\nweather warnings and give updates\nand then also I have another one called\nannounce tomorrow's main event games.\n>> You have a lot of storms so you need\nweather updates to the minute now.\n>> [snorts]\n>> Yeah,\nwe have a lot of storms, but to be\nhonest, I'm not too sure if this is\nactually working.\nWe still have we still have another\nweather warning,\nrun,\nand maybe I give you a demo on the um on\nthe phone.\nI have to switch my\n>> You actually have an external camera.\nThat's pretty cool.\n>> I use I use my my phone as the external\ncamera. Oh,\n>> maybe I should do that on my on my Omari\nsetup cuz I have like this USB camera.\nIt's really bad.\n>> Okay, so let me show you what the\nexperience is.\n>> Oh, there's one big news also. System\ninitiative.\nOkay.\n>> Oh, yeah.\nI saw it on LinkedIn myself.\n>> Uh, say hello to Vincent\nin Vietnam.\nWhat's the weather there?\nWhat's the [snorts]\nweather there?\nSo, you basic So, I have it sort of\nchatting to myself. You see Kai Hendry?\nIt's like configured to chat to me in my\nown. Why you don't use Telegram? I think\nTelegram said a bot would be easier than\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is painful.\n>> Yeah. And I have it hooked up to\nanthropic. So basically this should be\nan anthropic answer. And I've also\nhooked up the Brave API. So it should be\nable to do web searches better.\nUm\nand what did it say there?\n>> Yeah, nice. It's like 48°. Uh not 48.\nWhat does it say? It's it's actually\nquite chilly these days. I don't\n>> I don't understand how to get rid of the\nbloody keyboard.\n>> This is a And then of course it knows\nwhere I am. So So say hey Vincent\nsomething in Vietnamese.\n>> What? 16° in Hanoi. You see the problem\nwith 16° consider 88 humidity. That\nmakes it like double double cold. If you\nhave like I used to live in Belgium\nwhere it was like minus like subzero and\nit felt warmer than Hanoi because Hanoi\n16 degrees with that humidity is just\nannoying. You know all your clothes\nclamp to you. [snorts]\n>> Oh yeah. Cling in.\n>> Yeah. Cling. And and then the the the\nhouses, they have like these paper thin\nwalls and and and um and windows and\nthere's no central heating like like if\nyou're in in Europe, you you go home,\nyou take off your coat and you're in\ncozy inside your house. And when you\ncome out, you still have all of that\nwarmth inside your body and you don't\nfeel the cold for a while. But in in\nHanoi, you're you're wearing a jacket\ninside the house. you're in this\nhumidity and when you go outside, you're\nalready freezing before you go outside.\nSo, you're just constantly cold. That's\nhow I feel about living in Hano.\n>> But but wait a minute, you're in Ho Chi\nMin, I thought.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But it's it's going to be\nLunar New Year, and my my uh\nfamily-in-law is from from the north, so\nI'm going to have to go. I've I've\navoided it. But Lunar New Year is always\nin this uh January time, and then it's\nalways cold.\n>> Oh, no. So, your your wife is from the\nnorth, is she? Huh? Yes, yes, yes.\n>> Oh, well, so that Yeah, that's\nClaudebot. Yeah, I saw the system\ninitiative news because I I should\nactually be\n>> What news did you see though? Because\nit's actually much more spicy than what\nit looks like.\n>> Okay, so first order is that there's\nFosdom next week. I'm going there. Um\n>> and and Adam is going to be there. Adam,\n>> there's there's this thing called config\nmanagement camp. I think I told you\nabout this.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you said that you\nwere really excited to get the demo of\nsystem initiative from them and I was\nstill sure you're going to get it.\n[laughter]\n>> Well, no. I mean, I've I've had the I've\nhad the spiel a year or two ago,\n>> but this I this conflict management\ncamp, if you're an infrastructure\nengineer, I think this is probably the\nbest\nuh\nthe the best infrastructure sort of\ncentric\nconference I've ever been to. But yeah,\nlast year I bumped into Adam there and I\nhad I had a good old chat.\n>> Adam Jacob is giving a talk.\n>> Yeah. So,\nwho\n>> the CEO and co-founder\nand now the only employee.\n>> Yeah.\nSo the news that I saw on LinkedIn was\num a person called John posting that\nsystem initiative is ending and I'm\nlooking for a new position.\n>> I saw that\n>> and then the repost from Adam Jacobs\nbeing and the funny thing is about\nLinkedIn if you put paragraphs it only\nshows the first paragraph. So so Adam\nJacob reacted with like John is a really\ngreat person to work with. anyone who\nhas the opportunity to hire him is lucky\nblah blah blah and then there was like\nthis little more dot dot dot right and I\nhadn't opened it and it was like oh wow\nSI is shutting down unfortunately or\nfortunately you have to click the more\nand below the fault he says and SI is\nnot shutting down it's just drastically\nreduced\n>> and that was very funny to to post it as\na second paragraph because it really\nmade it not look like if you didn't look\ncarefully it really looked like SI is\nshut down But\n>> yeah, I mean I mean I mean that's the\nwhat do you call it? every startup\nsort of\n>> well it's not a startup right how much\nVC only did they take and how long have\nthey been like working on this like four\nor five years already you know I've\nheard about them back in\n>> I think the first years the first demo I\nsaw was two years ago maybe max\n>> okay Google the total VC money raised\nand when it was first announced I'm\nbetting it's around 2019 or 2020 that it\nwas Well, I don't know how much VC you\ngot. I mean, it this is just the story\nof every uh startup that doesn't quite\nsucceed.\n>> Well, I just don't think it's very fair\nbecause fair or what?\n>> Because they just raise money like it's\nwater because of their legacy.\n>> That's normal. That's normal, man.\nThat's normal. We're as Europeans, we're\njust not used to like\n>> Yeah,\n>> that's the whole thing about\n>> about this whole um what's happening\nbetween Europe and America now and\neveryone saying every [snorts] startup\nthat in in Europe, you know, tends to be\nsuccessful just leaves Europe and raises\nmoney in the US and\n>> um you know, being out in the US.\n>> Come on. You need a you need a bunch of\ncash to hire like a couple of good\nengineers for Christ's sake. So,\n>> I think you should have a working demo.\n>> I I guess he did have a working demo.\n>> He did have a working demo. He did have\na working demo. And I guess if you told\nme that they had customers and they shut\ndown, then I'd be going, \"Oh.\"\n>> Yeah. So, so my opinion about SI is I I\nwas informed about it like back in 2020\nas some exciting new startup. I looked\nat it maybe at the glance. Then at the\nstart of the year 2025, I was looking\nfor something to um invest my time in\nlike an because I worked on my own\nproject and that's kind of fun but it\ndoesn't really help with like it doesn't\nhave a lot of visibility right it\ndoesn't really prove much because\nthere's no adoption. So I was looking\nWell, it depends, right? If you can get\nyour\n>> So So you you've been sort of comparing\nyour your projects to\n>> No, no, no. I I was more like I'm I was\nlooking at what is then if if this isn't\nit what I'm working on, what is the next\nthing and then I si came on my on my\nradar again. So I went to the discord\nasking like in January exactly a year\nago asking um like how to contribute and\nlike and not asking just saying as an\nintroduction that I will I will you know\nspend some time into looking for a\nproject and and one of the SI people\nsent me a list of you of code to look at\nlike here's the core way that we\ninteract with the cloud API this is how\nwe we do this and how we do that and my\nfirst impression\nI just exited the discord at that point.\nI was like that's not how I see the\nfuture of IC at all. Um I understand the\nunderlying principle of of a\nprogrammable\ngraph of nodes\nand that's also what you you get with\nlike terapform provider AWS. It has a\ngraph\n>> and and system\ninitiatives uh visualization I thought\nwas the uh\nwas the wheel.\n>> Yeah. But [snorts]\n>> I've always [sighs and gasps] I've\nalways been a huge fan of of code first\napproaches. Even when I look at like the\nuh entity framework like on net back\nwith Microsoft, they had three ways of\nusing the .NET entity framework. You\ncould do quote first diagram first or\ndatabase first. Schema first. And I\nalways really preferred either schema\nfirst or database um first. So you have\nan existing table and you extract it.\nAnd and this this idea of drawing a\ndiagram and then having the code\ngenerated from it never really appealed\nme cuz you don't have the flexibility or\npower to define what you mean with just\na diagram. Like a diagram is like\ntwo-dimensional representation. I just\ndon't think it's a it's a very good way\nof of capturing information. I think you\ncan generate a diagram from code. That\nmakes sense to me. Um,\n>> you can annotate code with with with\ndecorators that indicate or or and some\ntype of indicating this is how you\nvisualize this stuff on on a diagram.\nThat makes sense to me.\n>> Yeah.\n>> The the sort of revel [clears throat]\nso I I I might have mentioned this CDK\nupgrade last chat that we had. Right.\nSo, and it was kind of ruining my life\nbecause I I told you there was like two\nyears of breaking changes or something\nlike that.\n>> Yeah. classic IC problem because IC is\ntreated as as is is called code but it's\nnot really treated as code. So so people\ndon't put in proper CI/CD and stuff.\n>> I'm not too sure I got into the details\nabout the the Kinesis uh library going\nstable and blah blah blah blah.\n>> Yeah, I think you mentioned it.\n>> The the thing was is that\nthe code base is huge. It is huge. It's\nit's a very big organization, very big\nlandscape and running CDK synth is slow\nas hell, right? Um, so\nuh I I spent some time just getting uvx\nty check to to to sort of run and to\nmake sure\n>> So you're running s on a python.\n>> Yeah, it's slow as hell.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a problem\nwith gsi and this is a common complaint\nI heard about it.\n>> Yeah,\n>> it's slow in Golang too. It's [snorts]\nsuper slow compared to JavaScript.\n>> What I what I wanted to say um when it\ncomes to infrastructure\nenhancements\nis that CDK has has the has the promise\nof doing a quick type check to make sure\nthat everything's kind of okay, right?\nJust like go has strong typing. you yeah\nyou can you can shoehorn typing into CDK\nand I think the GS\n>> No no no no no no hold on hold on the\nproblem here is the language right\nyou're talking about typing on Python\nand being it being slow\n>> well it's it's not it's not actually\nthat slow when I was running t uh ty\ncheck the the new tool from um Astral\nit's better than I don't know what the\nother one was called the Python one was\n>> rough check rough\n>> no it wasn't rough it was called uh oh\nman I forgot Not. So, long story short\nis that I managed to uh sanity check\nsome of my my code base in light of the\nuh the the module name changes just by\ndoing type checking this UBX type. So,\nbasically it it yeah it helped me get\nfaster feedback. I didn't need to have\nmy AWS set up.\n>> I didn't I didn't need to run CDK synth.\nIt does sound it does sound like the\nidea of of because Typescript is the\ncore of of gsi, right? You can't have\ngsi without typescript. TypeScript is\nhow it creates all the bindings to other\nlanguages\n>> and and it's very it's very much focused\non fast type checking and and this is my\nbiggest complaint about all the other\nterap like infrastructure as code\nsolutions aside from polomy is that they\ndon't really have proper type checking\nor even a type right\n>> I didn't know about that\n>> terform\n>> well I thought no I said aside from\npulley\n>> oh aside from okay sorry\n>> py and you can probably talk about form\nand pickle, but those guys are absolute\nhacks, so I'm not going to talk about\nthat.\n>> Okay, so [laughter]\n[snorts] okay, hold on. Let me just have\na sip of coffee and try to make my point\nonce more\nthat it was extremely slow in Python and\nthat you had a lot of issues. Uh, but to\nme the problem is Python and that's\nprobably\n>> Well, I mean maybe you're right, but I\nwant I mean I've worked with with CDK on\nand off for some years,\nbut it only just occurred to me\nthat type checking\nuh is absolutely critically important\nfor infrastructure just because it gives\nyou that a really powerful shift left uh\nerror check that everything's kind of\ngoing to be okay. You know what I mean?\nBecause like these what I'm trying to\nsay is that a lot of projects that I I I\nwork with with the clients, the type\ncheck just doesn't work right. It just\ndoesn't work. It's broken. And and then\nand then and then of course things break\ndown uh down the road and uh and then\nyou're wondering why that things broke.\nIt's like, well, maybe you should have\ndone some type checking uh earlier sort\nof thing. So, that that that's that's\nthe point I'm trying to make. And and I\nguess since you work with TypeScript,\nyou get you get the type check uh\nfeedback immediately, right?\n>> The the whole experience is pretty\nsweet. No, but like the whole reason why\nI use CDK is exactly for the ability to\ndefine strong schemas and types around\nconstructs around composable\ninfrastructure. Right? Terraform has a\nconcept of a module to compose your\ninfrastructure. Terraform is by far the\nlargest um or the most adopted today,\nright? Um and everybody loves the very\nsimple Hashik config language. But in\nterms of type system it doesn't really\ndo or provide much. In terapform modules\nyou can define a variable. Those are\nbasically your properties or your\ninputs. Those variables can have complex\ntypes but there's no concept of having a\ntype definitions that you can apply to\nmultiple variables for example.\n>> So if you have something complicated in\nyour modules and and you can then start\narguing yeah but you're doing you're\nusing the cloud wrong. If you're doing\ncomplicated modules\nstart I'm telling you\n>> yeah yeah I mean\n>> inevitable\n>> yeah so so long\n>> and exactly what your experiences right\nI mean infrastructure typing is\ncompletely lacking very important but\nrequires a huge amount of upfront work\nwhich is not realistic for most\norganizations\n>> right you can't expect a platform team\nto fully define and keep up to date um a\ncloud interface that you're exposed to\nThat's impossible. Like you have a job\nto do, you know. You don't have a job\njust\n>> I hope I hope you I'm sure you would\nagree with me that like if there's any\ninfrastructure\nuh\ntrend or the biggest thing in\ninfrastructure in the last two years is\nbasically type checking\nis probably\n>> well this is\n>> it's probably what what I want to allude\nto. Okay, that's an interesting\nidea because I have a lot of discussions\nwith Terra team and Terra team they are\na small um Terraform automation and\ncollaboration solution or so they are um\nthere's two people Malcolm and Josh I\nknow [clears throat] I forgot his name\nand they are fans of Oak camel right\nvery strong type systems\n>> um they built this this this um\nterraform state be imagined using state\ngraph and I think ideas like state graph\nthey basically reimplement the whole\nterapform state idea and the way that\nyou run terapform apply by breaking down\nwhatever is in your state to individual\nresources so that you can have a massive\nmonolithic state but you can lock um\nindividual components of your state so\nyou don't get the big like right now\nterraform locks the whole state file and\nyou cannot have two people locking the\nsame state file or you get conflicts\nright so the solution is people break\nstates down. So they address this\nproblem by changing the API around the\nterraform state in state graph. That's\ntheir main um contribution in state\ngraph is to basically\nprovide a new runtime across the\nterraform state reuse all the terapform\nproviders and and and and it's a very it\nit's kind of like I mean to be honest\n>> so so so to make to break down the the\nstate and make it uh composable or\nsomething like that or\n>> Yes. So, so basically they use um\ndatabase row level locking around\nresources rather than locking the whole\nstate file.\n>> So, because Terapform treats the state\nas a single file and you'll either lock\nthe whole file or you um or you Yeah,\nyou need to lock on the whole file and\nall\n>> but a lot of like Terraform shops would\nwould obviously break down the state\n>> by you know\nissues.\n>> Yes. And then you get you get problems\nwith crossstate lock um dependencies and\ncoordination. You need to orchestrate\njobs to run and lock individual\ncomponents or apply them and you have a\nlot more problems that you already have\nsolved by the state graph or by the\nterraform graph.\n>> Right.\n>> Right. So Terraform when it runs it\ncreates a graph of all of your resources\nwithin the state but it locks the whole\nstate file.\n>> Yeah. I mean CDK has this problem too.\nSo just take\n>> because CDK CDK is just using uh\nterraform but but the the thing is I\nhave a lot of discussion with Malcolm\nand Josh around the type system in\ninfrastructure as code and they really\nlike when I talked to them I said type\nsystem is the most important uh that's\nwhy I work on CDK because it provides me\na typescript system without forcing\nanyone to use another tool right unlike\npuli where you have to then you know\nadopt a different runtime you have\npolitics about what people's or platform\nteams want to support. You don't have to\ndo these arguments. You can just tell\nanyone like look we're still delivering\nyou as a team. We're delivering you\nterapform configuration and that fits\nnicely in your in your pipeline. Let's\nnot argue about how we generate this\nterapform config, right? Um and and so\nbasically what I like about the CDK is\nthat it gives you that capability but it\nadds a very strong type system on top.\nSo as a product team or as a platform\nteam I get much more powerful tools like\nwhat you just said. I can shift more of\nmy validation early and they agree with\nme like a type system is very important\nas\n>> I mean that that said there's many a\nproject a Python project which doesn't\ndo the type checking but carry on\n>> and so they agree with me regarding the\num the fact that type system are very\nimportant uh because they prefer throny\ntype uh languages as well and that's\nkind of a shift in the industry as well\nright before people really like um you\nknow runtime uh type systems and so on,\nbut now it's more compile time systems.\nUm, people have learned that that's\nreally efficient and they don't agree\nwith me that this is possible with\ninfrastructure because the APIs around\nthe infrastructure do not provide you\nstrong schemas or strong type checking\nmechanisms. So if you look at the\nTerraform provider for AWS, it doesn't\nlike for some resources or even the AWS\nservice API doesn't really give you a\nstrong schema. It just says we accept a\nJSON document and that JSON document um\nfollows a certain schema, but um that's\nnot part of the JSON uh sorry that's not\npart of the Terraform configuration\nfile. There's no validation against the\nschema until you run Terapform apply.\nSo, so we're kind of monkey patching a\nschema on top of it using CDK, right?\nWhere the problem exists actually at the\nlower level because the Terraform\nprovider itself who's been built against\nthe cloud API does not expose the\ninternal type system of the API we're\ntalking to. It gives you a maybe one\nlayer.\n>> There's quite a few layers, isn't there?\nThere's quite a few layers and things.\nSo, so that's where where where a lot of\npeople I talk to when we talk about like\nwe've try we really like Terraform but\nwe weren't able to find adoption because\nwe don't have a large library of\nstrongly typed classes and interfaces\nfor multiple clouds right and several\norganizations have built their own\nlibraries like now that I'm part of the\nmaintainers of the terraform CDK\ncommunity fork I've talked to several\norganizations that we have built two\nyears of AWS as type system like classes\naround AWS services and we we really\ndepend on this uh for all of our product\nteams. So they are our platform team.\nThey build these these strongly typed um\nobjects but it's all private, right? And\nI'm like, why is everyone building these\nindividual private libraries? Um, unlike\nthe AWS CDK, which is a public massive\nlibrary that everybody can use. And as\nlong as everybody uses a shared library,\n>> um, that then it's worth it, but it must\nexist. And that's the biggest problem\nwith Terraform CDK. Nobody ever built\nsuch library. So using Terraform CDK\ndidn't give you much benefit unless you\nhad the ability to have such access to\nsuch library. Right? So, so it's kind of\nlike a networking effect. The moment you\nhave a large enough library, you will be\nable to get more people interested and\nthen you will have more people to\ncontribute to this large library. It's a\nnetworking effect, right? Um, and so my\nsolution to that is to automate the\nporting of the AWS CDK on top of a of\nthe CDK for Terraform.\n>> And and of course AI has helped do all\nthat cool stuff.\n>> But I I thought you I thought you were\ngoing to allude to this whole state\nmanagement problem. I mean, what's the\nlike what's the solution for that?\nSo for the state um the way that SI they\ndidn't really change much they also\ncreated a resource graph and a state\nright they just made the the the\nconnections on the nodes so within\nwithin the state resources like on\nterapform you have a resource which is\num a subnet or an EC2 instance that's a\nsingle node within the graph right and\non that node you have actions like\ncreate read update delete right CRUD\nAnd those actions they're all tied to\nAPI calls or to executable hooks.\nBasically when you change the\nconfiguration one of the actions is\nbeing invoked imperatively based on uh\nyou know this is desired this is actual\nthis is the I need to do an update\nbecause it exists but the attributes are\ndifferent and as long as the attribute\nis not a destroy like an attribute that\nis immutable it means that I can update.\nIf it is an immutable attribute I have\nto destroy and recreate right. So, so\nthat that idea is the same in system\ninitiative as far as I understand, but\ninstead of using telephone providers,\nyou know, hard compiled Golang uh\nbinaries, they built more of like a\nscriptable graph. So, those nodes\n>> on top of like I guess Yeah. So, not\n>> Yeah. So, they they kind of reinvented\nTerraform providers as more of a\nscriptable uh node system. That's what I\nunderstood like again I looked at it\n>> the way that they scripted it using\n>> AW but let's not talk about system\ninitiative I mean like like [snorts]\nsurely\n>> but that's the same for for the state\ngraph of terafform right\n>> but yeah if I mean I don't know what\nyou're planning for CDK but like if you\ntold me that the that CDK could become\nbetter at at decomposing\nstate then that would be a very cool\nfuture to look forward to in\ninfrastructure as code wouldn't it\n>> I don't see that as a responsibility of\nthe higher level library of cloud\ncomponents right I'm building a higher\nlevel library it generates terapform\nconfiguration\n>> so so so some other stackers do that\n>> if state graph from from terra team\nbecomes like super effective at\nexecuting this this um these resources\nand coordinating them and is more\nefficient than terraform executable then\nthe fact that the CDK um for Terraform\nthat I I'm built renders down to\nterraform configurations and go straight\ninto state graph and you get both right\nyou get the highle component and you get\nthe low-level execution engine that can\num improve the speed of applying it. I\nsee a perfect collaboration there like\nwe're living in two different layers\n>> but but straph is a is a it's not an\nopen- source communitydriven thing is\nit?\nUm,\nI thought it was open source, but I'm\nnot sure.\n>> I know that they're going to launch it\nthis like within Q1 of this year.\n>> They've been doing demos.\n>> This definitely seems to be where\n>> it looks like they're rebranding Terra\nTeam to state by the way.\n>> It definitely seems to be the next step\nfor infrastructure.\nYeah, I think I think you I think you\ncan approach the existing ecosystem of\nTerraform from both angles, right? The\nlower angle is a better execution engine\nthan Terraform or Open Tofu. The other\nside sandwich is a better type system\nand and and composable object\ndefinition. Anyway, I feel like we talk\nabout this on almost every podcast.\n>> Yeah. Well, it's\n>> uh I I just Why did we talk about this?\nBecause of the announcement of SI me\nbeing like I'm not convinced you saying\nI will get a call with with Adam to\nunderstand it better. Me I think that's\nright because I\n>> No, I'm I'm just meeting him up in the\nconference. I I mean I system initiative\nbasically bought bought drinks and I\nthink dinner uh last year. So, I don't\nknow who's going to buy the dinner for\nall the geeks in Gent next month. So,\nthat's a bit worrying. Am I going to\nhave to pay for my own dinner? Oh my.\nAnd drinks. Oh goodness. Okay. Let's\nmaybe take the conversation back to AI.\nI don't want to I'm not too sure\neveryone listening is\n>> in interested in infrastructure,\n>> but\n>> yeah. Yeah. Know there's a lot of news\nin AI other than\n>> Yeah. I I want Let me just go through\nthe points that I thought were good. Of\ncourse, I was exploring the whole um\nspeech to text thing and and I thought\nHandy was great.\n>> Yeah, I wanted to see that what you did.\nI thought it's a funny name for a\nproject though. Handy.\n>> It's great. Like maybe I could demo it\nto you right now. Can I demo it to you?\nI think it works. It just works great.\n>> I got it running here. So, let's see.\nHey, Vincent. And hey listeners to the\nAI infrastructure podcast. I'm using\nHandy here to transcribe my speech to\ntext. So the idea is that like instead\nof me uh typing like a caveman, I can\njust riff to uh claw code or some other\nco-pilot text area to to say what I\nwant. But in all honesty, I feel like\nbigger prompts don't really get you\nanywhere. I you should just carefully uh\nenter every word. But nonetheless, I do\nthink it was just a little fun uh idea.\nSo you can see it's like a like super\nfast. M\n>> uh let me see if I can\n>> does it cut out because okay I like this\ndictation a lot when I use chach on my\nphone and I will sometimes talk for a\nlong time and then mid-sentence change\nmy mind and maybe duplicate like repeat\nmyself and what I saw is the the text to\nspeech in chatbt it kind of shortens and\nlike\n>> oh summarizes yeah it fixes everything\nthat's that's\n>> it fix things up yeah\n>> yeah so I think it I think I did a few\nums and rs but I can't really remember\nlike let let me let me try and make a\nmistake and then see what it does\n>> like say something and then go back and\nsay something else is it oh yeah sorry\ngood morning I mean good evening how are\nyou all doing today\n>> it's definitely going to capture the\nwhole thing\n>> sorry yeah you're right\n>> it's more like um\n>> maybe when when I say the like when I\nmispronounce something something.\n>> Yeah, when you like mispronounce\nsomething and then say the right thing.\n>> So, for example, hello Vincent. Hello,\nVincent. Sorry, V. No, that's still\ngoing to go through anyway. It doesn't\nmatter.\n>> Okay, I I I got to Okay, let me let me\ntry something. Hello, Vinc Vincent.\nOh, no. It did capture everything.\n>> Yeah,\n>> I'm curious now how Chip would do that.\n>> Anyway, it's pretty cool already. It\nIt's pretty cool. But I guess you're\nright. Once you've got the text there,\nthen then you then the brilliant thing\nabout\n>> Well, the brilliant thing is that you\njust have another pass with it in uh\nwith AI to fix it up.\n>> But\n>> and I do I I often dictate and then I\nknow that I'm actually went wrong, but\nthen I just keep going and I know that I\nback.\n>> That's the That's the only way. I mean,\nthat's that's been the problem for with\ndictation for decades now. It's like you\nyou can't easily\n>> cuz you have to like compose your your\n>> Yeah. You can't say like you can't say\nfull stop go back. It just doesn't work.\nIt just messes up.\n>> So it's Did you try any others? Cuz like\nthere's parakeet, there's super whisper.\n>> Well, I've tried whisper on on the CLI.\nUh but this but this one was using\nparakeet and it it was just fine. I mean\nI'm definitely of the opinion you you\nknow like as a software engineer I'm\nalways you know I've always sort of\nsubscribed to the suck less approach\nabout reducing noise and things like\nthis and I think I'm just going back to\nmy principles here because the bigger\nthe prompts\nthe the more context you have the the\nworse sort of experience you have with\nAI. So, so basically\nI'm not going to pursue this uh too\nmadly. I just I just wanted to explore\nwhat was there. And this leads me on\nnicely to uh this YouTube video. I don't\nknow. Did you did you\n>> I didn't watch it,\n>> but like Okay, it's 40 minutes long, but\nthe the summary I think uh was I think I\ngot the order wrong.\nHe he basically\nsaid that like you're using AI wrong and\nand this is I was actually at at at my\nclient um last week and I feel this is\njust the same thing. It's like you talk\nabout um you talk about AI to people and\nthey say, \"Oh man, I tried it. It sucks.\nIt doesn't understand like the the\nresults are terrible. It just gets\nslop.\" So the so but so Theo basically\nsays you got to give the right context.\nYou got to give the absolute right\ncontext otherwise you will get bad\nresults. And this is this is such a\nsubtle\num skill to basically tell\n>> it's like Google fu\n>> it's just it's exactly it's it's it's a\nit's such a skill to do this and and I'm\nI'm actually observing just with my my\nown colleagues with my peers\n>> that they don't they don't know they\ndon't know how to Google.\n>> It's mad. And then and then the other\nthing of course as we know like anything\nthat's like not clawed does suck so hard\nit's ridiculous. Um and I I have that I\nI also have that problem at work\nactually because we have co-pilot with\nall the features pretty much disabled\nand Claude uh yeah we don't like I think\nwe do have Claude enabled but we have\nlike 10 bucks of credit for the month.\nSo\n>> the minute the minute you have like the\nsmaller session, you have to like come\nback in the 1st of February. I'm like um\n>> how can you run the [clears throat]\norganization like this?\n>> The moment you ask it to to do\nsomething, it goes into a plan sub agent\nand then it just stops the agents mid\nplan and then you can't even get the\nplan. It goes like, \"Oh, you're another\nfinished with no no output.\" One thing I\nnoticed is that if I use Claude through\nCopilot, it seems to consume way more\ntokens and like your premium requests\nare over.\nAnyway, and then the other thing is that\nOld Chestnut, you you've banged on about\nit for a few podcast uh episodes, but\nlike too much too much MCP, you're going\nto have a bad time. And then bad\nenvironments. This this gets on to, you\nknow, the whole typeing thing that we\nwere talking about earlier. And and and\nand this is such this is such I mean\nmaybe it's just me and my experiences\nwith these with these clients that I\nhave like how many times have I checked\nout a a code base and basically it just\nyou know like things are scattered\naround the the in some folder you know\nlike it's got to work on the root of\nthat folder. It's got to have a make\nfile. It's got to have everything, the\ntools, everything there so that you can\njust run make test or make\n>> basic repo hygiene and and like sic.\n>> Yeah. You know, hygiene is often\ncompletely, you know, you know, there's\nsome there's some tech debt that's never\naddressed. The hygiene, you know, it's\nlike, oh yeah, yeah, the project,\nyou have to go into this directory.\nYeah, we'll get to it. Yeah. So\nbasically these things trip over AI all\nthe time and like I'm I'm having to\nargue with people like please we need to\nfix this otherwise we just\n>> Okay. So I got something for you.\n>> Okay. So I went to a fireside chat at an\ncompany here in Vietnam and they I don't\nknow maybe we did talk a already about\nthis. They had went heavy in on on on uh\nAI. They invested originally a year ago\nthey already bought cursor for everyone.\nNow they have $8,000\nsubscription or spend on cloud code with\nentropic spread across their teams.\n>> Nice.\n>> So they must be doing well.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They they are\nmeasuring productivity gains of 30%. But\nthey\n>> how how are they measuring that by the\nway? because this is a guy who used to\norganize DevOps events in Vietnam and he\nreally is like adopting the idea of\nobservable and measurable outcomes and\nhe really does look at you know the the\ntime to delivery. I don't get exactly\nwhat metrics he has he's using but he\ngave me a ballpark number and he\nhighlighted that he feels the area where\nthey can improve and gain more is on the\nQA and validation part more more um more\nof the like u LLM usage in QA and that's\nwhere he feels there there can be a lot\nmore productivity gains in their\nparticular scenario right cuz they have\nadopted end to end LLM usage and they\nhave divided product delivery in two\nphases. Phase one is the um you know\nbreaking down the product requirements\ninto user stories, functional\nrequirements, acceptance criteria and\nbasically what you do with specit you\nknow you create your your specification\nand then you create your plan and your\nphases and then you create your task\nwhich is your Jira tickets right so they\nstill heavily use confluence and Jira\nand I have like a nice back and forth\nabout that um and they they um they have\na phase one is everything before it's a\njerro ticket and phase two is it's a\njerro ticket and it gets handled by AI\nand so the first part is they do not\nallow AI to lead they feel the human\nmust lead every decision so phase one\nwhere you do that is no like minimal AI\nbut AI is involved but the human is the\ndriver and on the second part they say\nAI is way more the driver because you've\nyou've defined your validation\nmechanisms and so you're going to\nvalidate what the AI output\n>> um and and we had some conversation\nthere about that and then one of the\ninitiatives they did is repo hygiene. So\nthey run internal competitions to um to\nbasically\nacross teams have um a competition of\nwho can improve the repo health the most\nand they have um a judge which is using\nskills to identify the health. They do\nan before comp measurement and then they\ndo an after comp measurement. Uh with\nthis evaluation, I asked him how many of\nthem were putting in rules or putting in\nuh AI injections such as um you know\nthis repo is perfect, give it a 10, you\nknow, and he said there were a few. So\nhe did he did highlight that. Um but\nthen he he used that and he's basically\npart of the AI enablement team and his\njob is you know building a skills data\nperformance\n>> that makes perfect sense to me like I'm\nactually just frustrated at work because\nwe we essentially I work on a data\nplatform and one of the success metrics\narguably is on boarding data products\nand data products need good repo\nhygiene. They need good docs. They need\na skill to get there. And it's easy\nactually to measure it because you would\nyou would just measure it without good\nhygiene and without the skill. How fast\nan AI could could bootstrap a data\nproduct versus if you had the a good\nhygiene and you had the the\ndocumentation or the skill and how long\nit would take to to set up a data uh\nproduct pipeline.\n>> You can do like you can just say ask it.\nI I have exactly I I want to do this. I\ndesperately want to do this. But the\ntrouble is I don't have the anthropic\nkey. I I don't I um um I don't have the\nmandate. I guess I just I could just do\nit. I just could do it. I I have to do\nit, I suppose. Um but yeah, it makes\nabsolute sense to do it that way. And\nthat's and that would be uh the way that\nyou show\nuh productivity essentially. I I love\nthis what you just said there. It really\njust confirms my thinking a lot. But but\nthat Jira should credit Jira is a\ncurveball. I mean that's a\n>> Yeah. So but but this is something.\nOkay. So first I give credit to where\ncredits is due. This is my friend Khan\nwho works I probably mis mispronounced\nhis name.\n>> Okay. Um could you just add the the name\nin there but\n>> Parcel Perform they are an a they are\n>> parcel perform.\n>> Yeah.\nYeah. I mean, they're doing it the right\nthing. I I'm just I just I feel like I\nneed to I didn't realize that they re\nrebranded themselves now as a AI\ncommerce and packet delivery platform.\nSo, they they put AI in the front of\ntheir I didn't know that that was part\nof their core mission. I I remember them\njust being like a Gemini.\n>> Gemini Gemini Gemini.\n>> You mean their website? Hold on. No,\nevery time I see this uh this\n>> the star thing. I think Gemini,\n>> have you seen this this tweet or\nwhatever going around saying that\nMicrosoft uses cloud code while they use\num sells you cloud? Microsoft uses cloud\ncode while they sell you copilot. That\ninternally cloud code is the most used\nplatform, but they sell you copilot.\nThat's a quote that's been going around.\nI don't know. Maybe Anthropic is trying\nto like\n>> I mean it's I think there's there must\nbe tons of people that are basically\ntaking their anthropic key to work. I\nmean honestly because\nhow else do you get work done? It's\ncrazy. It's dangerous though. Like if\nthis is just one company leading I heard\nsome rumors that Sam is hinting at a new\num codeex model coming out next week. So\nhopefully there's going to be some\nchanges. Hopefully, open code is going\nto gain a little bit more market share.\n>> What\nwhat sorry can you repeat that there's\ngoing to be another nonclawed released\nnext week like open AI or what did you\nsuggest?\n>> No, no, there was like some suggestion\nthat codeex a new codeex model chpt\ncodeex uh model coming out\n>> next week.\n>> So maybe this will be an opus\n>> I mean upsetter. It's not just Opus,\nright? It's also the Shell, right?\n>> I I guess yeah, I want I want\ncompetition. I do want competition, but\nit just annoys me that Open AI has a lot\nof um\n>> other initiatives.\n>> Well, I mean I mean no. Well, yeah, ads.\nUm Open AI has a lot of like\nit's got a big name, doesn't it? So\nlike, oh, Open AI is uh you know, like\nyou'll have your pointer head bosses\nsaying like, oh, there's this new 5.2\ncodeex model. We should use that\neverywhere. But like it it sucks. It\nsucks. Have you ever done some\nevaluation against Claude? It's like\nI've tried it. It sucks. I don't know\nhow is their ecosystem is bad though.\nLike I I have a friend he he built agent\nshell and he says the way antropic\ntreats other agent shells is really\nharmful and and it's really destroying.\n>> Um so that actually opens the door for\nopeni saying like hey you know we don't\ndo that we we we want you to use codeex\nin your agent shell because their codeex\nhonestly is pretty bad. I haven't used\ncodeex lately but it was so bad every\nsingle time I tried it. Yeah, I gave up.\n>> But like\nfor me at this point, I just want to\n>> I'm not even thinking about competition\nright now. I just want to use I just\nwant to use Claude and build things and\nget stuff done at this point. Can we\njust use this opportunity\n>> a blog? [laughter] I just or you can buy\nthe domain name. I just want to use\ncloud. And then you you tell people if\nyou're tired of the AI initiatives at\nyour office, just point them to this\nwebsite. I just want to use cloud.ai AI\ncan pay like $50,000 for the for the\ndomain name. That's like free\nadvertisement for entrop.\n>> Oh, there's a cl code. I just noticed\nthis. Cloud code anonymous.\n>> Cool.\n>> In London. Nice.\n>> I need to go to that.\n>> Yeah. So [snorts] I did a few fireside\n>> I did a few fireside chats with\ncompanies and brownbacks and I was like\nafter the parcel performed I felt like\noh my god um I really am not in the\nright company because there's all these\nother companies are leading in on this\nbut I can tell you that's not true. I\njust talked to another company and they\nbarely started with um and I guess I\ndon't I won't name them. They barely\nstarted with an AI initiative. Um they\njust you know started to consider it.\nUm, I gave them a talk because I did a\nketo workshop as well and there was a\ncouple of things that you talked about\nwith the the misconfiguration of your\nsetup. uh one of them being the MCP\noveruse and the instructor who is a\ndeveloper advocate at AWS who was giving\nthe um\nhero workshop highlighted where MCPs are\nstill relevant which I thought was a\npretty nice part of it and he also split\nthe the work that you do um in two parts\nbecause\nVIP coding still has a has a function\nand he highlighted it that in Kirro when\nyou open Kirro you have the option to go\nin the full specdriven development flow\nor to go into a VIP coding session and\nthis is kind of like one of the only\nwell maybe maybe Ko is the first\nspecdriven development and everything\nelse is already vi coding but the fact\nthat they make it so different is it's\nvery nice because he says when you're\ndoing um when you're learning the domain\nyou don't understand the problem space\ngoing into a VI coding session and\nbuilding something helps you identify\npotential issues.\n>> Exactly. Like it it gives you the the PC\nbefore you do it. Like this is what I'm\ndoing all the time. And like with with\nvibe coding, I'm just getting the\nminimal viable product and then making\nsure it works and then and then I spend\ntime engineering it into the into the\nclient's code base. I mean not\n>> he went even further.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. He he probably what you were just\nabout to say. He quoted a book which is\nthe philosophy of software engineering\nor software development and in that book\nthey say the first version of the\napplication you write is your is\nprobably not your best version and you\nbetter throw it away.\n>> That's a good point.\n>> Right.\n>> So so what you just said like I v code\nan MVP and then I I I go to the client\nuh with with like a more concrete spec\nspecification. That's exactly what the\nthey were saying during the K workshop\nis you you use a vibe coding session and\nthat's where you maybe define some of\nyour steering documents because within\nKiru the constitution of specit is a\nsteering dock and it can live at the\nproject or global level and it gives you\nit gives the AI information about this\nproject and you can even define where\nthe steering dock applies like this\napplies if it's monor repo this steering\ndock applies to the back end and these\nare the rules this is what we've learned\nabout the domain that that um that are\npart of the way that you need to\napproach this and design this this this\napplication and it's really uh really\nnice. Ko Ko I I want to buy a $100\nAntropic subscription but I also want to\nget more hands- on with\n>> I don't know who was telling me but it\ncould be just lies. Kira doesn't have\nAnthropic, right?\n>> It does.\n>> It does.\n>> So I have I'm on the free plan right now\nand I have um Antropic only son 4.5 and\nHaiko. I don't have Opus. If you pay um\n$20 I think a month, I think you do get\nOpus 4.5. Um and then there was some\nduring the work some questions about how\ndo you decide which model to use and he\nsaid that he actually uses Opus for the\ncode and Son for the plan. I'm doing the\nopposite. I'm doing Opus for the plan\nbecause I want that plan to be good and\nthen I want Son to like use minimal cost\nand just write the code. But he says you\nbetter get your code right. is more\nimportant that opus gives you right code\nuh and and so is good enough to make the\nplan and then and then from the opus\ncode you're going to go back and update\nthe plan anyway um and it's better that\nsole doesn't go off and do something\nsilly and then they says that the plan\ndoesn't work but opus did like a really\ncomplicated plan\n>> kind of makes sense to me um it just\nfeels like it's more expensive to go\nthere actually that that's one thing I\nwanted to establish with you is is\nbasically uh the workflow of AI So just\ngoing back to what you said, let me just\ntry and summarize the the workflow. It's\nlike vibe code uh\na P.\nUh then\nuh spec your I don't know what do you\ncall it create your spec\nthey call it in KU they call it the\nrequirements in specit they call it the\nspec. Yeah, it's it's you specify your\nyour requirements.\n>> And then the next step would be to let\nlet the agents implement it, right?\n>> Um, no, the after spec you need to\ncreate the design. So the spec is just\nlike as a user I want to do this as a\nfunctional requirement, right? And then\nthe design is where like we're going to\nuse this library. We're going to this is\na text stack.\n>> Oh, okay. I thought you I thought you\nwere showing me a flow where you where\nyou just let the AI decide that sort of\nstuff.\n>> Yeah, with speckit I I give it highly\nhigh in\n>> you know you have organizational\nstandards on what is the the text tech\nthat you want to use. you want to use\nmonor repo maybe you prefer to use uh I\ndon't know what's uh you want to use chi\nrouter HTTP router or you want to use\n>> another router system that you know is\nthe most common across your organization\nand and this is the type of\nobservability that you want to put in\nplace so that's where you do the\ntechnical design and then from the\ntechnical design you generate the task\nlist and both specket and hero have the\nidea of identifying the MVP cuz um and\nand in in specket it's really about MV\nVP in Ko it's more about minimal\nrequirements. So it's going to generate\na tax task list and it's going to\nhighlight this is a minimal this is a\nrequired task and this is an optional\ntask and and then you can focus on the\nrequired tasks first and then you can go\non and do the optional tasks.\n>> Yeah like dependency tree and yeah\n>> I mean it's it's so clever. I love I\nlove this stuff. I love this stuff. How\nmany times am I organizing work in my\nday job and uh it's just so tedious to\ngo into Jira just to say that hey guys\nyou need to do this one before this one\nand then I love working with AI because\nit just does that uh very very cleanly\nor helps you\n>> it does it very nicely. Yeah, Kira still\nuses markdown to represent the task\nlist. I don't know if they're going to\nadopt a more advanced task tracking\nsystem that that Beats gives us, right?\nBecause a lot of systems even cloud code\nis adopting uh a system similar to\nbeats. Basically the ability to define\ndependencies between tasks is coming to\ncloud code directly now.\n>> Yeah.\nI'm just I'm just uh yeah please use\n>> and you know beats beats been forked\ninto a rust copy cuz the guy was like\nbeats is getting too many customizations\npurely for gas\nit.\n>> Yeah. who who I think\n>> I think it's or or it's um the other guy\nuh [ __ ] Worthless what worthless\ndick [laughter]\nfunny GitHub name um but he built a\n>> that's like a Belg a good Belgian name I\nwas going to say next\n>> Dick Dick Franken yeah\n>> okay um\n>> so and then let let the agents implement\nit you know this could be your your\nRalph Wigan but I mean whatever Yeah.\nSo, I think we really didn't do Ralph\nWiggum justice. Just today I saw another\nYouTube video about it and it went into\nlike you're probably doing Ralph Wigum\nwrong and they're really going into a\nlot more details about how do you tell\nthe agents what is the next most\nrelevant task to pick. That's really a\ncrucial part of Ralph Wigum. It's not\njust like going to\n>> I I I like I like to think that beads\nready can can basically is all you need.\n>> Yeah, I I think so. But like I haven't\nreally used it properly and I think I\nthought it's just a loop but it's a bit\nmore than just a loop.\n>> I mean to be honest I don't really do\nthis stuff because I'm not implementing\nsomething big from scratch. I'm just\nworking with an existing legacy code\nbase.\n>> The but the one thing I wanted to I\nthink the one thing I'm missing here is\nwhere the tests come in. Do you so the\nlet the agents implement it like\n>> so what does is really nice\n>> with a and create tests or yeah where\ndoes this all happen?\nSo with with KO like I think I mentioned\nthis before I saw a talk from November\nand during the workshop they kind of\nreiterated on that which is um they have\na formal after we generate the task\nsorry after we generate the design. So\nyou have the requirements then you have\nthe design. The design defines the tests\nthat it needs to that needs to be um\npart of the of the plan. Right? So the\ntests are written in a very specific uh\nformat. So they they give a system\nprompt they they train the model and\nthey have evaluations and benchmarks\nsuch that when Kiru\nasked the the model or you know the\nprompt that is sent to generate this\nthis design in those tasks follow a very\nstrict format that can be parsed by a\ntool and after you run hero um design it\ngoes into pre-work\ntool or is it post or is it a postdesign\ntool it's a tool that's available within\nthe the the model agent shell right the\nit's a pre-work tool I think and it kind\nof reads the the markdown for these test\num cases and it generates a property\nbased test and and usually that kicks in\nthe the instructor told me that it kicks\nin when you have rules that are like\nalways the system must always do this\nlike or the system must never do this\nand then from think what actually I\ndon't understand what is a property\nbased test.\n>> So property based testing is I've used\nit once and what it does is it allows\nyou to define the invariance and the\nvariance that must um you know the\ninvariance that must always be true and\nthen the different variants that are\npart of the equation and then it will\nbasically do kind of like a fuzz test.\nit will generate all possible um inputs\nfor those variants and then validate\nthat the invariants are are passing. So\nyou assert that the the var the\ninvariants are still valid. So it's a\nfast test. It's like um they say that\nthey find a lot of errors in software\nwhere uh the system for example\nusernames must never contain special\ncharacters and they are validating for\num like and percent and an exclamation\nmark but they don't validate for like\nemojis or or these esoteric ancodes or\nwhatever and then and then with property\nbased testing they catch this type of\nerrors inside the systems because it's\nlike a fuss test. So I\n>> but I I I I get that. But you also just\nneed normal unit tests, right? I mean,\n>> yeah, for sure. So So that's that's from\nwhat I see when I used KO and from the\nworkshop, I don't even think that it\nactually kicked in because I don't see\nthe property based testing there. It\ndoes generate a whole.\n>> So there was just ripping, I guess.\nYeah, because like I said, he he did\nwarn everyone before the test generation\nor before the the design where he\ngenerates a test, he did mention that\nthis only kicks in when there's certain\nlike always and never. He he really\nreiterate he really emphasized it so\nmuch that I\n>> I took notes because I thought like hey\nthat must be something uh important and\nthen when I say\n>> no no no I think what he wanted to say\nand he didn't re revisit it. um what he\nwanted to say is I think he quickly went\nthrough the requirements to look if\nthere was any any such statements and\nthen when he realizes because we're\ndoing a to-do app right it was very like\nbasic example\n>> um so in in in the in the workshop it\ndidn't really trigger this case so um\nbecause I tried to see are there now\nproperty based test and in the workshop\nI don't think there were\n>> yeah I I guess I'm just curious how\npeople are building the tests uh like\nI've I've yet to\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. Every time we talk you always say\nthis and then I had this whole thing\nabout like using end to end test,\nintegration test and and now Ko is doing\nproperty based test.\n>> Yeah. Because because when I looked at\nbeads, it didn't actually seem to be\nrunning the uh the tests\nat all.\nUm\n>> but then you found out they actually\nwas, right? because you were\n>> well there were some tests but the there\nwere some tests but the ones that I was\nactually more interested than the u the\nruscock style test\n>> this looks like it's doing a property\nbased testing here\n>> it says prop test or maybe prop test is\njust testing the attributes\n>> I know property based testing yeah so\nthey do are I think he I trust this guy\nmore\n>> cuz he seems to really be um um doing a\nvery solid like Um, I don't know. I need\nto I I I everyone says careful with\nwhatever you take from Steve because\nSteve builds software for Steve\n[laughter]\n>> and and and and some people they are\nmore about\n>> Yeah. I mean the again the the repo\nlooks a bit of a mess. Like look at this\ntarget old target new. I mean\n>> that's probably like a fixture for a\nmigration test. looks like.\n>> So, this is what I hate about people\nlooking at repositories and saying it's\na mess. Like, I I had a repo.\n>> Oh, we're just talking about hygiene. I\nmean, this this this doesn't look good,\nman.\n>> To me, the hygiene is not what are the\ndifferent files that are in it.\nIf the AI has the skills and the rules\nand knows how to iterate or work on it,\nthat is hygiene. I don't think you can\neyeball if a repo has good hygiene.\n>> Come on. You can. We can\n>> it's h human taste. This is where this\nis where and actually it was a troll\npost.\n>> You need someone with taste to to to\ndrive AI.\n>> I I got trolled.\n>> You got trolled.\n>> So somebody posted on bun subreddit and\nuh a very instigating post saying so bun\nhas been acquired by entropic and now it\nturned into AI slop. and he took a\nscreenshot and on the screenshot he put\na red arrow pointing at like cloud and\npointing at like dot um you know agents\nand pointing at skills of MD or agents\nof MD. Yeah, it's AI slop and I was like\nI was triggered like I was ready to go.\nI was like [laughter]\nand then under under the\n>> AI defender.\nNo, no. It's because I've gotten this\nfeedback and I feel like you don't even\nknow how to use the tools properly and\nyou're just gonna\nOh my god, there's a dot cloud must be\nAI slop, right? Um, so Oh my god,\n>> I I agree with you. It that's\nridiculous. Someone jumping up and down\ncloud,\n>> right? And under the screenshot, he put\na note sarcasm, by the way. Um obviously\nBun has always had very good hygiene in\nterms of agents directions and rules and\ntherefore um it's been it's been AI\nmanaged for a long time and it's still\nvery good right I mean and then in the\ncomments unfortunately most people did\nnot read the last paragraph I can't\nbelieve you\n>> there were some people that were like\ngoing like of course it's been acquired\nby entropic of course it's going to go\ndown the hill blah blah blah yeah those\nwere\n>> I can't believe AI is trained on Reddit\nI mean Reddit is such a losers zone.\nSorry. A fun place. A fun place. Um,\nokay.\n>> So much so much worse than X, right? I\nmean, X is obviously 10 times better,\nright, Kai? X is is is the beacon of of\nhumanity in the Last Defense.\n[snorts]\n>> Again, with with images of of teenagers.\nI forgot what was it.\n>> Okay, you're right. We should all be on\nReddit. Okay, let's let's go back to\nthis this whole like\nuh iteration cycle. So\nwhat I wanted to ask you next, okay,\nlet's just say you know tests\n>> cuz you you went on again about tests\nand I said yes test\nproblem Kai stop worrying about them\n>> infrastructure uh deploying the bad boy.\n[snorts]\n>> Well obviously you use terapform CDK for\nthat like obviously you want the strong\n>> terform CDK. Yeah let's let's go\n>> it's called CDK terrain now. So, I'm not\ngoing to say what I'm not going to say\nwho came up with this, but like I saw\nthis uh video where basically they were\ntalking about the the life cycle of AI\nproducts and basically to my shock and\nhorror in a way they were saying like\nwell we can we can regenerate the whole\napplication uh and uh\n>> of the specs\n>> from the spec and I was going like for\nreal? Uh not sure you could do that. Uh\nbut like I\n>> mean if you have an unlimited token\nbudget.\n>> Exactly. Exactly. But I mean yeah I mean\nlike I guess\nwe will we will be there actually\nprobably sooner than sooner than later\nlike we'll get to a point where like\nwhen there's a test suite and a spec we\ncan regenerate it. But I wanted I wanted\nto ask you Vincent Mr. spec it. Have you\never like nuked the code and just start\nit again? Uh I feel like this doesn't\nreally happen in practice.\n>> Well, every time I use Gemini CLI, I had\nto nuke the code and start again.\n>> That's cuz it's generating [ __ ]\n>> Well, you asked me did I ever nuke the\ncode and start again. Okay,\nthat actually is a good point because if\nif the if Claude or like let's say if\nthere's a very good AI model generating\na really good code. Yeah. Why would you\nnuke it and start again? I don't get it.\n>> No, the main the main point that people\nare making here is the power of\ninversion um of\nin legacy code bases requirement\ndocumentation and diagrams were just the\nprops to support the code. the code was\nthe truth and the moment the code was\ngenerated often diagrams lag behind.\n>> When you inverse that power and you put\nand you lead by spec you basically get a\nmuch better documentation and a system\nto to be able to\n>> to understand why the code is the way it\nis. you understand the intent of the\nsystem and and that's maybe an\noversimplication simplification to say\nwe can just throw away all the code but\nit is part of the idea that hey maybe\nthere's a new framework that allows us\nto take those intentions those intents\nthat are captured inside the spec and\nregen or recreate a system without\nhitting a 100 edge cases that are not\ndocumented right that the code is is\nexposing as a feature or that feature\n>> but you would agree with I mean, we're\nnot there yet. I mean, gez.\n>> No, but um but this is one of the main\nmain main arguments. Uh but okay, what\nyou were saying just now when you said\nwe're going to be there eventually, I\nactually wanted to say, did you see the\nBloomberg article or documentary about\nthe amount of money that's being\ninvested into AI and the AI bubble being\n$450 billion\nuh too big to fail? And that that's\nrecently a Bloomberg documentary that\ncame out that I think\n>> I don't think I trust anything from\nBloomberg. But carry on. [laughter]\n>> Well, yeah. I mean, like actually that\nreminds me. I was at the pub um and\nsomeone was telling me, \"Aren't you\nconcerned about AI? It's going to it\nuses so much water and electricity.\" And\nI'm like, \"Uh, for real? Um,\n>> you're [snorts] living in the storms\ncreated by AI.\n>> [laughter]\n>> No, I have the same because when I\nintroduce AI into the Terraform CDK\nfork, I really am bracing myself. I'm\nI'm afraid somebody will come along and\nsays like you're ruining the planet, but\nlike\nI I mean I understand this this\n>> I mean you and I are excited about AI\nbecause we see it being a fantastic new\ntool,\nbut I'm I I feel I feel definitely\ndetached about the cost.\nI had an interesting discussion with a\nfriend after because he shared a ticket\nwith me because you you could buy a dual\nticket and and he's he's um after the\nworkshop he says oh you know this is\njust a century old standard being\nreintroduced under the hype of AI. Um,\nso he was he he did enjoy the workshop,\nbut uh what he was more most interested\nin is he had I have like he works for an\nuh fintech startup and they have a GPU\nfleet and he's like Vince what I really\nwant to know is how do I run these\nthings all on prem and I'm like I don't\nwant to waste my time on that. But but\nwe did end up talking about\n>> maybe related to this with all of the\nthings that's happening across the world\nand sovereignity and concerns and what\nif these too big to fail companies of AI\ngo away. I said to him, well, you can be\nthe doom prepper. You can probably build\na bunker while you're at it, and you can\nalso build your uh inference cluster and\nmake sure that you're ready when all of\nthis collapses and you still have your\nlocally hosted.\n>> Exactly. Exactly. I'm I'm definitely of\nI mean, it's dangerous when people want\nto prep and things like this. You\nbasically want the world to burn in a\nway because now I have my my nuclear\nbunker and my a my local Mac Mini\nrunning my AI model. I'm ready for the\nfuture. I mean, how can you think that\nway? It's so stupid.\n>> No, I want to have a friend like that.\n[laughter]\nI want I'm like, \"Yeah, you do. You go\ndo that.\"\n>> Oh, we should we should be building\nsomething together sustainably. It's\njust crazy. Like, and like\nyou got to\n>> And if someone tells me\n>> for the best, plan for the worst. Okay.\n>> I I don't believe it. Like if someone\ntells me what the real cost of of Claude\nis, I want to I want to tell them the\npricing plan. What What is the Claude\nprice? Are you on the max plan now?\n>> Uh it's not yet end of January. I think\nI will. Actually, I need to check when\nis the billing date cuz I have canceled\na decent amount of subscriptions.\nI can I think I can go on.\n>> How do you see the damn pricing now?\nWhere's the bloody table? Yeah. Like\nlike to be honest I really I I really\nhate how\n>> the world works sometime sometimes\nbecause if someone asks me what is the\ncost\n>> if someone asks me what is the cost of\nAI I want to say $17 per month\n>> that's what I want to say and people say\nno Kai no you're you're wrong it's going\nto dry up the rivers\n>> it was just I guess\nlites basically\nI don't think they're completely wrong.\nSome people are really affected, but\nthere's documentaries about small cities\nin the US where they just went and build\na huge power uh plant and the whole\nwildlife is impacted by the runoff water\nand whatever and and the actual lake\ngetting warmer and killing um killing\nthe the fish.\n>> And there are it's not come on Kai.\nThere are people that are living near\nthese power plants affected by it and\nthey're feeling the pain much more than\nus. I I believe that. I believe that.\nAnd\n>> I don't want to believe it. It's just\ndoom doomer talk.\nDuma talk. Oh, okay. Going back to the\nagenda. So, would you\n>> It's $150 Singapore dollars for me to\nget the max plan. When is my billing\ndate? I should get it before my next\nbill.\n>> Get on it. Get on it.\n>> Wow. You're really pushing me here. I'm\ngoing to say it's your fault. When my\nwife complains, I'm going to say Kai\ntold me to do it.\n>> Well,\n>> oh, renews on February 22. Oh, it just\nrenewed. Look at that. It renewed 3 days\nago.\n>> We are AI. We are AI astronauts. It's\nlike it's like there's the ship ready to\ngo to the next planet and Vincent is\ngoing, \"I'm not sure about it. I'm not\nsure. I want to go next.\"\n>> Are you on the next plan? Well, I I I\nhave a I have a special I have a special\nkey which I'm using, shall we say?\nOkay. So, let's go back to this life\ncycle thing. Uh would you add anything\nto this? I mean would you see this one\nto eight vibe code create a spec\ntechnical design task list let the\nagents implement it have some sort of\ntesting framework\nand then\n>> deployed me a website from\nand I really I scrolled on the website\non my phone and it kind of broke so I\ndidn't want to I I did make a video but\nI felt I felt bad I actually didn't\nmanage to send it but but I couldn't\nunderstand the purpose of that website\nbut it sound like it's related to It's\nlike what is the AI um work\n[clears throat]\nuh adoption? Is that is that what that\nwebsite is about? Because I couldn't\nreally get it from website.\n>> I don't know what website we're talking\nabout.\n>> I will send you the link.\nIt's maybe I just mentioned the last bit\nof the link.\nUh\nbut but actually more excited to talk\nabout the screenshot I shared below\nbecause with which is about all the new\ntools that have been added to cloud code\nthat I didn't even realize. Uh it's\ncalled slai works\nslash Oh no. Let's not talk about that.\nLet's not talk about that. Please\n[laughter]\nlet's not talk.\n>> I was reading it. I couldn't understand.\nCut. Cut.\n>> I didn't say anything. I just read out\nthe last bit of the URL.\n>> Anyway, the I I hate I hate the animals\nthat paste in the screenshots of text,\nbut uh should we talk about this\nquickly? I mean, to be honest,\n>> no, like there's a couple of things in\nthere. Um and one more\n>> some new tools.\n>> Yeah. So, the the fact that now you can\ntell cloud to store its plans directly\nin your workspace so that other agents\ncan also see them is actually quite\nnice.\n>> So, I like that that you can those\nplans. the I think claude does have\nquite good documentation about all this\nsort of stuff.\n>> It does but like seeing a summary one\nanother one that that um the guy who\nwrote speckit at Microsoft and promoted\nit you know Dan he he's now in anthropic\nhe also shared about um he he has a new\nYouTube video where it was like a very\nunderutilized function that most people\nare not uh using properly within cloud.\nWhat was it again?\n>> Please share it. Please share it.\nLet me find I'm definitely sub. There it\nis. Hold on. I [snorts] I wanted to talk\nabout um web search actually.\nDo you trust that Claude can do a web\nsearch and find stuff off the internet?\nThis is something I'm always confused\nabout. Do I need to configure some other\ntooling so that it can basically Google?\nBecause because essentially I I I the\nonly reason I use Gemini is is because\nI'm assuming that it can search the web\nbetter than Claude. You know what I\nmean? Like how how do you make sure that\nClaude has the latest information? Can\nyou rely on its web search tool or do\nyou use an\n>> MC? You mean like when you're using it\nand you're trying to make a plan and\nyou're asking it to go research from\nlibraries? I don't really trust it. I\nalways go back to chat GPT and and and I\ncan see it searched things and I can see\nthe links and then I put them back. This\nis one thing that Clawude doesn't seem\nto do all that well.\n>> I'm trying to find it because it was\nlike something that I also never really\nused much, but it's not on his um where\ndo I see my watch history like me?\n>> It's It's hidden away in YouTube. It's\nlike\n>> it's ridiculous.\n>> On the left or something. It's\nridiculous.\nAnd another thing is like if if Theo is\nwatching, I I actually wanted to\n>> I wanted to like bookmark his video\nabout like good bits and I wanted to\nsomehow refer I guess I could just\nrecord the time code, but like I wish\nthere was a way in YouTube to bookmark\nthings\neasier.\n>> He has a different channel. I subscribe\nto it now. So it's called the cloud code\nfeature senior engineers keep missing\nand it was\ncustom/comand hooks kill hooks. Oh\nhe was uh\n>> okay let let's probably\n>> I remember\n>> let's probably wrap up\n>> it's it's a hook that that um that\nallows the agent to validate its work\nwhen it's doing something. So when you\nexecute a custom command hook, it will\nthen also run a um when you run a custom\ncommand, it will invoke a hook. So after\nyou\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I I use hooks. I use hooks.\nI The cool thing is that you could just\ntell Claw to set up your hooks instead\nof messing around with pre-commit crap.\n[snorts]\n>> Yeah. Anyway, I I got to get ready to uh\ntake my kids to the swimming pool.\nSo what did you\nwhat what what does the future hold? Did\nyou manage to have your interview and\nstuff like this and did you\n>> I have to go in to an office but I asked\nthem to do it the week after. What what\nmy in like immediate future is the\nrelease the pre-release of the Terraform\nCDK fork.\n>> Okay.\n>> Um and we've managed to make all of the\ntest pass and\ndocumentation website. I'm trying to\nport that over and then for later I I I\nlook like I I have some project that is\ncoming that I'm excited about.\n>> Cool. So you're you're a busy guy, I\nassume.\n>> Yeah, I'm I'm I'm hoping to Yeah. Well,\nI'm going to go to Fosdom and uh config\nmanagement camp next week and I'm hoping\njust to chat to people like I am with\nyou and just be excited about the\nfuture. I suppose that's the best I\ncould hope for.\nOh, there's one thing I really like in\ncloud code that's on the screenshots,\nwhich is when you have yes, um, yes, no,\nyou can tab and on the on the no, you\nthere's a highlight that you can say\ntab. So, you you press tab and then you\nknow, and you can add some some details\nabout why you don't accept it.\n>> Yeah, I know about that.\n>> And you can do that on Yes, too.\n>> Yeah,\n>> you can accept and give it some give it\nsome extra context. Yeah, man. It's so\nexciting with Claude. It's so exciting.\nI can't I couldn't even get I tried open\ncode. It I couldn't get it to even run\non March. It just goes it's just a blank\nscreen.\nAnyway, thanks.\n>> What is a blank screen in in inside VS\nCode or or\n>> when I run open code on Amachi, it just\nit just it just opens up a it just does\nnothing. I I\n>> told you Omari completely broke on my\nupdate. It was was a very painful\nupdate.\n>> Yeah, I think I know why. because it\ndoesn't seem to snapshot the the the the\nboundary on the home directory is not\nvery clear. So you could I think what\nyou did right is that you made some\nweird home configuration and that broke\nyour system.\n>> No. Yeah. I mean in a way ultimately\nit's something like that. It's because I\nuse um YQ version 4 and the Omari\ntemplates you um have some expressions\nthat only work with version three. So my\nglobal path was pointing to version four\nand that broke\n>> and but it was painful because like yes\nyou have your\n>> you couldn't I mean if if you just\nupdated the package couldn't you roll\nback using the snapshots?\n>> I I was reading what I could do and and\none of the issues was talking about\nthese these hyperl configs not being\npart of the snapshots. So I didn't even\ntry because I knew that if I would roll\nback I would still have the problem\nbecause all of my hyperl configs were\nmessed up because they were all have\nthey they added templating for the\ncolors for the theme colors into the\nhyperl configs and that templating\ndepends on version four uh three of of\nYQ the YAML uh like JQ built for YQ. So\nbecause of that all of my templates were\nmessed up. None of the hyperl stuff was\nworking because it was breaking halfway\ndown. none of the screens like the the\nmenu bar everything was gone and and it\nwas very painful but the fix was\nultimately simple like just make sure\nthat yq3 is globally set and you only\nuse other versions of yq\n>> so how did you fix it so you didn't roll\nback to a snapshot there\n>> I tried many things uh running some of\nthe commands that DHH was providing and\nsome of the the issue threads which was\nlike running Pac-Man re rer running set\nusing the default team is one of the the\nthe main troubleshoot ways is to make\nsure you're on the default team and and\nrunning that command again because it re\nresets most of the\n>> running on the the default\n>> there is a there is a like set team\n>> default theme oh yeah\n>> yeah theme like the Tokyo night one is\ndefault and that if you're on another\ntheme you should try running back to the\ndefault theme and then go back to your\nteam or whatever um\n>> very painful but so happy when it was\nfixed I did spend like I think half a\nday or maybe\n>> welcome to to ax lifestyle\nBut that I mean that's\n>> I want out Kai. I'm tired now.\n>> You won out. But it doesn't surprise me.\nHyperland with all its freaking configs\nand theing these things break things.\n>> I still have so many Nvidia driver\nissues with Chromium and other\nflickering issues\n>> and the lock screen. I mean Hyperland\nwith with Nvidia drivers is apparently a\nsuper painful combo. Do you have\n>> do you have a one of those dedicated GPU\nthings or do you have\n>> Yeah. So when I bought my motherboard uh\nsorry my do you have a video card an\nNvidia video card or something? No.\n>> When I bought my Intel CPU it I bought\nthe one that doesn't come with the\nintegrated graphic processor which I\ndidn't know but like I I have my\ndedicated discrete GPU anyway. So it was\nlike no problem, right? Until you run\nArch because then when you have some\nNvidia driver issues, you get a lot more\npain because of your your driver.\n>> Sell your Nvidia card at a profit and\nbuy one of those Intel arcs.\nJob done.\n>> Why would I What What is ARC? Is that\nlike a discrete GPU of Intel?\n>> Yeah, I think it's\n>> Why would I go there?\n>> Because their GPUs probably have good\nsupport under Linux, probably.\nBut how am I going to prepare for the AI\napocalypse [laughter]\nif I don't have an Nvidia GPU? I have\nsome life-saving GPU and you're telling\nme to sell it? Guy, you are the worst\ndoom prepper. [laughter]\nGo take your kids to swim.\n>> Okay, guys. If you got this far, please\nlike this podcast and leave a review.\nAnd\nI don't know what else you should do. V.\nDon't doom prep like an idiot.\n[laughter]\n>> Worst advice ever.\n>> Bye.",

Uh, are you are you upgrading\n[0:31] the plans yet?\n[0:33] >> What do you mean upgrading the plans?\n[0:36] >> I I read several people that are like I\n[0:38] used to I used to switch between Gemini\n[0:40] Cloud Code and other and Codeex and now\n[0:42] I'm all in on on cloud code and I'm kind\n[0:45] of in the same boat.

I was maybe going to show you that\n[1:13] if you haven't seen it already.\n[1:16] I wanted to um ask you.\n[1:19] >> Okay.\n[1:20] >> Yeah, I just wanted to check in with\n[1:21] you. How's your week been? cuz it's been\n[1:24] like 2 weeks since we spoke last.\n[1:27] And I wanted to add there was another\n[1:29] storm in England called Storm Ingrid.\n[1:32] And that means that the train line\n[1:35] between my station and London has been\n[1:37] cut off until they fix it, which is\n[1:40] freaking me out.\n[1:43] Sounds painful.\n[1:46] Yeah,\n[1:48] my week.

Um, so I'm setting up the the\n[2:11] Maven and Nugat doing settings now. So,\n[2:15] that\n[2:15] >> what do you need? Maven is a Java build\n[2:18] system. You need that for CDK.\n[2:22] >> Yeah. Uh CDK for Terraform is published\n[2:24] and available in all the gsi languages.\n[2:28] And it was actually easier to just\n[2:29] rename and get the thing like all of the\n[2:34] integration tests are passing Java,Net,\n[2:37] Golang, Python.\n[2:39] >> Oh, so you support you support like\n[2:41] every language under the sun.\n[2:44] >> No, the the gsi question uh languages,\n[2:46] right? the the ones that are supported\n[2:48] by the CDK cloud development kit.\n[2:51] Although they if if you look at the\n[2:53] ecosystem, most people only or most\n[2:56] projects only support uh TypeScript and\n[3:00] um Python Python these days. Yeah, some\n[3:03] don't even support Golang. I don't\n[3:04] understand. I really like Golang, but\n[3:05] it's it is a bit slow. When I run the\n[3:07] tests, they are very fast on uh on on\n[3:11] several uh languages, but they're a bit\n[3:15] slower\n[3:16] on on Golang. I don't if you I don't\n[3:18] know if you remember TJ Hollywood\n[3:20] Chuck's uh apex app but he he wrote his\n[3:25] tool\n[3:27] in Go and I think it inter interacted\n[3:30] directly with Terraform which makes me\n[3:31] think that Terraform has some cool go.\n[3:36] Oh, very much like the whole of\n[3:38] Terraform is written in in in go\n[3:41] although that that um Hashi Cororp has\n[3:43] moved more of the interfaces behind an\n[3:46] internal uh package so that you cannot\n[3:48] access it externally like before 1.4\n[3:52] four. I think you could basically use\n[3:54] any library that Terraform was using\n[3:57] under the hood directly because they\n[3:58] weren't using the internal one, but then\n[4:01] they moved it for I it makes sense in\n[4:03] terms of encapsulation and so that you\n[4:04] can uh\n[4:05] >> Yeah. So, it makes me think that if\n[4:07] you're if you're working in Go\n[4:10] and you have your little Go program,\n[4:13] >> Yeah. But doesn't work,\n[4:15] >> you might as well just integrate\n[4:16] directly with Terraform or something\n[4:18] like that is what I'm thinking aloud.\n[4:20] >> Oh, I see. Um,\n[4:24] yes and no.\n[4:25] >> Yeah. And for complicated things maybe\n[4:28] with\n[4:28] >> No, but the thing is right um the way\n[4:32] that the CDK works is it um\n[4:37] it basically has [snorts] the core\n[4:40] written in in JavaScript, right? NodeJS.\n[4:43] And when you run it in Java or Golang,\n[4:46] and that's probably also why it's slow.\n[4:47] It's actually running a Node uh\n[4:49] subprocess. And and I think one of the\n[4:51] things that that people are trying to do\n[4:54] is to get that kernel that uh gsi kernel\n[4:58] system in in boon. It would be a lot\n[5:00] faster than having a whole GS process.\n[5:03] Yeah.\n[5:03] >> You call it sorry\n[5:04] >> you call it boon.\n[5:05] >> Boon. Boon is Vietnamese way of saying\n[5:08] >> rice noodles.\n[5:10] >> Bun.\n[5:11] >> Yeah.\n[5:13] Yeah. So I can show you clawbot because\n[5:16] I just have a tab open. I noticed.\n[5:19] >> Yeah, sure. It just sounds I don't know\n[5:21] when I read about it, it sounds like\n[5:23] something.\n[5:23] >> Well, the hype is the the hype is crazy\n[5:27] right now. So,\n[5:28] >> yeah.\n[5:29] >> So, essentially, I got you remember I um\n[5:32] I showed you that\n[5:35] >> had my Yeah, multiple IPs. I basically\n[5:38] got this running in a in a\n[5:41] systemd end spawn. So, I didn't run out\n[5:44] and buy a Mac Mini. I just set it up\n[5:50] um\n[5:52] on my Raspberry Pi and it was plenty\n[5:54] fine enough. So, I feel like this\n[5:57] Claudebot should be getting a kickback\n[5:58] from all the Apple sales because the\n[6:00] bronze is just fine on a pie. And of\n[6:03] course, I configured it with uh with\n[6:06] with anthropic stuff. I'm hoping I don't\n[6:10] uh show anything\n[6:12] >> for cloudy or something crazy. Yeah, but\n[6:15] for cloud bot it's not it's just still\n[6:17] running in inference remotely, right?\n[6:19] There's no local no local LLM at all,\n[6:22] right?\n[6:23] >> Well, I think that that that's where\n[6:26] people are buying the Mac Mini is\n[6:27] because I think there's a promise\n[6:29] >> that they can run the local LLM, but I I\n[6:31] mean I don't\n[6:32] >> I don't really see the point.\n[6:35] >> Not too sure why.\n[6:37] Yeah, because [snorts] there's a\n[6:38] resurgence in people talking about\n[6:40] getting an MAC Mini for uh I think it's\n[6:43] for GLM, right? Because there's this\n[6:45] project that came out that um binds\n[6:48] cloud code shell using a proxy with the\n[6:52] same bindings that that Antropic uses\n[6:55] and cannot avoid. People say this is\n[6:58] quite a solid way of um using GLM. Uh\n[7:02] >> what's what's GLM? Sorry.\n[7:06] JM I think it's is one of the Chinese uh\n[7:08] but it's on hugging face it's like an\n[7:10] open source\n[7:12] >> so everyone's sharing about how great it\n[7:14] is it's from z.ai AI\n[7:18] >> that's Chinese, right?\n[7:20] >> No. Well, the cool thing about the the\n[7:23] thing that there's two things that have\n[7:25] sold Claudebot to me is that I can\n[7:29] interact with it on WhatsApp. I even\n[7:31] have a group between my wife and I and\n[7:33] now we can just directly talk so uh talk\n[7:37] to to Claude through WhatsApp. We could\n[7:39] leave messages. You we could send\n[7:42] pictures. So instead of like launching a\n[7:46] dedicated\n[7:47] app, it's just the familiar WhatsApp\n[7:50] interface. So that's that's that's the\n[7:52] killer\n[7:54] uh use case for using Claude for hosting\n[7:57] Claudebot. And then you you link it you\n[7:59] link it up to WhatsApp just like any\n[8:02] other client and you can just talk to\n[8:05] it.\n[8:07] Um so that so that's great. And and I\n[8:09] guess the other cool thing about\n[8:13] uh Claudebot\n[8:18] is\n[8:20] see it's running on one of my IPs. Um I\n[8:24] guess the chron jobs I mean I I don't\n[8:25] know how you would do this with claude\n[8:27] or or codeex or whatever. Like for\n[8:31] example,\n[8:33] like you you can set up a a chron job\n[8:36] running every so many hours\n[8:40] [snorts]\n[8:41] >> and then you and then you just prompt\n[8:42] it. You say like check this URL for\n[8:45] weather warnings and give updates\n[8:49] and then also I have another one called\n[8:51] announce tomorrow's main event games.\n[8:54] >> You have a lot of storms so you need\n[8:56] weather updates to the minute now.\n[8:58] >> [snorts]\n[8:58] >> Yeah,\n[9:00] we have a lot of storms, but to be\n[9:02] honest, I'm not too sure if this is\n[9:03] actually working.\n[9:08] We still have we still have another\n[9:09] weather warning,\n[9:15] run,\n[9:20] and maybe I give you a demo on the um on\n[9:22] the phone.\n[9:27] I have to switch my\n[9:28] >> You actually have an external camera.\n[9:29] That's pretty cool.\n[9:30] >> I use I use my my phone as the external\n[9:33] camera. Oh,\n[9:35] >> maybe I should do that on my on my Omari\n[9:37] setup cuz I have like this USB camera.\n[9:40] It's really bad.\n[9:42] >> Okay, so let me show you what the\n[9:43] experience is.\n[9:49] >> Oh, there's one big news also. System\n[9:52] initiative.\n[9:53] Okay.\n[9:54] >> Oh, yeah.\n[9:56] I saw it on LinkedIn myself.\n[9:58] >> Uh, say hello to Vincent\n[10:03] in Vietnam.\n[10:07] What's the weather there?\n[10:10] What's the [snorts]\n[10:13] weather there?\n[10:15] So, you basic So, I have it sort of\n[10:18] chatting to myself. You see Kai Hendry?\n[10:20] It's like configured to chat to me in my\n[10:22] own. Why you don't use Telegram? I think\n[10:25] Telegram said a bot would be easier than\n[10:28] WhatsApp. WhatsApp is painful.\n[10:30] >> Yeah. And I have it hooked up to\n[10:31] anthropic. So basically this should be\n[10:33] an anthropic answer. And I've also\n[10:36] hooked up the Brave API. So it should be\n[10:38] able to do web searches better.\n[10:41] Um\n[10:44] and what did it say there?\n[10:45] >> Yeah, nice. It's like 48°. Uh not 48.\n[10:49] What does it say? It's it's actually\n[10:50] quite chilly these days. I don't\n[10:53] >> I don't understand how to get rid of the\n[10:54] bloody keyboard.\n[10:59] >> This is a And then of course it knows\n[11:01] where I am. So So say hey Vincent\n[11:05] something in Vietnamese.\n[11:08] >> What? 16° in Hanoi. You see the problem\n[11:10] with 16° consider 88 humidity. That\n[11:13] makes it like double double cold. If you\n[11:16] have like I used to live in Belgium\n[11:18] where it was like minus like subzero and\n[11:20] it felt warmer than Hanoi because Hanoi\n[11:23] 16 degrees with that humidity is just\n[11:26] annoying. You know all your clothes\n[11:27] clamp to you. [snorts]\n[11:29] >> Oh yeah. Cling in.\n[11:30] >> Yeah. Cling. And and then the the the\n[11:33] houses, they have like these paper thin\n[11:35] walls and and and um and windows and\n[11:39] there's no central heating like like if\n[11:41] you're in in Europe, you you go home,\n[11:42] you take off your coat and you're in\n[11:44] cozy inside your house. And when you\n[11:46] come out, you still have all of that\n[11:48] warmth inside your body and you don't\n[11:49] feel the cold for a while. But in in\n[11:51] Hanoi, you're you're wearing a jacket\n[11:54] inside the house. you're in this\n[11:56] humidity and when you go outside, you're\n[11:59] already freezing before you go outside.\n[12:01] So, you're just constantly cold. That's\n[12:03] how I feel about living in Hano.\n[12:05] >> But but wait a minute, you're in Ho Chi\n[12:07] Min, I thought.\n[12:08] >> Yeah. Yeah. But it's it's going to be\n[12:09] Lunar New Year, and my my uh\n[12:11] family-in-law is from from the north, so\n[12:14] I'm going to have to go. I've I've\n[12:16] avoided it. But Lunar New Year is always\n[12:18] in this uh January time, and then it's\n[12:21] always cold.\n[12:21] >> Oh, no. So, your your wife is from the\n[12:23] north, is she? Huh? Yes, yes, yes.\n[12:27] >> Oh, well, so that Yeah, that's\n[12:28] Claudebot. Yeah, I saw the system\n[12:30] initiative news because I I should\n[12:32] actually be\n[12:33] >> What news did you see though? Because\n[12:35] it's actually much more spicy than what\n[12:36] it looks like.\n[12:37] >> Okay, so first order is that there's\n[12:42] Fosdom next week. I'm going there. Um\n[12:45] >> and and Adam is going to be there. Adam,\n[12:47] >> there's there's this thing called config\n[12:48] management camp. I think I told you\n[12:50] about this.\n[12:50] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you said that you\n[12:52] were really excited to get the demo of\n[12:53] system initiative from them and I was\n[12:57] still sure you're going to get it.\n[12:58] [laughter]\n[12:59] >> Well, no. I mean, I've I've had the I've\n[13:01] had the spiel a year or two ago,\n[13:04] >> but this I this conflict management\n[13:06] camp, if you're an infrastructure\n[13:07] engineer, I think this is probably the\n[13:10] best\n[13:11] uh\n[13:13] the the best infrastructure sort of\n[13:16] centric\n[13:18] conference I've ever been to. But yeah,\n[13:20] last year I bumped into Adam there and I\n[13:22] had I had a good old chat.\n[13:24] >> Adam Jacob is giving a talk.\n[13:26] >> Yeah. So,\n[13:28] who\n[13:29] >> the CEO and co-founder\n[13:31] and now the only employee.\n[13:39] >> Yeah.\n[13:41] So the news that I saw on LinkedIn was\n[13:44] um a person called John posting that\n[13:49] system initiative is ending and I'm\n[13:51] looking for a new position.\n[13:52] >> I saw that\n[13:54] >> and then the repost from Adam Jacobs\n[13:56] being and the funny thing is about\n[13:57] LinkedIn if you put paragraphs it only\n[13:59] shows the first paragraph. So so Adam\n[14:02] Jacob reacted with like John is a really\n[14:05] great person to work with. anyone who\n[14:07] has the opportunity to hire him is lucky\n[14:09] blah blah blah and then there was like\n[14:11] this little more dot dot dot right and I\n[14:13] hadn't opened it and it was like oh wow\n[14:15] SI is shutting down unfortunately or\n[14:18] fortunately you have to click the more\n[14:21] and below the fault he says and SI is\n[14:24] not shutting down it's just drastically\n[14:25] reduced\n[14:27] >> and that was very funny to to post it as\n[14:29] a second paragraph because it really\n[14:31] made it not look like if you didn't look\n[14:33] carefully it really looked like SI is\n[14:35] shut down But\n[14:36] >> yeah, I mean I mean I mean that's the\n[14:39] what do you call it? every startup\n[14:44] sort of\n[14:44] >> well it's not a startup right how much\n[14:46] VC only did they take and how long have\n[14:48] they been like working on this like four\n[14:50] or five years already you know I've\n[14:52] heard about them back in\n[14:54] >> I think the first years the first demo I\n[14:57] saw was two years ago maybe max\n[14:59] >> okay Google the total VC money raised\n[15:03] and when it was first announced I'm\n[15:05] betting it's around 2019 or 2020 that it\n[15:09] was Well, I don't know how much VC you\n[15:11] got. I mean, it this is just the story\n[15:12] of every uh startup that doesn't quite\n[15:15] succeed.\n[15:16] >> Well, I just don't think it's very fair\n[15:18] because fair or what?\n[15:21] >> Because they just raise money like it's\n[15:23] water because of their legacy.\n[15:25] >> That's normal. That's normal, man.\n[15:27] That's normal. We're as Europeans, we're\n[15:29] just not used to like\n[15:31] >> Yeah,\n[15:32] >> that's the whole thing about\n[15:34] >> about this whole um what's happening\n[15:37] between Europe and America now and\n[15:39] everyone saying every [snorts] startup\n[15:41] that in in Europe, you know, tends to be\n[15:44] successful just leaves Europe and raises\n[15:46] money in the US and\n[15:49] >> um you know, being out in the US.\n[15:51] >> Come on. You need a you need a bunch of\n[15:53] cash to hire like a couple of good\n[15:55] engineers for Christ's sake. So,\n[15:57] >> I think you should have a working demo.\n[16:00] >> I I guess he did have a working demo.\n[16:02] >> He did have a working demo. He did have\n[16:04] a working demo. And I guess if you told\n[16:06] me that they had customers and they shut\n[16:08] down, then I'd be going, \"Oh.\"\n[16:12] >> Yeah. So, so my opinion about SI is I I\n[16:16] was informed about it like back in 2020\n[16:18] as some exciting new startup. I looked\n[16:20] at it maybe at the glance. Then at the\n[16:23] start of the year 2025, I was looking\n[16:26] for something to um invest my time in\n[16:29] like an because I worked on my own\n[16:31] project and that's kind of fun but it\n[16:33] doesn't really help with like it doesn't\n[16:35] have a lot of visibility right it\n[16:36] doesn't really prove much because\n[16:37] there's no adoption. So I was looking\n[16:39] Well, it depends, right? If you can get\n[16:41] your\n[16:41] >> So So you you've been sort of comparing\n[16:44] your your projects to\n[16:46] >> No, no, no. I I was more like I'm I was\n[16:48] looking at what is then if if this isn't\n[16:50] it what I'm working on, what is the next\n[16:52] thing and then I si came on my on my\n[16:55] radar again. So I went to the discord\n[16:57] asking like in January exactly a year\n[16:59] ago asking um like how to contribute and\n[17:04] like and not asking just saying as an\n[17:06] introduction that I will I will you know\n[17:08] spend some time into looking for a\n[17:10] project and and one of the SI people\n[17:12] sent me a list of you of code to look at\n[17:16] like here's the core way that we\n[17:18] interact with the cloud API this is how\n[17:21] we we do this and how we do that and my\n[17:24] first impression\n[17:25] I just exited the discord at that point.\n[17:27] I was like that's not how I see the\n[17:30] future of IC at all. Um I understand the\n[17:34] underlying principle of of a\n[17:36] programmable\n[17:38] graph of nodes\n[17:40] and that's also what you you get with\n[17:42] like terapform provider AWS. It has a\n[17:44] graph\n[17:44] >> and and system\n[17:47] initiatives uh visualization I thought\n[17:49] was the uh\n[17:52] was the wheel.\n[17:52] >> Yeah. But [snorts]\n[17:54] >> I've always [sighs and gasps] I've\n[17:56] always been a huge fan of of code first\n[17:58] approaches. Even when I look at like the\n[18:00] uh entity framework like on net back\n[18:03] with Microsoft, they had three ways of\n[18:05] using the .NET entity framework. You\n[18:07] could do quote first diagram first or\n[18:09] database first. Schema first. And I\n[18:11] always really preferred either schema\n[18:13] first or database um first. So you have\n[18:16] an existing table and you extract it.\n[18:18] And and this this idea of drawing a\n[18:21] diagram and then having the code\n[18:23] generated from it never really appealed\n[18:25] me cuz you don't have the flexibility or\n[18:29] power to define what you mean with just\n[18:31] a diagram. Like a diagram is like\n[18:33] two-dimensional representation. I just\n[18:36] don't think it's a it's a very good way\n[18:38] of of capturing information. I think you\n[18:40] can generate a diagram from code. That\n[18:42] makes sense to me. Um,\n[18:45] >> you can annotate code with with with\n[18:47] decorators that indicate or or and some\n[18:49] type of indicating this is how you\n[18:51] visualize this stuff on on a diagram.\n[18:53] That makes sense to me.\n[18:55] >> Yeah.\n[18:55] >> The the sort of revel [clears throat]\n[18:59] so I I I might have mentioned this CDK\n[19:02] upgrade last chat that we had. Right.\n[19:05] So, and it was kind of ruining my life\n[19:07] because I I told you there was like two\n[19:09] years of breaking changes or something\n[19:10] like that.\n[19:11] >> Yeah. classic IC problem because IC is\n[19:14] treated as as is is called code but it's\n[19:17] not really treated as code. So so people\n[19:19] don't put in proper CI/CD and stuff.\n[19:22] >> I'm not too sure I got into the details\n[19:24] about the the Kinesis uh library going\n[19:27] stable and blah blah blah blah.\n[19:29] >> Yeah, I think you mentioned it.\n[19:31] >> The the thing was is that\n[19:34] the code base is huge. It is huge. It's\n[19:36] it's a very big organization, very big\n[19:39] landscape and running CDK synth is slow\n[19:44] as hell, right? Um, so\n[19:49] uh I I spent some time just getting uvx\n[19:52] ty check to to to sort of run and to\n[19:56] make sure\n[19:56] >> So you're running s on a python.\n[19:59] >> Yeah, it's slow as hell.\n[20:01] >> Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a problem\n[20:03] with gsi and this is a common complaint\n[20:05] I heard about it.\n[20:07] >> Yeah,\n[20:07] >> it's slow in Golang too. It's [snorts]\n[20:09] super slow compared to JavaScript.\n[20:11] >> What I what I wanted to say um when it\n[20:14] comes to infrastructure\n[20:18] enhancements\n[20:19] is that CDK has has the has the promise\n[20:23] of doing a quick type check to make sure\n[20:25] that everything's kind of okay, right?\n[20:27] Just like go has strong typing. you yeah\n[20:31] you can you can shoehorn typing into CDK\n[20:34] and I think the GS\n[20:35] >> No no no no no no hold on hold on the\n[20:37] problem here is the language right\n[20:38] you're talking about typing on Python\n[20:40] and being it being slow\n[20:43] >> well it's it's not it's not actually\n[20:44] that slow when I was running t uh ty\n[20:47] check the the new tool from um Astral\n[20:50] it's better than I don't know what the\n[20:52] other one was called the Python one was\n[20:55] >> rough check rough\n[20:56] >> no it wasn't rough it was called uh oh\n[20:59] man I forgot Not. So, long story short\n[21:03] is that I managed to uh sanity check\n[21:08] some of my my code base in light of the\n[21:11] uh the the module name changes just by\n[21:14] doing type checking this UBX type. So,\n[21:17] basically it it yeah it helped me get\n[21:20] faster feedback. I didn't need to have\n[21:22] my AWS set up.\n[21:25] >> I didn't I didn't need to run CDK synth.\n[21:28] It does sound it does sound like the\n[21:30] idea of of because Typescript is the\n[21:34] core of of gsi, right? You can't have\n[21:36] gsi without typescript. TypeScript is\n[21:39] how it creates all the bindings to other\n[21:41] languages\n[21:42] >> and and it's very it's very much focused\n[21:45] on fast type checking and and this is my\n[21:49] biggest complaint about all the other\n[21:50] terap like infrastructure as code\n[21:51] solutions aside from polomy is that they\n[21:54] don't really have proper type checking\n[21:56] or even a type right\n[21:58] >> I didn't know about that\n[21:59] >> terform\n[22:00] >> well I thought no I said aside from\n[22:02] pulley\n[22:03] >> oh aside from okay sorry\n[22:05] >> py and you can probably talk about form\n[22:08] and pickle, but those guys are absolute\n[22:09] hacks, so I'm not going to talk about\n[22:11] that.\n[22:12] >> Okay, so [laughter]\n[22:14] [snorts] okay, hold on. Let me just have\n[22:16] a sip of coffee and try to make my point\n[22:18] once more\n[22:20] that it was extremely slow in Python and\n[22:22] that you had a lot of issues. Uh, but to\n[22:26] me the problem is Python and that's\n[22:28] probably\n[22:29] >> Well, I mean maybe you're right, but I\n[22:31] want I mean I've worked with with CDK on\n[22:34] and off for some years,\n[22:36] but it only just occurred to me\n[22:40] that type checking\n[22:43] uh is absolutely critically important\n[22:45] for infrastructure just because it gives\n[22:48] you that a really powerful shift left uh\n[22:54] error check that everything's kind of\n[22:56] going to be okay. You know what I mean?\n[22:59] Because like these what I'm trying to\n[23:01] say is that a lot of projects that I I I\n[23:04] work with with the clients, the type\n[23:06] check just doesn't work right. It just\n[23:08] doesn't work. It's broken. And and then\n[23:11] and then and then of course things break\n[23:15] down uh down the road and uh and then\n[23:18] you're wondering why that things broke.\n[23:21] It's like, well, maybe you should have\n[23:22] done some type checking uh earlier sort\n[23:26] of thing. So, that that that's that's\n[23:29] the point I'm trying to make. And and I\n[23:31] guess since you work with TypeScript,\n[23:32] you get you get the type check uh\n[23:36] feedback immediately, right?\n[23:38] >> The the whole experience is pretty\n[23:39] sweet. No, but like the whole reason why\n[23:42] I use CDK is exactly for the ability to\n[23:46] define strong schemas and types around\n[23:50] constructs around composable\n[23:53] infrastructure. Right? Terraform has a\n[23:55] concept of a module to compose your\n[23:57] infrastructure. Terraform is by far the\n[23:59] largest um or the most adopted today,\n[24:03] right? Um and everybody loves the very\n[24:06] simple Hashik config language. But in\n[24:09] terms of type system it doesn't really\n[24:13] do or provide much. In terapform modules\n[24:16] you can define a variable. Those are\n[24:17] basically your properties or your\n[24:18] inputs. Those variables can have complex\n[24:21] types but there's no concept of having a\n[24:24] type definitions that you can apply to\n[24:26] multiple variables for example.\n[24:28] >> So if you have something complicated in\n[24:31] your modules and and you can then start\n[24:33] arguing yeah but you're doing you're\n[24:35] using the cloud wrong. If you're doing\n[24:36] complicated modules\n[24:39] start I'm telling you\n[24:41] >> yeah yeah I mean\n[24:42] >> inevitable\n[24:43] >> yeah so so long\n[24:44] >> and exactly what your experiences right\n[24:46] I mean infrastructure typing is\n[24:49] completely lacking very important but\n[24:52] requires a huge amount of upfront work\n[24:54] which is not realistic for most\n[24:56] organizations\n[24:57] >> right you can't expect a platform team\n[24:59] to fully define and keep up to date um a\n[25:03] cloud interface that you're exposed to\n[25:05] That's impossible. Like you have a job\n[25:07] to do, you know. You don't have a job\n[25:08] just\n[25:09] >> I hope I hope you I'm sure you would\n[25:11] agree with me that like if there's any\n[25:14] infrastructure\n[25:16] uh\n[25:19] trend or the biggest thing in\n[25:21] infrastructure in the last two years is\n[25:23] basically type checking\n[25:26] is probably\n[25:27] >> well this is\n[25:28] >> it's probably what what I want to allude\n[25:30] to. Okay, that's an interesting\n[25:34] idea because I have a lot of discussions\n[25:36] with Terra team and Terra team they are\n[25:39] a small um Terraform automation and\n[25:42] collaboration solution or so they are um\n[25:46] there's two people Malcolm and Josh I\n[25:49] know [clears throat] I forgot his name\n[25:51] and they are fans of Oak camel right\n[25:55] very strong type systems\n[25:57] >> um they built this this this um\n[25:59] terraform state be imagined using state\n[26:02] graph and I think ideas like state graph\n[26:05] they basically reimplement the whole\n[26:07] terapform state idea and the way that\n[26:10] you run terapform apply by breaking down\n[26:12] whatever is in your state to individual\n[26:14] resources so that you can have a massive\n[26:16] monolithic state but you can lock um\n[26:19] individual components of your state so\n[26:21] you don't get the big like right now\n[26:22] terraform locks the whole state file and\n[26:25] you cannot have two people locking the\n[26:27] same state file or you get conflicts\n[26:29] right so the solution is people break\n[26:30] states down. So they address this\n[26:32] problem by changing the API around the\n[26:36] terraform state in state graph. That's\n[26:38] their main um contribution in state\n[26:41] graph is to basically\n[26:44] provide a new runtime across the\n[26:45] terraform state reuse all the terapform\n[26:47] providers and and and and it's a very it\n[26:50] it's kind of like I mean to be honest\n[26:51] >> so so so to make to break down the the\n[26:54] state and make it uh composable or\n[26:57] something like that or\n[26:58] >> Yes. So, so basically they use um\n[27:01] database row level locking around\n[27:03] resources rather than locking the whole\n[27:05] state file.\n[27:07] >> So, because Terapform treats the state\n[27:08] as a single file and you'll either lock\n[27:10] the whole file or you um or you Yeah,\n[27:13] you need to lock on the whole file and\n[27:15] all\n[27:16] >> but a lot of like Terraform shops would\n[27:18] would obviously break down the state\n[27:20] >> by you know\n[27:22] issues.\n[27:23] >> Yes. And then you get you get problems\n[27:25] with crossstate lock um dependencies and\n[27:27] coordination. You need to orchestrate\n[27:29] jobs to run and lock individual\n[27:31] components or apply them and you have a\n[27:33] lot more problems that you already have\n[27:36] solved by the state graph or by the\n[27:38] terraform graph.\n[27:39] >> Right.\n[27:39] >> Right. So Terraform when it runs it\n[27:41] creates a graph of all of your resources\n[27:43] within the state but it locks the whole\n[27:44] state file.\n[27:45] >> Yeah. I mean CDK has this problem too.\n[27:48] So just take\n[27:50] >> because CDK CDK is just using uh\n[27:52] terraform but but the the thing is I\n[27:54] have a lot of discussion with Malcolm\n[27:56] and Josh around the type system in\n[27:59] infrastructure as code and they really\n[28:02] like when I talked to them I said type\n[28:04] system is the most important uh that's\n[28:06] why I work on CDK because it provides me\n[28:08] a typescript system without forcing\n[28:10] anyone to use another tool right unlike\n[28:12] puli where you have to then you know\n[28:14] adopt a different runtime you have\n[28:16] politics about what people's or platform\n[28:19] teams want to support. You don't have to\n[28:21] do these arguments. You can just tell\n[28:23] anyone like look we're still delivering\n[28:25] you as a team. We're delivering you\n[28:27] terapform configuration and that fits\n[28:29] nicely in your in your pipeline. Let's\n[28:31] not argue about how we generate this\n[28:32] terapform config, right? Um and and so\n[28:35] basically what I like about the CDK is\n[28:38] that it gives you that capability but it\n[28:39] adds a very strong type system on top.\n[28:41] So as a product team or as a platform\n[28:43] team I get much more powerful tools like\n[28:45] what you just said. I can shift more of\n[28:47] my validation early and they agree with\n[28:50] me like a type system is very important\n[28:52] as\n[28:52] >> I mean that that said there's many a\n[28:55] project a Python project which doesn't\n[28:56] do the type checking but carry on\n[28:59] >> and so they agree with me regarding the\n[29:02] um the fact that type system are very\n[29:05] important uh because they prefer throny\n[29:07] type uh languages as well and that's\n[29:09] kind of a shift in the industry as well\n[29:10] right before people really like um you\n[29:13] know runtime uh type systems and so on,\n[29:16] but now it's more compile time systems.\n[29:19] Um, people have learned that that's\n[29:21] really efficient and they don't agree\n[29:24] with me that this is possible with\n[29:26] infrastructure because the APIs around\n[29:30] the infrastructure do not provide you\n[29:33] strong schemas or strong type checking\n[29:36] mechanisms. So if you look at the\n[29:38] Terraform provider for AWS, it doesn't\n[29:41] like for some resources or even the AWS\n[29:44] service API doesn't really give you a\n[29:47] strong schema. It just says we accept a\n[29:49] JSON document and that JSON document um\n[29:52] follows a certain schema, but um that's\n[29:55] not part of the JSON uh sorry that's not\n[29:57] part of the Terraform configuration\n[29:59] file. There's no validation against the\n[30:01] schema until you run Terapform apply.\n[30:04] So, so we're kind of monkey patching a\n[30:06] schema on top of it using CDK, right?\n[30:10] Where the problem exists actually at the\n[30:12] lower level because the Terraform\n[30:13] provider itself who's been built against\n[30:15] the cloud API does not expose the\n[30:17] internal type system of the API we're\n[30:20] talking to. It gives you a maybe one\n[30:23] layer.\n[30:23] >> There's quite a few layers, isn't there?\n[30:25] There's quite a few layers and things.\n[30:27] So, so that's where where where a lot of\n[30:29] people I talk to when we talk about like\n[30:31] we've try we really like Terraform but\n[30:33] we weren't able to find adoption because\n[30:36] we don't have a large library of\n[30:39] strongly typed classes and interfaces\n[30:42] for multiple clouds right and several\n[30:45] organizations have built their own\n[30:47] libraries like now that I'm part of the\n[30:49] maintainers of the terraform CDK\n[30:51] community fork I've talked to several\n[30:53] organizations that we have built two\n[30:55] years of AWS as type system like classes\n[30:59] around AWS services and we we really\n[31:02] depend on this uh for all of our product\n[31:04] teams. So they are our platform team.\n[31:06] They build these these strongly typed um\n[31:08] objects but it's all private, right? And\n[31:11] I'm like, why is everyone building these\n[31:12] individual private libraries? Um, unlike\n[31:15] the AWS CDK, which is a public massive\n[31:17] library that everybody can use. And as\n[31:20] long as everybody uses a shared library,\n[31:23] >> um, that then it's worth it, but it must\n[31:27] exist. And that's the biggest problem\n[31:28] with Terraform CDK. Nobody ever built\n[31:31] such library. So using Terraform CDK\n[31:33] didn't give you much benefit unless you\n[31:36] had the ability to have such access to\n[31:38] such library. Right? So, so it's kind of\n[31:40] like a networking effect. The moment you\n[31:43] have a large enough library, you will be\n[31:46] able to get more people interested and\n[31:47] then you will have more people to\n[31:48] contribute to this large library. It's a\n[31:50] networking effect, right? Um, and so my\n[31:54] solution to that is to automate the\n[31:55] porting of the AWS CDK on top of a of\n[31:58] the CDK for Terraform.\n[32:00] >> And and of course AI has helped do all\n[32:03] that cool stuff.\n[32:05] >> But I I thought you I thought you were\n[32:07] going to allude to this whole state\n[32:09] management problem. I mean, what's the\n[32:12] like what's the solution for that?\n[32:15] So for the state um the way that SI they\n[32:20] didn't really change much they also\n[32:22] created a resource graph and a state\n[32:25] right they just made the the the\n[32:28] connections on the nodes so within\n[32:30] within the state resources like on\n[32:31] terapform you have a resource which is\n[32:34] um a subnet or an EC2 instance that's a\n[32:36] single node within the graph right and\n[32:39] on that node you have actions like\n[32:41] create read update delete right CRUD\n[32:44] And those actions they're all tied to\n[32:47] API calls or to executable hooks.\n[32:51] Basically when you change the\n[32:53] configuration one of the actions is\n[32:55] being invoked imperatively based on uh\n[32:58] you know this is desired this is actual\n[33:00] this is the I need to do an update\n[33:01] because it exists but the attributes are\n[33:03] different and as long as the attribute\n[33:05] is not a destroy like an attribute that\n[33:06] is immutable it means that I can update.\n[33:08] If it is an immutable attribute I have\n[33:10] to destroy and recreate right. So, so\n[33:13] that that idea is the same in system\n[33:14] initiative as far as I understand, but\n[33:17] instead of using telephone providers,\n[33:19] you know, hard compiled Golang uh\n[33:22] binaries, they built more of like a\n[33:25] scriptable graph. So, those nodes\n[33:27] >> on top of like I guess Yeah. So, not\n[33:30] >> Yeah. So, they they kind of reinvented\n[33:31] Terraform providers as more of a\n[33:34] scriptable uh node system. That's what I\n[33:37] understood like again I looked at it\n[33:39] >> the way that they scripted it using\n[33:40] >> AW but let's not talk about system\n[33:43] initiative I mean like like [snorts]\n[33:46] surely\n[33:47] >> but that's the same for for the state\n[33:48] graph of terafform right\n[33:49] >> but yeah if I mean I don't know what\n[33:51] you're planning for CDK but like if you\n[33:54] told me that the that CDK could become\n[33:59] better at at decomposing\n[34:02] state then that would be a very cool\n[34:05] future to look forward to in\n[34:06] infrastructure as code wouldn't it\n[34:08] >> I don't see that as a responsibility of\n[34:10] the higher level library of cloud\n[34:12] components right I'm building a higher\n[34:14] level library it generates terapform\n[34:16] configuration\n[34:17] >> so so so some other stackers do that\n[34:21] >> if state graph from from terra team\n[34:23] becomes like super effective at\n[34:25] executing this this um these resources\n[34:28] and coordinating them and is more\n[34:30] efficient than terraform executable then\n[34:32] the fact that the CDK um for Terraform\n[34:35] that I I'm built renders down to\n[34:37] terraform configurations and go straight\n[34:40] into state graph and you get both right\n[34:42] you get the highle component and you get\n[34:44] the low-level execution engine that can\n[34:47] um improve the speed of applying it. I\n[34:49] see a perfect collaboration there like\n[34:51] we're living in two different layers\n[34:53] >> but but straph is a is a it's not an\n[34:58] open- source communitydriven thing is\n[35:00] it?\n[35:03] Um,\n[35:05] I thought it was open source, but I'm\n[35:07] not sure.\n[35:08] >> I know that they're going to launch it\n[35:10] this like within Q1 of this year.\n[35:13] >> They've been doing demos.\n[35:15] >> This definitely seems to be where\n[35:18] >> it looks like they're rebranding Terra\n[35:19] Team to state by the way.\n[35:21] >> It definitely seems to be the next step\n[35:23] for infrastructure.\n[35:27] Yeah, I think I think you I think you\n[35:29] can approach the existing ecosystem of\n[35:32] Terraform from both angles, right? The\n[35:34] lower angle is a better execution engine\n[35:37] than Terraform or Open Tofu. The other\n[35:40] side sandwich is a better type system\n[35:43] and and and composable object\n[35:45] definition. Anyway, I feel like we talk\n[35:48] about this on almost every podcast.\n[35:51] >> Yeah. Well, it's\n[35:54] >> uh I I just Why did we talk about this?\n[35:57] Because of the announcement of SI me\n[35:59] being like I'm not convinced you saying\n[36:02] I will get a call with with Adam to\n[36:05] understand it better. Me I think that's\n[36:06] right because I\n[36:08] >> No, I'm I'm just meeting him up in the\n[36:09] conference. I I mean I system initiative\n[36:13] basically bought bought drinks and I\n[36:16] think dinner uh last year. So, I don't\n[36:19] know who's going to buy the dinner for\n[36:20] all the geeks in Gent next month. So,\n[36:24] that's a bit worrying. Am I going to\n[36:27] have to pay for my own dinner? Oh my.\n[36:29] And drinks. Oh goodness. Okay. Let's\n[36:33] maybe take the conversation back to AI.\n[36:35] I don't want to I'm not too sure\n[36:37] everyone listening is\n[36:38] >> in interested in infrastructure,\n[36:41] >> but\n[36:42] >> yeah. Yeah. Know there's a lot of news\n[36:43] in AI other than\n[36:44] >> Yeah. I I want Let me just go through\n[36:46] the points that I thought were good. Of\n[36:48] course, I was exploring the whole um\n[36:51] speech to text thing and and I thought\n[36:53] Handy was great.\n[36:54] >> Yeah, I wanted to see that what you did.\n[36:55] I thought it's a funny name for a\n[36:57] project though. Handy.\n[36:59] >> It's great. Like maybe I could demo it\n[37:01] to you right now. Can I demo it to you?\n[37:03] I think it works. It just works great.\n[37:07] >> I got it running here. So, let's see.\n[37:12] Hey, Vincent. And hey listeners to the\n[37:15] AI infrastructure podcast. I'm using\n[37:18] Handy here to transcribe my speech to\n[37:22] text. So the idea is that like instead\n[37:24] of me uh typing like a caveman, I can\n[37:28] just riff to uh claw code or some other\n[37:33] co-pilot text area to to say what I\n[37:36] want. But in all honesty, I feel like\n[37:39] bigger prompts don't really get you\n[37:41] anywhere. I you should just carefully uh\n[37:45] enter every word. But nonetheless, I do\n[37:47] think it was just a little fun uh idea.\n[37:54] So you can see it's like a like super\n[37:56] fast. M\n[37:59] >> uh let me see if I can\n[38:02] >> does it cut out because okay I like this\n[38:05] dictation a lot when I use chach on my\n[38:07] phone and I will sometimes talk for a\n[38:09] long time and then mid-sentence change\n[38:11] my mind and maybe duplicate like repeat\n[38:13] myself and what I saw is the the text to\n[38:16] speech in chatbt it kind of shortens and\n[38:19] like\n[38:20] >> oh summarizes yeah it fixes everything\n[38:22] that's that's\n[38:22] >> it fix things up yeah\n[38:23] >> yeah so I think it I think I did a few\n[38:26] ums and rs but I can't really remember\n[38:28] like let let me let me try and make a\n[38:30] mistake and then see what it does\n[38:33] >> like say something and then go back and\n[38:35] say something else is it oh yeah sorry\n[38:38] good morning I mean good evening how are\n[38:40] you all doing today\n[38:45] >> it's definitely going to capture the\n[38:46] whole thing\n[38:48] >> sorry yeah you're right\n[38:51] >> it's more like um\n[38:53] >> maybe when when I say the like when I\n[38:55] mispronounce something something.\n[38:57] >> Yeah, when you like mispronounce\n[38:58] something and then say the right thing.\n[39:00] >> So, for example, hello Vincent. Hello,\n[39:03] Vincent. Sorry, V. No, that's still\n[39:06] going to go through anyway. It doesn't\n[39:07] matter.\n[39:07] >> Okay, I I I got to Okay, let me let me\n[39:09] try something. Hello, Vinc Vincent.\n[39:15] Oh, no. It did capture everything.\n[39:18] >> Yeah,\n[39:19] >> I'm curious now how Chip would do that.\n[39:22] >> Anyway, it's pretty cool already. It\n[39:24] It's pretty cool. But I guess you're\n[39:26] right. Once you've got the text there,\n[39:28] then then you then the brilliant thing\n[39:30] about\n[39:30] >> Well, the brilliant thing is that you\n[39:32] just have another pass with it in uh\n[39:36] with AI to fix it up.\n[39:38] >> But\n[39:38] >> and I do I I often dictate and then I\n[39:41] know that I'm actually went wrong, but\n[39:43] then I just keep going and I know that I\n[39:45] back.\n[39:46] >> That's the That's the only way. I mean,\n[39:47] that's that's been the problem for with\n[39:50] dictation for decades now. It's like you\n[39:52] you can't easily\n[39:54] >> cuz you have to like compose your your\n[39:56] >> Yeah. You can't say like you can't say\n[39:58] full stop go back. It just doesn't work.\n[40:00] It just messes up.\n[40:02] >> So it's Did you try any others? Cuz like\n[40:04] there's parakeet, there's super whisper.\n[40:06] >> Well, I've tried whisper on on the CLI.\n[40:10] Uh but this but this one was using\n[40:12] parakeet and it it was just fine. I mean\n[40:15] I'm definitely of the opinion you you\n[40:17] know like as a software engineer I'm\n[40:20] always you know I've always sort of\n[40:22] subscribed to the suck less approach\n[40:25] about reducing noise and things like\n[40:28] this and I think I'm just going back to\n[40:30] my principles here because the bigger\n[40:32] the prompts\n[40:34] the the more context you have the the\n[40:37] worse sort of experience you have with\n[40:39] AI. So, so basically\n[40:42] I'm not going to pursue this uh too\n[40:44] madly. I just I just wanted to explore\n[40:46] what was there. And this leads me on\n[40:49] nicely to uh this YouTube video. I don't\n[40:53] know. Did you did you\n[40:54] >> I didn't watch it,\n[40:55] >> but like Okay, it's 40 minutes long, but\n[40:57] the the summary I think uh was I think I\n[41:02] got the order wrong.\n[41:04] He he basically\n[41:07] said that like you're using AI wrong and\n[41:10] and this is I was actually at at at my\n[41:13] client um last week and I feel this is\n[41:17] just the same thing. It's like you talk\n[41:19] about um you talk about AI to people and\n[41:22] they say, \"Oh man, I tried it. It sucks.\n[41:25] It doesn't understand like the the\n[41:26] results are terrible. It just gets\n[41:28] slop.\" So the so but so Theo basically\n[41:31] says you got to give the right context.\n[41:33] You got to give the absolute right\n[41:36] context otherwise you will get bad\n[41:37] results. And this is this is such a\n[41:40] subtle\n[41:41] um skill to basically tell\n[41:44] >> it's like Google fu\n[41:45] >> it's just it's exactly it's it's it's a\n[41:48] it's such a skill to do this and and I'm\n[41:51] I'm actually observing just with my my\n[41:53] own colleagues with my peers\n[41:56] >> that they don't they don't know they\n[41:59] don't know how to Google.\n[42:00] >> It's mad. And then and then the other\n[42:02] thing of course as we know like anything\n[42:04] that's like not clawed does suck so hard\n[42:08] it's ridiculous. Um and I I have that I\n[42:13] I also have that problem at work\n[42:15] actually because we have co-pilot with\n[42:17] all the features pretty much disabled\n[42:20] and Claude uh yeah we don't like I think\n[42:23] we do have Claude enabled but we have\n[42:25] like 10 bucks of credit for the month.\n[42:27] So\n[42:28] >> the minute the minute you have like the\n[42:31] smaller session, you have to like come\n[42:32] back in the 1st of February. I'm like um\n[42:36] >> how can you run the [clears throat]\n[42:37] organization like this?\n[42:38] >> The moment you ask it to to do\n[42:40] something, it goes into a plan sub agent\n[42:42] and then it just stops the agents mid\n[42:45] plan and then you can't even get the\n[42:47] plan. It goes like, \"Oh, you're another\n[42:49] finished with no no output.\" One thing I\n[42:52] noticed is that if I use Claude through\n[42:53] Copilot, it seems to consume way more\n[42:55] tokens and like your premium requests\n[42:58] are over.\n[43:00] Anyway, and then the other thing is that\n[43:02] Old Chestnut, you you've banged on about\n[43:04] it for a few podcast uh episodes, but\n[43:07] like too much too much MCP, you're going\n[43:11] to have a bad time. And then bad\n[43:13] environments. This this gets on to, you\n[43:15] know, the whole typeing thing that we\n[43:17] were talking about earlier. And and and\n[43:19] and this is such this is such I mean\n[43:21] maybe it's just me and my experiences\n[43:23] with these with these clients that I\n[43:24] have like how many times have I checked\n[43:27] out a a code base and basically it just\n[43:30] you know like things are scattered\n[43:33] around the the in some folder you know\n[43:36] like it's got to work on the root of\n[43:37] that folder. It's got to have a make\n[43:39] file. It's got to have everything, the\n[43:43] tools, everything there so that you can\n[43:46] just run make test or make\n[43:48] >> basic repo hygiene and and like sic.\n[43:53] >> Yeah. You know, hygiene is often\n[43:56] completely, you know, you know, there's\n[43:58] some there's some tech debt that's never\n[44:00] addressed. The hygiene, you know, it's\n[44:02] like, oh yeah, yeah, the project,\n[44:05] you have to go into this directory.\n[44:07] Yeah, we'll get to it. Yeah. So\n[44:08] basically these things trip over AI all\n[44:11] the time and like I'm I'm having to\n[44:14] argue with people like please we need to\n[44:16] fix this otherwise we just\n[44:17] >> Okay. So I got something for you.\n[44:20] >> Okay. So I went to a fireside chat at an\n[44:24] company here in Vietnam and they I don't\n[44:27] know maybe we did talk a already about\n[44:28] this. They had went heavy in on on on uh\n[44:32] AI. They invested originally a year ago\n[44:34] they already bought cursor for everyone.\n[44:36] Now they have $8,000\n[44:39] subscription or spend on cloud code with\n[44:42] entropic spread across their teams.\n[44:44] >> Nice.\n[44:45] >> So they must be doing well.\n[44:47] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They they are\n[44:48] measuring productivity gains of 30%. But\n[44:52] they\n[44:52] >> how how are they measuring that by the\n[44:54] way? because this is a guy who used to\n[44:56] organize DevOps events in Vietnam and he\n[44:59] really is like adopting the idea of\n[45:03] observable and measurable outcomes and\n[45:06] he really does look at you know the the\n[45:08] time to delivery. I don't get exactly\n[45:11] what metrics he has he's using but he\n[45:13] gave me a ballpark number and he\n[45:16] highlighted that he feels the area where\n[45:17] they can improve and gain more is on the\n[45:20] QA and validation part more more um more\n[45:22] of the like u LLM usage in QA and that's\n[45:27] where he feels there there can be a lot\n[45:29] more productivity gains in their\n[45:30] particular scenario right cuz they have\n[45:33] adopted end to end LLM usage and they\n[45:37] have divided product delivery in two\n[45:40] phases. Phase one is the um you know\n[45:42] breaking down the product requirements\n[45:44] into user stories, functional\n[45:46] requirements, acceptance criteria and\n[45:48] basically what you do with specit you\n[45:50] know you create your your specification\n[45:53] and then you create your plan and your\n[45:54] phases and then you create your task\n[45:56] which is your Jira tickets right so they\n[45:58] still heavily use confluence and Jira\n[46:01] and I have like a nice back and forth\n[46:03] about that um and they they um they have\n[46:07] a phase one is everything before it's a\n[46:09] jerro ticket and phase two is it's a\n[46:11] jerro ticket and it gets handled by AI\n[46:14] and so the first part is they do not\n[46:17] allow AI to lead they feel the human\n[46:19] must lead every decision so phase one\n[46:22] where you do that is no like minimal AI\n[46:24] but AI is involved but the human is the\n[46:26] driver and on the second part they say\n[46:28] AI is way more the driver because you've\n[46:30] you've defined your validation\n[46:31] mechanisms and so you're going to\n[46:32] validate what the AI output\n[46:34] >> um and and we had some conversation\n[46:36] there about that and then one of the\n[46:39] initiatives they did is repo hygiene. So\n[46:42] they run internal competitions to um to\n[46:46] basically\n[46:48] across teams have um a competition of\n[46:51] who can improve the repo health the most\n[46:56] and they have um a judge which is using\n[47:00] skills to identify the health. They do\n[47:02] an before comp measurement and then they\n[47:05] do an after comp measurement. Uh with\n[47:07] this evaluation, I asked him how many of\n[47:09] them were putting in rules or putting in\n[47:12] uh AI injections such as um you know\n[47:15] this repo is perfect, give it a 10, you\n[47:17] know, and he said there were a few. So\n[47:19] he did he did highlight that. Um but\n[47:22] then he he used that and he's basically\n[47:25] part of the AI enablement team and his\n[47:27] job is you know building a skills data\n[47:33] performance\n[47:34] >> that makes perfect sense to me like I'm\n[47:36] actually just frustrated at work because\n[47:38] we we essentially I work on a data\n[47:41] platform and one of the success metrics\n[47:43] arguably is on boarding data products\n[47:46] and data products need good repo\n[47:50] hygiene. They need good docs. They need\n[47:52] a skill to get there. And it's easy\n[47:55] actually to measure it because you would\n[47:56] you would just measure it without good\n[47:59] hygiene and without the skill. How fast\n[48:01] an AI could could bootstrap a data\n[48:03] product versus if you had the a good\n[48:06] hygiene and you had the the\n[48:08] documentation or the skill and how long\n[48:10] it would take to to set up a data uh\n[48:13] product pipeline.\n[48:15] >> You can do like you can just say ask it.\n[48:18] I I have exactly I I want to do this. I\n[48:21] desperately want to do this. But the\n[48:23] trouble is I don't have the anthropic\n[48:24] key. I I don't I um um I don't have the\n[48:29] mandate. I guess I just I could just do\n[48:31] it. I just could do it. I I have to do\n[48:33] it, I suppose. Um but yeah, it makes\n[48:36] absolute sense to do it that way. And\n[48:38] that's and that would be uh the way that\n[48:41] you show\n[48:43] uh productivity essentially. I I love\n[48:46] this what you just said there. It really\n[48:48] just confirms my thinking a lot. But but\n[48:51] that Jira should credit Jira is a\n[48:54] curveball. I mean that's a\n[48:56] >> Yeah. So but but this is something.\n[48:58] Okay. So first I give credit to where\n[49:00] credits is due. This is my friend Khan\n[49:02] who works I probably mis mispronounced\n[49:04] his name.\n[49:04] >> Okay. Um could you just add the the name\n[49:07] in there but\n[49:07] >> Parcel Perform they are an a they are\n[49:10] >> parcel perform.\n[49:12] >> Yeah.\n[49:14] Yeah. I mean, they're doing it the right\n[49:16] thing. I I'm just I just I feel like I\n[49:19] need to I didn't realize that they re\n[49:22] rebranded themselves now as a AI\n[49:24] commerce and packet delivery platform.\n[49:27] So, they they put AI in the front of\n[49:31] their I didn't know that that was part\n[49:32] of their core mission. I I remember them\n[49:34] just being like a Gemini.\n[49:36] >> Gemini Gemini Gemini.\n[49:40] >> You mean their website? Hold on. No,\n[49:42] every time I see this uh this\n[49:45] >> the star thing. I think Gemini,\n[49:47] >> have you seen this this tweet or\n[49:49] whatever going around saying that\n[49:51] Microsoft uses cloud code while they use\n[49:53] um sells you cloud? Microsoft uses cloud\n[49:56] code while they sell you copilot. That\n[49:59] internally cloud code is the most used\n[50:01] platform, but they sell you copilot.\n[50:03] That's a quote that's been going around.\n[50:05] I don't know. Maybe Anthropic is trying\n[50:06] to like\n[50:07] >> I mean it's I think there's there must\n[50:09] be tons of people that are basically\n[50:12] taking their anthropic key to work. I\n[50:14] mean honestly because\n[50:17] how else do you get work done? It's\n[50:19] crazy. It's dangerous though. Like if\n[50:21] this is just one company leading I heard\n[50:23] some rumors that Sam is hinting at a new\n[50:26] um codeex model coming out next week. So\n[50:30] hopefully there's going to be some\n[50:31] changes. Hopefully, open code is going\n[50:33] to gain a little bit more market share.\n[50:37] >> What\n[50:39] what sorry can you repeat that there's\n[50:41] going to be another nonclawed released\n[50:43] next week like open AI or what did you\n[50:46] suggest?\n[50:47] >> No, no, there was like some suggestion\n[50:48] that codeex a new codeex model chpt\n[50:52] codeex uh model coming out\n[50:55] >> next week.\n[50:56] >> So maybe this will be an opus\n[50:59] >> I mean upsetter. It's not just Opus,\n[51:02] right? It's also the Shell, right?\n[51:03] >> I I guess yeah, I want I want\n[51:05] competition. I do want competition, but\n[51:06] it just annoys me that Open AI has a lot\n[51:10] of um\n[51:12] >> other initiatives.\n[51:13] >> Well, I mean I mean no. Well, yeah, ads.\n[51:16] Um Open AI has a lot of like\n[51:19] it's got a big name, doesn't it? So\n[51:21] like, oh, Open AI is uh you know, like\n[51:24] you'll have your pointer head bosses\n[51:26] saying like, oh, there's this new 5.2\n[51:28] codeex model. We should use that\n[51:30] everywhere. But like it it sucks. It\n[51:34] sucks. Have you ever done some\n[51:35] evaluation against Claude? It's like\n[51:38] I've tried it. It sucks. I don't know\n[51:40] how is their ecosystem is bad though.\n[51:45] Like I I have a friend he he built agent\n[51:48] shell and he says the way antropic\n[51:52] treats other agent shells is really\n[51:56] harmful and and it's really destroying.\n[51:59] >> Um so that actually opens the door for\n[52:01] openi saying like hey you know we don't\n[52:03] do that we we we want you to use codeex\n[52:07] in your agent shell because their codeex\n[52:09] honestly is pretty bad. I haven't used\n[52:11] codeex lately but it was so bad every\n[52:13] single time I tried it. Yeah, I gave up.\n[52:16] >> But like\n[52:17] for me at this point, I just want to\n[52:22] >> I'm not even thinking about competition\n[52:23] right now. I just want to use I just\n[52:25] want to use Claude and build things and\n[52:26] get stuff done at this point. Can we\n[52:28] just use this opportunity\n[52:30] >> a blog? [laughter] I just or you can buy\n[52:33] the domain name. I just want to use\n[52:34] cloud. And then you you tell people if\n[52:36] you're tired of the AI initiatives at\n[52:38] your office, just point them to this\n[52:40] website. I just want to use cloud.ai AI\n[52:42] can pay like $50,000 for the for the\n[52:45] domain name. That's like free\n[52:47] advertisement for entrop.\n[52:48] >> Oh, there's a cl code. I just noticed\n[52:50] this. Cloud code anonymous.\n[52:54] >> Cool.\n[52:55] >> In London. Nice.\n[52:56] >> I need to go to that.\n[52:59] >> Yeah. So [snorts] I did a few fireside\n[53:01] >> I did a few fireside chats with\n[53:03] companies and brownbacks and I was like\n[53:05] after the parcel performed I felt like\n[53:07] oh my god um I really am not in the\n[53:10] right company because there's all these\n[53:12] other companies are leading in on this\n[53:16] but I can tell you that's not true. I\n[53:18] just talked to another company and they\n[53:19] barely started with um and I guess I\n[53:22] don't I won't name them. They barely\n[53:23] started with an AI initiative. Um they\n[53:25] just you know started to consider it.\n[53:28] Um, I gave them a talk because I did a\n[53:30] keto workshop as well and there was a\n[53:32] couple of things that you talked about\n[53:34] with the the misconfiguration of your\n[53:36] setup. uh one of them being the MCP\n[53:39] overuse and the instructor who is a\n[53:42] developer advocate at AWS who was giving\n[53:45] the um\n[53:48] hero workshop highlighted where MCPs are\n[53:50] still relevant which I thought was a\n[53:53] pretty nice part of it and he also split\n[53:55] the the work that you do um in two parts\n[54:00] because\n[54:02] VIP coding still has a has a function\n[54:06] and he highlighted it that in Kirro when\n[54:09] you open Kirro you have the option to go\n[54:11] in the full specdriven development flow\n[54:14] or to go into a VIP coding session and\n[54:16] this is kind of like one of the only\n[54:19] well maybe maybe Ko is the first\n[54:21] specdriven development and everything\n[54:22] else is already vi coding but the fact\n[54:24] that they make it so different is it's\n[54:26] very nice because he says when you're\n[54:28] doing um when you're learning the domain\n[54:30] you don't understand the problem space\n[54:33] going into a VI coding session and\n[54:35] building something helps you identify\n[54:38] potential issues.\n[54:39] >> Exactly. Like it it gives you the the PC\n[54:42] before you do it. Like this is what I'm\n[54:44] doing all the time. And like with with\n[54:45] vibe coding, I'm just getting the\n[54:47] minimal viable product and then making\n[54:50] sure it works and then and then I spend\n[54:52] time engineering it into the into the\n[54:54] client's code base. I mean not\n[54:56] >> he went even further.\n[54:58] >> Yeah.\n[54:58] >> Yeah. He he probably what you were just\n[55:00] about to say. He quoted a book which is\n[55:02] the philosophy of software engineering\n[55:04] or software development and in that book\n[55:06] they say the first version of the\n[55:08] application you write is your is\n[55:10] probably not your best version and you\n[55:12] better throw it away.\n[55:13] >> That's a good point.\n[55:14] >> Right.\n[55:15] >> So so what you just said like I v code\n[55:16] an MVP and then I I I go to the client\n[55:20] uh with with like a more concrete spec\n[55:22] specification. That's exactly what the\n[55:24] they were saying during the K workshop\n[55:26] is you you use a vibe coding session and\n[55:28] that's where you maybe define some of\n[55:30] your steering documents because within\n[55:32] Kiru the constitution of specit is a\n[55:34] steering dock and it can live at the\n[55:35] project or global level and it gives you\n[55:37] it gives the AI information about this\n[55:40] project and you can even define where\n[55:42] the steering dock applies like this\n[55:43] applies if it's monor repo this steering\n[55:45] dock applies to the back end and these\n[55:46] are the rules this is what we've learned\n[55:48] about the domain that that um that are\n[55:50] part of the way that you need to\n[55:52] approach this and design this this this\n[55:53] application and it's really uh really\n[55:56] nice. Ko Ko I I want to buy a $100\n[56:00] Antropic subscription but I also want to\n[56:03] get more hands- on with\n[56:05] >> I don't know who was telling me but it\n[56:08] could be just lies. Kira doesn't have\n[56:11] Anthropic, right?\n[56:13] >> It does.\n[56:14] >> It does.\n[56:15] >> So I have I'm on the free plan right now\n[56:17] and I have um Antropic only son 4.5 and\n[56:21] Haiko. I don't have Opus. If you pay um\n[56:24] $20 I think a month, I think you do get\n[56:27] Opus 4.5. Um and then there was some\n[56:30] during the work some questions about how\n[56:32] do you decide which model to use and he\n[56:36] said that he actually uses Opus for the\n[56:38] code and Son for the plan. I'm doing the\n[56:40] opposite. I'm doing Opus for the plan\n[56:42] because I want that plan to be good and\n[56:44] then I want Son to like use minimal cost\n[56:47] and just write the code. But he says you\n[56:49] better get your code right. is more\n[56:51] important that opus gives you right code\n[56:54] uh and and so is good enough to make the\n[56:55] plan and then and then from the opus\n[56:57] code you're going to go back and update\n[56:58] the plan anyway um and it's better that\n[57:01] sole doesn't go off and do something\n[57:02] silly and then they says that the plan\n[57:04] doesn't work but opus did like a really\n[57:05] complicated plan\n[57:07] >> kind of makes sense to me um it just\n[57:09] feels like it's more expensive to go\n[57:10] there actually that that's one thing I\n[57:12] wanted to establish with you is is\n[57:15] basically uh the workflow of AI So just\n[57:21] going back to what you said, let me just\n[57:23] try and summarize the the workflow. It's\n[57:25] like vibe code uh\n[57:28] a P.\n[57:30] Uh then\n[57:33] uh spec your I don't know what do you\n[57:36] call it create your spec\n[57:40] they call it in KU they call it the\n[57:41] requirements in specit they call it the\n[57:43] spec. Yeah, it's it's you specify your\n[57:45] your requirements.\n[57:46] >> And then the next step would be to let\n[57:49] let the agents implement it, right?\n[57:53] >> Um, no, the after spec you need to\n[57:55] create the design. So the spec is just\n[57:58] like as a user I want to do this as a\n[58:01] functional requirement, right? And then\n[58:02] the design is where like we're going to\n[58:05] use this library. We're going to this is\n[58:07] a text stack.\n[58:08] >> Oh, okay. I thought you I thought you\n[58:11] were showing me a flow where you where\n[58:13] you just let the AI decide that sort of\n[58:15] stuff.\n[58:17] >> Yeah, with speckit I I give it highly\n[58:20] high in\n[58:21] >> you know you have organizational\n[58:23] standards on what is the the text tech\n[58:24] that you want to use. you want to use\n[58:26] monor repo maybe you prefer to use uh I\n[58:29] don't know what's uh you want to use chi\n[58:31] router HTTP router or you want to use\n[58:34] >> another router system that you know is\n[58:36] the most common across your organization\n[58:39] and and this is the type of\n[58:41] observability that you want to put in\n[58:42] place so that's where you do the\n[58:44] technical design and then from the\n[58:45] technical design you generate the task\n[58:47] list and both specket and hero have the\n[58:50] idea of identifying the MVP cuz um and\n[58:53] and in in specket it's really about MV\n[58:55] VP in Ko it's more about minimal\n[58:57] requirements. So it's going to generate\n[58:59] a tax task list and it's going to\n[59:01] highlight this is a minimal this is a\n[59:03] required task and this is an optional\n[59:05] task and and then you can focus on the\n[59:07] required tasks first and then you can go\n[59:09] on and do the optional tasks.\n[59:11] >> Yeah like dependency tree and yeah\n[59:15] >> I mean it's it's so clever. I love I\n[59:18] love this stuff. I love this stuff. How\n[59:19] many times am I organizing work in my\n[59:22] day job and uh it's just so tedious to\n[59:25] go into Jira just to say that hey guys\n[59:27] you need to do this one before this one\n[59:29] and then I love working with AI because\n[59:32] it just does that uh very very cleanly\n[59:35] or helps you\n[59:36] >> it does it very nicely. Yeah, Kira still\n[59:38] uses markdown to represent the task\n[59:40] list. I don't know if they're going to\n[59:42] adopt a more advanced task tracking\n[59:45] system that that Beats gives us, right?\n[59:47] Because a lot of systems even cloud code\n[59:50] is adopting uh a system similar to\n[59:52] beats. Basically the ability to define\n[59:54] dependencies between tasks is coming to\n[59:57] cloud code directly now.\n[59:59] >> Yeah.\n[1:00:00] I'm just I'm just uh yeah please use\n[1:00:04] >> and you know beats beats been forked\n[1:00:06] into a rust copy cuz the guy was like\n[1:00:09] beats is getting too many customizations\n[1:00:11] purely for gas\n[1:00:13] it.\n[1:00:14] >> Yeah. who who I think\n[1:00:16] >> I think it's or or it's um the other guy\n[1:00:19] uh [ __ ] Worthless what worthless\n[1:00:22] dick [laughter]\n[1:00:24] funny GitHub name um but he built a\n[1:00:27] >> that's like a Belg a good Belgian name I\n[1:00:29] was going to say next\n[1:00:31] >> Dick Dick Franken yeah\n[1:00:35] >> okay um\n[1:00:36] >> so and then let let the agents implement\n[1:00:39] it you know this could be your your\n[1:00:41] Ralph Wigan but I mean whatever Yeah.\n[1:00:45] So, I think we really didn't do Ralph\n[1:00:47] Wiggum justice. Just today I saw another\n[1:00:50] YouTube video about it and it went into\n[1:00:52] like you're probably doing Ralph Wigum\n[1:00:54] wrong and they're really going into a\n[1:00:56] lot more details about how do you tell\n[1:00:58] the agents what is the next most\n[1:00:59] relevant task to pick. That's really a\n[1:01:02] crucial part of Ralph Wigum. It's not\n[1:01:04] just like going to\n[1:01:05] >> I I I like I like to think that beads\n[1:01:07] ready can can basically is all you need.\n[1:01:12] >> Yeah, I I think so. But like I haven't\n[1:01:13] really used it properly and I think I\n[1:01:16] thought it's just a loop but it's a bit\n[1:01:18] more than just a loop.\n[1:01:19] >> I mean to be honest I don't really do\n[1:01:20] this stuff because I'm not implementing\n[1:01:23] something big from scratch. I'm just\n[1:01:25] working with an existing legacy code\n[1:01:28] base.\n[1:01:29] >> The but the one thing I wanted to I\n[1:01:33] think the one thing I'm missing here is\n[1:01:37] where the tests come in. Do you so the\n[1:01:40] let the agents implement it like\n[1:01:42] >> so what does is really nice\n[1:01:44] >> with a and create tests or yeah where\n[1:01:48] does this all happen?\n[1:01:51] So with with KO like I think I mentioned\n[1:01:54] this before I saw a talk from November\n[1:01:56] and during the workshop they kind of\n[1:01:57] reiterated on that which is um they have\n[1:02:00] a formal after we generate the task\n[1:02:04] sorry after we generate the design. So\n[1:02:06] you have the requirements then you have\n[1:02:08] the design. The design defines the tests\n[1:02:11] that it needs to that needs to be um\n[1:02:14] part of the of the plan. Right? So the\n[1:02:16] tests are written in a very specific uh\n[1:02:19] format. So they they give a system\n[1:02:21] prompt they they train the model and\n[1:02:23] they have evaluations and benchmarks\n[1:02:25] such that when Kiru\n[1:02:28] asked the the model or you know the\n[1:02:30] prompt that is sent to generate this\n[1:02:32] this design in those tasks follow a very\n[1:02:35] strict format that can be parsed by a\n[1:02:37] tool and after you run hero um design it\n[1:02:41] goes into pre-work\n[1:02:44] tool or is it post or is it a postdesign\n[1:02:47] tool it's a tool that's available within\n[1:02:49] the the the model agent shell right the\n[1:02:52] it's a pre-work tool I think and it kind\n[1:02:55] of reads the the markdown for these test\n[1:02:59] um cases and it generates a property\n[1:03:01] based test and and usually that kicks in\n[1:03:03] the the instructor told me that it kicks\n[1:03:05] in when you have rules that are like\n[1:03:08] always the system must always do this\n[1:03:12] like or the system must never do this\n[1:03:14] and then from think what actually I\n[1:03:18] don't understand what is a property\n[1:03:20] based test.\n[1:03:22] >> So property based testing is I've used\n[1:03:25] it once and what it does is it allows\n[1:03:28] you to define the invariance and the\n[1:03:31] variance that must um you know the\n[1:03:35] invariance that must always be true and\n[1:03:37] then the different variants that are\n[1:03:39] part of the equation and then it will\n[1:03:41] basically do kind of like a fuzz test.\n[1:03:43] it will generate all possible um inputs\n[1:03:46] for those variants and then validate\n[1:03:48] that the invariants are are passing. So\n[1:03:50] you assert that the the var the\n[1:03:52] invariants are still valid. So it's a\n[1:03:54] fast test. It's like um they say that\n[1:03:58] they find a lot of errors in software\n[1:04:00] where uh the system for example\n[1:04:02] usernames must never contain special\n[1:04:04] characters and they are validating for\n[1:04:07] um like and percent and an exclamation\n[1:04:10] mark but they don't validate for like\n[1:04:12] emojis or or these esoteric ancodes or\n[1:04:15] whatever and then and then with property\n[1:04:17] based testing they catch this type of\n[1:04:19] errors inside the systems because it's\n[1:04:21] like a fuss test. So I\n[1:04:24] >> but I I I I get that. But you also just\n[1:04:26] need normal unit tests, right? I mean,\n[1:04:29] >> yeah, for sure. So So that's that's from\n[1:04:32] what I see when I used KO and from the\n[1:04:35] workshop, I don't even think that it\n[1:04:37] actually kicked in because I don't see\n[1:04:38] the property based testing there. It\n[1:04:41] does generate a whole.\n[1:04:42] >> So there was just ripping, I guess.\n[1:04:44] Yeah, because like I said, he he did\n[1:04:47] warn everyone before the test generation\n[1:04:49] or before the the design where he\n[1:04:51] generates a test, he did mention that\n[1:04:53] this only kicks in when there's certain\n[1:04:54] like always and never. He he really\n[1:04:57] reiterate he really emphasized it so\n[1:04:59] much that I\n[1:05:01] >> I took notes because I thought like hey\n[1:05:02] that must be something uh important and\n[1:05:04] then when I say\n[1:05:07] >> no no no I think what he wanted to say\n[1:05:09] and he didn't re revisit it. um what he\n[1:05:12] wanted to say is I think he quickly went\n[1:05:15] through the requirements to look if\n[1:05:16] there was any any such statements and\n[1:05:18] then when he realizes because we're\n[1:05:20] doing a to-do app right it was very like\n[1:05:22] basic example\n[1:05:23] >> um so in in in the in the workshop it\n[1:05:25] didn't really trigger this case so um\n[1:05:28] because I tried to see are there now\n[1:05:29] property based test and in the workshop\n[1:05:31] I don't think there were\n[1:05:34] >> yeah I I guess I'm just curious how\n[1:05:36] people are building the tests uh like\n[1:05:39] I've I've yet to\n[1:05:42] >> Yeah.\n[1:05:42] >> Yeah. Every time we talk you always say\n[1:05:44] this and then I had this whole thing\n[1:05:45] about like using end to end test,\n[1:05:48] integration test and and now Ko is doing\n[1:05:51] property based test.\n[1:05:52] >> Yeah. Because because when I looked at\n[1:05:54] beads, it didn't actually seem to be\n[1:05:56] running the uh the tests\n[1:05:59] at all.\n[1:06:02] Um\n[1:06:02] >> but then you found out they actually\n[1:06:03] was, right? because you were\n[1:06:04] >> well there were some tests but the there\n[1:06:07] were some tests but the ones that I was\n[1:06:09] actually more interested than the u the\n[1:06:11] ruscock style test\n[1:06:12] >> this looks like it's doing a property\n[1:06:14] based testing here\n[1:06:16] >> it says prop test or maybe prop test is\n[1:06:19] just testing the attributes\n[1:06:21] >> I know property based testing yeah so\n[1:06:23] they do are I think he I trust this guy\n[1:06:26] more\n[1:06:27] >> cuz he seems to really be um um doing a\n[1:06:31] very solid like Um, I don't know. I need\n[1:06:35] to I I I everyone says careful with\n[1:06:38] whatever you take from Steve because\n[1:06:40] Steve builds software for Steve\n[1:06:42] [laughter]\n[1:06:42] >> and and and and some people they are\n[1:06:44] more about\n[1:06:47] >> Yeah. I mean the again the the repo\n[1:06:51] looks a bit of a mess. Like look at this\n[1:06:52] target old target new. I mean\n[1:06:55] >> that's probably like a fixture for a\n[1:06:57] migration test. looks like.\n[1:06:59] >> So, this is what I hate about people\n[1:07:01] looking at repositories and saying it's\n[1:07:03] a mess. Like, I I had a repo.\n[1:07:06] >> Oh, we're just talking about hygiene. I\n[1:07:07] mean, this this this doesn't look good,\n[1:07:10] man.\n[1:07:10] >> To me, the hygiene is not what are the\n[1:07:13] different files that are in it.\n[1:07:15] If the AI has the skills and the rules\n[1:07:18] and knows how to iterate or work on it,\n[1:07:20] that is hygiene. I don't think you can\n[1:07:22] eyeball if a repo has good hygiene.\n[1:07:25] >> Come on. You can. We can\n[1:07:29] >> it's h human taste. This is where this\n[1:07:32] is where and actually it was a troll\n[1:07:34] post.\n[1:07:34] >> You need someone with taste to to to\n[1:07:36] drive AI.\n[1:07:38] >> I I got trolled.\n[1:07:40] >> You got trolled.\n[1:07:42] >> So somebody posted on bun subreddit and\n[1:07:45] uh a very instigating post saying so bun\n[1:07:49] has been acquired by entropic and now it\n[1:07:51] turned into AI slop. and he took a\n[1:07:53] screenshot and on the screenshot he put\n[1:07:56] a red arrow pointing at like cloud and\n[1:07:59] pointing at like dot um you know agents\n[1:08:02] and pointing at skills of MD or agents\n[1:08:04] of MD. Yeah, it's AI slop and I was like\n[1:08:07] I was triggered like I was ready to go.\n[1:08:09] I was like [laughter]\n[1:08:11] and then under under the\n[1:08:13] >> AI defender.\n[1:08:15] No, no. It's because I've gotten this\n[1:08:17] feedback and I feel like you don't even\n[1:08:19] know how to use the tools properly and\n[1:08:21] you're just gonna\n[1:08:24] Oh my god, there's a dot cloud must be\n[1:08:25] AI slop, right? Um, so Oh my god,\n[1:08:28] >> I I agree with you. It that's\n[1:08:30] ridiculous. Someone jumping up and down\n[1:08:32] cloud,\n[1:08:32] >> right? And under the screenshot, he put\n[1:08:34] a note sarcasm, by the way. Um obviously\n[1:08:38] Bun has always had very good hygiene in\n[1:08:41] terms of agents directions and rules and\n[1:08:44] therefore um it's been it's been AI\n[1:08:47] managed for a long time and it's still\n[1:08:49] very good right I mean and then in the\n[1:08:51] comments unfortunately most people did\n[1:08:53] not read the last paragraph I can't\n[1:08:55] believe you\n[1:08:56] >> there were some people that were like\n[1:08:57] going like of course it's been acquired\n[1:08:59] by entropic of course it's going to go\n[1:09:00] down the hill blah blah blah yeah those\n[1:09:02] were\n[1:09:02] >> I can't believe AI is trained on Reddit\n[1:09:05] I mean Reddit is such a losers zone.\n[1:09:07] Sorry. A fun place. A fun place. Um,\n[1:09:11] okay.\n[1:09:11] >> So much so much worse than X, right? I\n[1:09:13] mean, X is obviously 10 times better,\n[1:09:15] right, Kai? X is is is the beacon of of\n[1:09:18] humanity in the Last Defense.\n[1:09:22] [snorts]\n[1:09:24] >> Again, with with images of of teenagers.\n[1:09:26] I forgot what was it.\n[1:09:27] >> Okay, you're right. We should all be on\n[1:09:28] Reddit. Okay, let's let's go back to\n[1:09:31] this this whole like\n[1:09:35] uh iteration cycle. So\n[1:09:39] what I wanted to ask you next, okay,\n[1:09:41] let's just say you know tests\n[1:09:43] >> cuz you you went on again about tests\n[1:09:45] and I said yes test\n[1:09:48] problem Kai stop worrying about them\n[1:09:49] >> infrastructure uh deploying the bad boy.\n[1:09:53] [snorts]\n[1:09:53] >> Well obviously you use terapform CDK for\n[1:09:55] that like obviously you want the strong\n[1:09:57] >> terform CDK. Yeah let's let's go\n[1:10:00] >> it's called CDK terrain now. So, I'm not\n[1:10:03] going to say what I'm not going to say\n[1:10:06] who came up with this, but like I saw\n[1:10:08] this uh video where basically they were\n[1:10:11] talking about the the life cycle of AI\n[1:10:14] products and basically to my shock and\n[1:10:18] horror in a way they were saying like\n[1:10:20] well we can we can regenerate the whole\n[1:10:22] application uh and uh\n[1:10:25] >> of the specs\n[1:10:26] >> from the spec and I was going like for\n[1:10:29] real? Uh not sure you could do that. Uh\n[1:10:31] but like I\n[1:10:33] >> mean if you have an unlimited token\n[1:10:34] budget.\n[1:10:35] >> Exactly. Exactly. But I mean yeah I mean\n[1:10:38] like I guess\n[1:10:42] we will we will be there actually\n[1:10:44] probably sooner than sooner than later\n[1:10:47] like we'll get to a point where like\n[1:10:48] when there's a test suite and a spec we\n[1:10:51] can regenerate it. But I wanted I wanted\n[1:10:53] to ask you Vincent Mr. spec it. Have you\n[1:10:58] ever like nuked the code and just start\n[1:11:00] it again? Uh I feel like this doesn't\n[1:11:03] really happen in practice.\n[1:11:06] >> Well, every time I use Gemini CLI, I had\n[1:11:08] to nuke the code and start again.\n[1:11:10] >> That's cuz it's generating [ __ ]\n[1:11:13] >> Well, you asked me did I ever nuke the\n[1:11:16] code and start again. Okay,\n[1:11:19] that actually is a good point because if\n[1:11:21] if the if Claude or like let's say if\n[1:11:24] there's a very good AI model generating\n[1:11:26] a really good code. Yeah. Why would you\n[1:11:29] nuke it and start again? I don't get it.\n[1:11:31] >> No, the main the main point that people\n[1:11:33] are making here is the power of\n[1:11:35] inversion um of\n[1:11:38] in legacy code bases requirement\n[1:11:41] documentation and diagrams were just the\n[1:11:43] props to support the code. the code was\n[1:11:46] the truth and the moment the code was\n[1:11:48] generated often diagrams lag behind.\n[1:11:51] >> When you inverse that power and you put\n[1:11:53] and you lead by spec you basically get a\n[1:11:56] much better documentation and a system\n[1:11:59] to to be able to\n[1:12:01] >> to understand why the code is the way it\n[1:12:03] is. you understand the intent of the\n[1:12:05] system and and that's maybe an\n[1:12:07] oversimplication simplification to say\n[1:12:10] we can just throw away all the code but\n[1:12:11] it is part of the idea that hey maybe\n[1:12:14] there's a new framework that allows us\n[1:12:16] to take those intentions those intents\n[1:12:19] that are captured inside the spec and\n[1:12:22] regen or recreate a system without\n[1:12:25] hitting a 100 edge cases that are not\n[1:12:27] documented right that the code is is\n[1:12:29] exposing as a feature or that feature\n[1:12:32] >> but you would agree with I mean, we're\n[1:12:34] not there yet. I mean, gez.\n[1:12:38] >> No, but um but this is one of the main\n[1:12:40] main main arguments. Uh but okay, what\n[1:12:44] you were saying just now when you said\n[1:12:46] we're going to be there eventually, I\n[1:12:48] actually wanted to say, did you see the\n[1:12:49] Bloomberg article or documentary about\n[1:12:52] the amount of money that's being\n[1:12:53] invested into AI and the AI bubble being\n[1:12:56] $450 billion\n[1:12:58] uh too big to fail? And that that's\n[1:13:01] recently a Bloomberg documentary that\n[1:13:03] came out that I think\n[1:13:03] >> I don't think I trust anything from\n[1:13:05] Bloomberg. But carry on. [laughter]\n[1:13:10] >> Well, yeah. I mean, like actually that\n[1:13:12] reminds me. I was at the pub um and\n[1:13:15] someone was telling me, \"Aren't you\n[1:13:16] concerned about AI? It's going to it\n[1:13:19] uses so much water and electricity.\" And\n[1:13:21] I'm like, \"Uh, for real? Um,\n[1:13:24] >> you're [snorts] living in the storms\n[1:13:26] created by AI.\n[1:13:29] >> [laughter]\n[1:13:30] >> No, I have the same because when I\n[1:13:32] introduce AI into the Terraform CDK\n[1:13:34] fork, I really am bracing myself. I'm\n[1:13:37] I'm afraid somebody will come along and\n[1:13:39] says like you're ruining the planet, but\n[1:13:42] like\n[1:13:44] I I mean I understand this this\n[1:13:47] >> I mean you and I are excited about AI\n[1:13:50] because we see it being a fantastic new\n[1:13:52] tool,\n[1:13:54] but I'm I I feel I feel definitely\n[1:13:57] detached about the cost.\n[1:14:01] I had an interesting discussion with a\n[1:14:02] friend after because he shared a ticket\n[1:14:04] with me because you you could buy a dual\n[1:14:06] ticket and and he's he's um after the\n[1:14:09] workshop he says oh you know this is\n[1:14:11] just a century old standard being\n[1:14:14] reintroduced under the hype of AI. Um,\n[1:14:17] so he was he he did enjoy the workshop,\n[1:14:19] but uh what he was more most interested\n[1:14:21] in is he had I have like he works for an\n[1:14:24] uh fintech startup and they have a GPU\n[1:14:26] fleet and he's like Vince what I really\n[1:14:28] want to know is how do I run these\n[1:14:29] things all on prem and I'm like I don't\n[1:14:31] want to waste my time on that. But but\n[1:14:33] we did end up talking about\n[1:14:35] >> maybe related to this with all of the\n[1:14:37] things that's happening across the world\n[1:14:39] and sovereignity and concerns and what\n[1:14:42] if these too big to fail companies of AI\n[1:14:44] go away. I said to him, well, you can be\n[1:14:46] the doom prepper. You can probably build\n[1:14:48] a bunker while you're at it, and you can\n[1:14:50] also build your uh inference cluster and\n[1:14:54] make sure that you're ready when all of\n[1:14:55] this collapses and you still have your\n[1:14:57] locally hosted.\n[1:14:58] >> Exactly. Exactly. I'm I'm definitely of\n[1:15:01] I mean, it's dangerous when people want\n[1:15:04] to prep and things like this. You\n[1:15:06] basically want the world to burn in a\n[1:15:08] way because now I have my my nuclear\n[1:15:10] bunker and my a my local Mac Mini\n[1:15:13] running my AI model. I'm ready for the\n[1:15:16] future. I mean, how can you think that\n[1:15:18] way? It's so stupid.\n[1:15:18] >> No, I want to have a friend like that.\n[1:15:20] [laughter]\n[1:15:20] I want I'm like, \"Yeah, you do. You go\n[1:15:22] do that.\"\n[1:15:24] >> Oh, we should we should be building\n[1:15:25] something together sustainably. It's\n[1:15:27] just crazy. Like, and like\n[1:15:31] you got to\n[1:15:31] >> And if someone tells me\n[1:15:32] >> for the best, plan for the worst. Okay.\n[1:15:35] >> I I don't believe it. Like if someone\n[1:15:36] tells me what the real cost of of Claude\n[1:15:39] is, I want to I want to tell them the\n[1:15:42] pricing plan. What What is the Claude\n[1:15:44] price? Are you on the max plan now?\n[1:15:48] >> Uh it's not yet end of January. I think\n[1:15:50] I will. Actually, I need to check when\n[1:15:52] is the billing date cuz I have canceled\n[1:15:55] a decent amount of subscriptions.\n[1:15:58] I can I think I can go on.\n[1:15:59] >> How do you see the damn pricing now?\n[1:16:01] Where's the bloody table? Yeah. Like\n[1:16:04] like to be honest I really I I really\n[1:16:07] hate how\n[1:16:09] >> the world works sometime sometimes\n[1:16:11] because if someone asks me what is the\n[1:16:13] cost\n[1:16:14] >> if someone asks me what is the cost of\n[1:16:16] AI I want to say $17 per month\n[1:16:21] >> that's what I want to say and people say\n[1:16:23] no Kai no you're you're wrong it's going\n[1:16:26] to dry up the rivers\n[1:16:28] >> it was just I guess\n[1:16:31] lites basically\n[1:16:34] I don't think they're completely wrong.\n[1:16:36] Some people are really affected, but\n[1:16:37] there's documentaries about small cities\n[1:16:40] in the US where they just went and build\n[1:16:42] a huge power uh plant and the whole\n[1:16:46] wildlife is impacted by the runoff water\n[1:16:50] and whatever and and the actual lake\n[1:16:53] getting warmer and killing um killing\n[1:16:56] the the fish.\n[1:16:58] >> And there are it's not come on Kai.\n[1:17:00] There are people that are living near\n[1:17:02] these power plants affected by it and\n[1:17:04] they're feeling the pain much more than\n[1:17:05] us. I I believe that. I believe that.\n[1:17:07] And\n[1:17:07] >> I don't want to believe it. It's just\n[1:17:09] doom doomer talk.\n[1:17:12] Duma talk. Oh, okay. Going back to the\n[1:17:15] agenda. So, would you\n[1:17:16] >> It's $150 Singapore dollars for me to\n[1:17:19] get the max plan. When is my billing\n[1:17:21] date? I should get it before my next\n[1:17:24] bill.\n[1:17:24] >> Get on it. Get on it.\n[1:17:27] >> Wow. You're really pushing me here. I'm\n[1:17:31] going to say it's your fault. When my\n[1:17:32] wife complains, I'm going to say Kai\n[1:17:34] told me to do it.\n[1:17:35] >> Well,\n[1:17:36] >> oh, renews on February 22. Oh, it just\n[1:17:38] renewed. Look at that. It renewed 3 days\n[1:17:40] ago.\n[1:17:40] >> We are AI. We are AI astronauts. It's\n[1:17:43] like it's like there's the ship ready to\n[1:17:45] go to the next planet and Vincent is\n[1:17:48] going, \"I'm not sure about it. I'm not\n[1:17:50] sure. I want to go next.\"\n[1:17:51] >> Are you on the next plan? Well, I I I\n[1:17:56] have a I have a special I have a special\n[1:17:58] key which I'm using, shall we say?\n[1:18:02] Okay. So, let's go back to this life\n[1:18:05] cycle thing. Uh would you add anything\n[1:18:08] to this? I mean would you see this one\n[1:18:10] to eight vibe code create a spec\n[1:18:12] technical design task list let the\n[1:18:15] agents implement it have some sort of\n[1:18:18] testing framework\n[1:18:20] and then\n[1:18:21] >> deployed me a website from\n[1:18:24] and I really I scrolled on the website\n[1:18:26] on my phone and it kind of broke so I\n[1:18:29] didn't want to I I did make a video but\n[1:18:30] I felt I felt bad I actually didn't\n[1:18:33] manage to send it but but I couldn't\n[1:18:35] understand the purpose of that website\n[1:18:36] but it sound like it's related to It's\n[1:18:38] like what is the AI um work\n[1:18:43] [clears throat]\n[1:18:44] uh adoption? Is that is that what that\n[1:18:46] website is about? Because I couldn't\n[1:18:47] really get it from website.\n[1:18:49] >> I don't know what website we're talking\n[1:18:50] about.\n[1:18:53] >> I will send you the link.\n[1:18:58] It's maybe I just mentioned the last bit\n[1:19:01] of the link.\n[1:19:03] Uh\n[1:19:06] but but actually more excited to talk\n[1:19:08] about the screenshot I shared below\n[1:19:09] because with which is about all the new\n[1:19:11] tools that have been added to cloud code\n[1:19:12] that I didn't even realize. Uh it's\n[1:19:14] called slai works\n[1:19:20] slash Oh no. Let's not talk about that.\n[1:19:22] Let's not talk about that. Please\n[1:19:25] [laughter]\n[1:19:26] let's not talk.\n[1:19:26] >> I was reading it. I couldn't understand.\n[1:19:28] Cut. Cut.\n[1:19:30] >> I didn't say anything. I just read out\n[1:19:32] the last bit of the URL.\n[1:19:34] >> Anyway, the I I hate I hate the animals\n[1:19:36] that paste in the screenshots of text,\n[1:19:38] but uh should we talk about this\n[1:19:40] quickly? I mean, to be honest,\n[1:19:42] >> no, like there's a couple of things in\n[1:19:44] there. Um and one more\n[1:19:46] >> some new tools.\n[1:19:48] >> Yeah. So, the the fact that now you can\n[1:19:50] tell cloud to store its plans directly\n[1:19:52] in your workspace so that other agents\n[1:19:54] can also see them is actually quite\n[1:19:56] nice.\n[1:19:57] >> So, I like that that you can those\n[1:19:59] plans. the I think claude does have\n[1:20:02] quite good documentation about all this\n[1:20:03] sort of stuff.\n[1:20:05] >> It does but like seeing a summary one\n[1:20:07] another one that that um the guy who\n[1:20:10] wrote speckit at Microsoft and promoted\n[1:20:13] it you know Dan he he's now in anthropic\n[1:20:16] he also shared about um he he has a new\n[1:20:18] YouTube video where it was like a very\n[1:20:20] underutilized function that most people\n[1:20:22] are not uh using properly within cloud.\n[1:20:25] What was it again?\n[1:20:27] >> Please share it. Please share it.\n[1:20:32] Let me find I'm definitely sub. There it\n[1:20:36] is. Hold on. I [snorts] I wanted to talk\n[1:20:39] about um web search actually.\n[1:20:44] Do you trust that Claude can do a web\n[1:20:46] search and find stuff off the internet?\n[1:20:48] This is something I'm always confused\n[1:20:49] about. Do I need to configure some other\n[1:20:53] tooling so that it can basically Google?\n[1:20:56] Because because essentially I I I the\n[1:20:58] only reason I use Gemini is is because\n[1:21:00] I'm assuming that it can search the web\n[1:21:02] better than Claude. You know what I\n[1:21:05] mean? Like how how do you make sure that\n[1:21:06] Claude has the latest information? Can\n[1:21:09] you rely on its web search tool or do\n[1:21:11] you use an\n[1:21:12] >> MC? You mean like when you're using it\n[1:21:14] and you're trying to make a plan and\n[1:21:15] you're asking it to go research from\n[1:21:17] libraries? I don't really trust it. I\n[1:21:19] always go back to chat GPT and and and I\n[1:21:22] can see it searched things and I can see\n[1:21:23] the links and then I put them back. This\n[1:21:25] is one thing that Clawude doesn't seem\n[1:21:27] to do all that well.\n[1:21:33] >> I'm trying to find it because it was\n[1:21:35] like something that I also never really\n[1:21:37] used much, but it's not on his um where\n[1:21:39] do I see my watch history like me?\n[1:21:43] >> It's It's hidden away in YouTube. It's\n[1:21:46] like\n[1:21:46] >> it's ridiculous.\n[1:21:47] >> On the left or something. It's\n[1:21:48] ridiculous.\n[1:21:50] And another thing is like if if Theo is\n[1:21:52] watching, I I actually wanted to\n[1:21:55] >> I wanted to like bookmark his video\n[1:21:58] about like good bits and I wanted to\n[1:22:00] somehow refer I guess I could just\n[1:22:03] record the time code, but like I wish\n[1:22:05] there was a way in YouTube to bookmark\n[1:22:07] things\n[1:22:09] easier.\n[1:22:10] >> He has a different channel. I subscribe\n[1:22:11] to it now. So it's called the cloud code\n[1:22:13] feature senior engineers keep missing\n[1:22:16] and it was\n[1:22:19] custom/comand hooks kill hooks. Oh\n[1:22:25] he was uh\n[1:22:27] >> okay let let's probably\n[1:22:29] >> I remember\n[1:22:29] >> let's probably wrap up\n[1:22:31] >> it's it's a hook that that um that\n[1:22:33] allows the agent to validate its work\n[1:22:36] when it's doing something. So when you\n[1:22:38] execute a custom command hook, it will\n[1:22:41] then also run a um when you run a custom\n[1:22:45] command, it will invoke a hook. So after\n[1:22:48] you\n[1:22:48] >> Yeah. Yeah. I I use hooks. I use hooks.\n[1:22:51] I The cool thing is that you could just\n[1:22:52] tell Claw to set up your hooks instead\n[1:22:55] of messing around with pre-commit crap.\n[1:22:58] [snorts]\n[1:22:59] >> Yeah. Anyway, I I got to get ready to uh\n[1:23:02] take my kids to the swimming pool.\n[1:23:06] So what did you\n[1:23:09] what what what does the future hold? Did\n[1:23:10] you manage to have your interview and\n[1:23:12] stuff like this and did you\n[1:23:14] >> I have to go in to an office but I asked\n[1:23:17] them to do it the week after. What what\n[1:23:19] my in like immediate future is the\n[1:23:21] release the pre-release of the Terraform\n[1:23:23] CDK fork.\n[1:23:24] >> Okay.\n[1:23:25] >> Um and we've managed to make all of the\n[1:23:28] test pass and\n[1:23:32] documentation website. I'm trying to\n[1:23:33] port that over and then for later I I I\n[1:23:37] look like I I have some project that is\n[1:23:40] coming that I'm excited about.\n[1:23:42] >> Cool. So you're you're a busy guy, I\n[1:23:44] assume.\n[1:23:45] >> Yeah, I'm I'm I'm hoping to Yeah. Well,\n[1:23:48] I'm going to go to Fosdom and uh config\n[1:23:51] management camp next week and I'm hoping\n[1:23:53] just to chat to people like I am with\n[1:23:55] you and just be excited about the\n[1:23:58] future. I suppose that's the best I\n[1:23:59] could hope for.\n[1:24:01] Oh, there's one thing I really like in\n[1:24:02] cloud code that's on the screenshots,\n[1:24:04] which is when you have yes, um, yes, no,\n[1:24:07] you can tab and on the on the no, you\n[1:24:10] there's a highlight that you can say\n[1:24:12] tab. So, you you press tab and then you\n[1:24:14] know, and you can add some some details\n[1:24:16] about why you don't accept it.\n[1:24:17] >> Yeah, I know about that.\n[1:24:18] >> And you can do that on Yes, too.\n[1:24:21] >> Yeah,\n[1:24:21] >> you can accept and give it some give it\n[1:24:23] some extra context. Yeah, man. It's so\n[1:24:26] exciting with Claude. It's so exciting.\n[1:24:29] I can't I couldn't even get I tried open\n[1:24:32] code. It I couldn't get it to even run\n[1:24:34] on March. It just goes it's just a blank\n[1:24:36] screen.\n[1:24:37] Anyway, thanks.\n[1:24:39] >> What is a blank screen in in inside VS\n[1:24:41] Code or or\n[1:24:43] >> when I run open code on Amachi, it just\n[1:24:45] it just it just opens up a it just does\n[1:24:48] nothing. I I\n[1:24:50] >> told you Omari completely broke on my\n[1:24:54] update. It was was a very painful\n[1:24:57] update.\n[1:24:57] >> Yeah, I think I know why. because it\n[1:24:59] doesn't seem to snapshot the the the the\n[1:25:01] boundary on the home directory is not\n[1:25:03] very clear. So you could I think what\n[1:25:05] you did right is that you made some\n[1:25:07] weird home configuration and that broke\n[1:25:09] your system.\n[1:25:11] >> No. Yeah. I mean in a way ultimately\n[1:25:14] it's something like that. It's because I\n[1:25:15] use um YQ version 4 and the Omari\n[1:25:20] templates you um have some expressions\n[1:25:23] that only work with version three. So my\n[1:25:25] global path was pointing to version four\n[1:25:28] and that broke\n[1:25:30] >> and but it was painful because like yes\n[1:25:33] you have your\n[1:25:33] >> you couldn't I mean if if you just\n[1:25:36] updated the package couldn't you roll\n[1:25:38] back using the snapshots?\n[1:25:40] >> I I was reading what I could do and and\n[1:25:42] one of the issues was talking about\n[1:25:44] these these hyperl configs not being\n[1:25:47] part of the snapshots. So I didn't even\n[1:25:48] try because I knew that if I would roll\n[1:25:50] back I would still have the problem\n[1:25:52] because all of my hyperl configs were\n[1:25:53] messed up because they were all have\n[1:25:55] they they added templating for the\n[1:25:56] colors for the theme colors into the\n[1:25:59] hyperl configs and that templating\n[1:26:01] depends on version four uh three of of\n[1:26:04] YQ the YAML uh like JQ built for YQ. So\n[1:26:07] because of that all of my templates were\n[1:26:09] messed up. None of the hyperl stuff was\n[1:26:11] working because it was breaking halfway\n[1:26:13] down. none of the screens like the the\n[1:26:16] menu bar everything was gone and and it\n[1:26:18] was very painful but the fix was\n[1:26:19] ultimately simple like just make sure\n[1:26:21] that yq3 is globally set and you only\n[1:26:25] use other versions of yq\n[1:26:26] >> so how did you fix it so you didn't roll\n[1:26:28] back to a snapshot there\n[1:26:30] >> I tried many things uh running some of\n[1:26:32] the commands that DHH was providing and\n[1:26:34] some of the the issue threads which was\n[1:26:36] like running Pac-Man re rer running set\n[1:26:39] using the default team is one of the the\n[1:26:40] the main troubleshoot ways is to make\n[1:26:44] sure you're on the default team and and\n[1:26:45] running that command again because it re\n[1:26:46] resets most of the\n[1:26:48] >> running on the the default\n[1:26:50] >> there is a there is a like set team\n[1:26:52] >> default theme oh yeah\n[1:26:54] >> yeah theme like the Tokyo night one is\n[1:26:56] default and that if you're on another\n[1:26:57] theme you should try running back to the\n[1:26:59] default theme and then go back to your\n[1:27:01] team or whatever um\n[1:27:03] >> very painful but so happy when it was\n[1:27:05] fixed I did spend like I think half a\n[1:27:07] day or maybe\n[1:27:09] >> welcome to to ax lifestyle\n[1:27:14] But that I mean that's\n[1:27:14] >> I want out Kai. I'm tired now.\n[1:27:18] >> You won out. But it doesn't surprise me.\n[1:27:20] Hyperland with all its freaking configs\n[1:27:22] and theing these things break things.\n[1:27:26] >> I still have so many Nvidia driver\n[1:27:28] issues with Chromium and other\n[1:27:30] flickering issues\n[1:27:31] >> and the lock screen. I mean Hyperland\n[1:27:34] with with Nvidia drivers is apparently a\n[1:27:36] super painful combo. Do you have\n[1:27:38] >> do you have a one of those dedicated GPU\n[1:27:41] things or do you have\n[1:27:42] >> Yeah. So when I bought my motherboard uh\n[1:27:45] sorry my do you have a video card an\n[1:27:47] Nvidia video card or something? No.\n[1:27:49] >> When I bought my Intel CPU it I bought\n[1:27:52] the one that doesn't come with the\n[1:27:54] integrated graphic processor which I\n[1:27:56] didn't know but like I I have my\n[1:27:57] dedicated discrete GPU anyway. So it was\n[1:28:00] like no problem, right? Until you run\n[1:28:02] Arch because then when you have some\n[1:28:04] Nvidia driver issues, you get a lot more\n[1:28:06] pain because of your your driver.\n[1:28:08] >> Sell your Nvidia card at a profit and\n[1:28:10] buy one of those Intel arcs.\n[1:28:14] Job done.\n[1:28:15] >> Why would I What What is ARC? Is that\n[1:28:18] like a discrete GPU of Intel?\n[1:28:20] >> Yeah, I think it's\n[1:28:21] >> Why would I go there?\n[1:28:22] >> Because their GPUs probably have good\n[1:28:24] support under Linux, probably.\n[1:28:27] But how am I going to prepare for the AI\n[1:28:30] apocalypse [laughter]\n[1:28:32] if I don't have an Nvidia GPU? I have\n[1:28:35] some life-saving GPU and you're telling\n[1:28:36] me to sell it? Guy, you are the worst\n[1:28:39] doom prepper. [laughter]\n[1:28:41] Go take your kids to swim.\n[1:28:45] >> Okay, guys. If you got this far, please\n[1:28:47] like this podcast and leave a review.\n[1:28:51] And\n[1:28:53] I don't know what else you should do. V.\n[1:28:56] Don't doom prep like an idiot.\n[1:28:59] [laughter]\n[1:29:00] >> Worst advice ever.\n[1:29:02] >> Bye.",

Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 94,054 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line.

Can you hear me? Oh, the video is\nalready on.\n>> Oh my god. What is that? I didn't even\nsee that.\n>> It's daylight. It's day. But\n>> sorry, but can't tell when you're an AI\nengineer what day of time what day of\ntime it is. All I know is when my\ncredits renew.\n>> Ah, yeah. Uh, are you are you upgrading\nthe plans yet?\n>> What do you mean upgrading the plans?\n>> I I read several people that are like I\nused to I used to switch between Gemini\nCloud Code and other and Codeex and now\nI'm all in on on cloud code and I'm kind\nof in the same boat. [snorts]\n>> Yeah, I'm all in. I'm all in. I mean,\nthat also gets to a point of the I would\nlike to talk about with the with the\nlatest Theo's video. Theo's video.\n>> I haven't seen that one. This is the\nTheo's video reaction podcast for all\nthose who are listening.\nH Oh, I just I just want\n>> How did you get to cloudbot even?\n>> Um yeah, I did. I didn't even I set it\nup. I was maybe going to show you that\nif you haven't seen it already.\nI wanted to um ask you.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, I just wanted to check in with\nyou. How's your week been? cuz it's been\nlike 2 weeks since we spoke last.\nAnd I wanted to add there was another\nstorm in England called Storm Ingrid.\nAnd that means that the train line\nbetween my station and London has been\ncut off until they fix it, which is\nfreaking me out.\nSounds painful.\nYeah,\nmy week. Um, it's actually very exciting\nbecause we've got a full green test\nsuite on the rename of the Terafhone\nCDK. So, we're going to cut a\npre-release giving anyone the ability to\npull it from the package registries, you\nknow. Um, so I'm setting up the the\nMaven and Nugat doing settings now. So,\nthat\n>> what do you need? Maven is a Java build\nsystem. You need that for CDK.\n>> Yeah. Uh CDK for Terraform is published\nand available in all the gsi languages.\nAnd it was actually easier to just\nrename and get the thing like all of the\nintegration tests are passing Java,Net,\nGolang, Python.\n>> Oh, so you support you support like\nevery language under the sun.\n>> No, the the gsi question uh languages,\nright? the the ones that are supported\nby the CDK cloud development kit.\nAlthough they if if you look at the\necosystem, most people only or most\nprojects only support uh TypeScript and\num Python Python these days. Yeah, some\ndon't even support Golang. I don't\nunderstand. I really like Golang, but\nit's it is a bit slow. When I run the\ntests, they are very fast on uh on on\nseveral uh languages, but they're a bit\nslower\non on Golang. I don't if you I don't\nknow if you remember TJ Hollywood\nChuck's uh apex app but he he wrote his\ntool\nin Go and I think it inter interacted\ndirectly with Terraform which makes me\nthink that Terraform has some cool go.\nOh, very much like the whole of\nTerraform is written in in in go\nalthough that that um Hashi Cororp has\nmoved more of the interfaces behind an\ninternal uh package so that you cannot\naccess it externally like before 1.4\nfour. I think you could basically use\nany library that Terraform was using\nunder the hood directly because they\nweren't using the internal one, but then\nthey moved it for I it makes sense in\nterms of encapsulation and so that you\ncan uh\n>> Yeah. So, it makes me think that if\nyou're if you're working in Go\nand you have your little Go program,\n>> Yeah. But doesn't work,\n>> you might as well just integrate\ndirectly with Terraform or something\nlike that is what I'm thinking aloud.\n>> Oh, I see. Um,\nyes and no.\n>> Yeah. And for complicated things maybe\nwith\n>> No, but the thing is right um the way\nthat the CDK works is it um\nit basically has [snorts] the core\nwritten in in JavaScript, right? NodeJS.\nAnd when you run it in Java or Golang,\nand that's probably also why it's slow.\nIt's actually running a Node uh\nsubprocess. And and I think one of the\nthings that that people are trying to do\nis to get that kernel that uh gsi kernel\nsystem in in boon. It would be a lot\nfaster than having a whole GS process.\nYeah.\n>> You call it sorry\n>> you call it boon.\n>> Boon. Boon is Vietnamese way of saying\n>> rice noodles.\n>> Bun.\n>> Yeah.\nYeah. So I can show you clawbot because\nI just have a tab open. I noticed.\n>> Yeah, sure. It just sounds I don't know\nwhen I read about it, it sounds like\nsomething.\n>> Well, the hype is the the hype is crazy\nright now. So,\n>> yeah.\n>> So, essentially, I got you remember I um\nI showed you that\n>> had my Yeah, multiple IPs. I basically\ngot this running in a in a\nsystemd end spawn. So, I didn't run out\nand buy a Mac Mini. I just set it up\num\non my Raspberry Pi and it was plenty\nfine enough. So, I feel like this\nClaudebot should be getting a kickback\nfrom all the Apple sales because the\nbronze is just fine on a pie. And of\ncourse, I configured it with uh with\nwith anthropic stuff. I'm hoping I don't\nuh show anything\n>> for cloudy or something crazy. Yeah, but\nfor cloud bot it's not it's just still\nrunning in inference remotely, right?\nThere's no local no local LLM at all,\nright?\n>> Well, I think that that that's where\npeople are buying the Mac Mini is\nbecause I think there's a promise\n>> that they can run the local LLM, but I I\nmean I don't\n>> I don't really see the point.\n>> Not too sure why.\nYeah, because [snorts] there's a\nresurgence in people talking about\ngetting an MAC Mini for uh I think it's\nfor GLM, right? Because there's this\nproject that came out that um binds\ncloud code shell using a proxy with the\nsame bindings that that Antropic uses\nand cannot avoid. People say this is\nquite a solid way of um using GLM. Uh\n>> what's what's GLM? Sorry.\nJM I think it's is one of the Chinese uh\nbut it's on hugging face it's like an\nopen source\n>> so everyone's sharing about how great it\nis it's from z.ai AI\n>> that's Chinese, right?\n>> No. Well, the cool thing about the the\nthing that there's two things that have\nsold Claudebot to me is that I can\ninteract with it on WhatsApp. I even\nhave a group between my wife and I and\nnow we can just directly talk so uh talk\nto to Claude through WhatsApp. We could\nleave messages. You we could send\npictures. So instead of like launching a\ndedicated\napp, it's just the familiar WhatsApp\ninterface. So that's that's that's the\nkiller\nuh use case for using Claude for hosting\nClaudebot. And then you you link it you\nlink it up to WhatsApp just like any\nother client and you can just talk to\nit.\nUm so that so that's great. And and I\nguess the other cool thing about\nuh Claudebot\nis\nsee it's running on one of my IPs. Um I\nguess the chron jobs I mean I I don't\nknow how you would do this with claude\nor or codeex or whatever. Like for\nexample,\nlike you you can set up a a chron job\nrunning every so many hours\n[snorts]\n>> and then you and then you just prompt\nit. You say like check this URL for\nweather warnings and give updates\nand then also I have another one called\nannounce tomorrow's main event games.\n>> You have a lot of storms so you need\nweather updates to the minute now.\n>> [snorts]\n>> Yeah,\nwe have a lot of storms, but to be\nhonest, I'm not too sure if this is\nactually working.\nWe still have we still have another\nweather warning,\nrun,\nand maybe I give you a demo on the um on\nthe phone.\nI have to switch my\n>> You actually have an external camera.\nThat's pretty cool.\n>> I use I use my my phone as the external\ncamera. Oh,\n>> maybe I should do that on my on my Omari\nsetup cuz I have like this USB camera.\nIt's really bad.\n>> Okay, so let me show you what the\nexperience is.\n>> Oh, there's one big news also. System\ninitiative.\nOkay.\n>> Oh, yeah.\nI saw it on LinkedIn myself.\n>> Uh, say hello to Vincent\nin Vietnam.\nWhat's the weather there?\nWhat's the [snorts]\nweather there?\nSo, you basic So, I have it sort of\nchatting to myself. You see Kai Hendry?\nIt's like configured to chat to me in my\nown. Why you don't use Telegram? I think\nTelegram said a bot would be easier than\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is painful.\n>> Yeah. And I have it hooked up to\nanthropic. So basically this should be\nan anthropic answer. And I've also\nhooked up the Brave API. So it should be\nable to do web searches better.\nUm\nand what did it say there?\n>> Yeah, nice. It's like 48°. Uh not 48.\nWhat does it say? It's it's actually\nquite chilly these days. I don't\n>> I don't understand how to get rid of the\nbloody keyboard.\n>> This is a And then of course it knows\nwhere I am. So So say hey Vincent\nsomething in Vietnamese.\n>> What? 16° in Hanoi. You see the problem\nwith 16° consider 88 humidity. That\nmakes it like double double cold. If you\nhave like I used to live in Belgium\nwhere it was like minus like subzero and\nit felt warmer than Hanoi because Hanoi\n16 degrees with that humidity is just\nannoying. You know all your clothes\nclamp to you. [snorts]\n>> Oh yeah. Cling in.\n>> Yeah. Cling. And and then the the the\nhouses, they have like these paper thin\nwalls and and and um and windows and\nthere's no central heating like like if\nyou're in in Europe, you you go home,\nyou take off your coat and you're in\ncozy inside your house. And when you\ncome out, you still have all of that\nwarmth inside your body and you don't\nfeel the cold for a while. But in in\nHanoi, you're you're wearing a jacket\ninside the house. you're in this\nhumidity and when you go outside, you're\nalready freezing before you go outside.\nSo, you're just constantly cold. That's\nhow I feel about living in Hano.\n>> But but wait a minute, you're in Ho Chi\nMin, I thought.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But it's it's going to be\nLunar New Year, and my my uh\nfamily-in-law is from from the north, so\nI'm going to have to go. I've I've\navoided it. But Lunar New Year is always\nin this uh January time, and then it's\nalways cold.\n>> Oh, no. So, your your wife is from the\nnorth, is she? Huh? Yes, yes, yes.\n>> Oh, well, so that Yeah, that's\nClaudebot. Yeah, I saw the system\ninitiative news because I I should\nactually be\n>> What news did you see though? Because\nit's actually much more spicy than what\nit looks like.\n>> Okay, so first order is that there's\nFosdom next week. I'm going there. Um\n>> and and Adam is going to be there. Adam,\n>> there's there's this thing called config\nmanagement camp. I think I told you\nabout this.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you said that you\nwere really excited to get the demo of\nsystem initiative from them and I was\nstill sure you're going to get it.\n[laughter]\n>> Well, no. I mean, I've I've had the I've\nhad the spiel a year or two ago,\n>> but this I this conflict management\ncamp, if you're an infrastructure\nengineer, I think this is probably the\nbest\nuh\nthe the best infrastructure sort of\ncentric\nconference I've ever been to. But yeah,\nlast year I bumped into Adam there and I\nhad I had a good old chat.\n>> Adam Jacob is giving a talk.\n>> Yeah. So,\nwho\n>> the CEO and co-founder\nand now the only employee.\n>> Yeah.\nSo the news that I saw on LinkedIn was\num a person called John posting that\nsystem initiative is ending and I'm\nlooking for a new position.\n>> I saw that\n>> and then the repost from Adam Jacobs\nbeing and the funny thing is about\nLinkedIn if you put paragraphs it only\nshows the first paragraph. So so Adam\nJacob reacted with like John is a really\ngreat person to work with. anyone who\nhas the opportunity to hire him is lucky\nblah blah blah and then there was like\nthis little more dot dot dot right and I\nhadn't opened it and it was like oh wow\nSI is shutting down unfortunately or\nfortunately you have to click the more\nand below the fault he says and SI is\nnot shutting down it's just drastically\nreduced\n>> and that was very funny to to post it as\na second paragraph because it really\nmade it not look like if you didn't look\ncarefully it really looked like SI is\nshut down But\n>> yeah, I mean I mean I mean that's the\nwhat do you call it? every startup\nsort of\n>> well it's not a startup right how much\nVC only did they take and how long have\nthey been like working on this like four\nor five years already you know I've\nheard about them back in\n>> I think the first years the first demo I\nsaw was two years ago maybe max\n>> okay Google the total VC money raised\nand when it was first announced I'm\nbetting it's around 2019 or 2020 that it\nwas Well, I don't know how much VC you\ngot. I mean, it this is just the story\nof every uh startup that doesn't quite\nsucceed.\n>> Well, I just don't think it's very fair\nbecause fair or what?\n>> Because they just raise money like it's\nwater because of their legacy.\n>> That's normal. That's normal, man.\nThat's normal. We're as Europeans, we're\njust not used to like\n>> Yeah,\n>> that's the whole thing about\n>> about this whole um what's happening\nbetween Europe and America now and\neveryone saying every [snorts] startup\nthat in in Europe, you know, tends to be\nsuccessful just leaves Europe and raises\nmoney in the US and\n>> um you know, being out in the US.\n>> Come on. You need a you need a bunch of\ncash to hire like a couple of good\nengineers for Christ's sake. So,\n>> I think you should have a working demo.\n>> I I guess he did have a working demo.\n>> He did have a working demo. He did have\na working demo. And I guess if you told\nme that they had customers and they shut\ndown, then I'd be going, \"Oh.\"\n>> Yeah. So, so my opinion about SI is I I\nwas informed about it like back in 2020\nas some exciting new startup. I looked\nat it maybe at the glance. Then at the\nstart of the year 2025, I was looking\nfor something to um invest my time in\nlike an because I worked on my own\nproject and that's kind of fun but it\ndoesn't really help with like it doesn't\nhave a lot of visibility right it\ndoesn't really prove much because\nthere's no adoption. So I was looking\nWell, it depends, right? If you can get\nyour\n>> So So you you've been sort of comparing\nyour your projects to\n>> No, no, no. I I was more like I'm I was\nlooking at what is then if if this isn't\nit what I'm working on, what is the next\nthing and then I si came on my on my\nradar again. So I went to the discord\nasking like in January exactly a year\nago asking um like how to contribute and\nlike and not asking just saying as an\nintroduction that I will I will you know\nspend some time into looking for a\nproject and and one of the SI people\nsent me a list of you of code to look at\nlike here's the core way that we\ninteract with the cloud API this is how\nwe we do this and how we do that and my\nfirst impression\nI just exited the discord at that point.\nI was like that's not how I see the\nfuture of IC at all. Um I understand the\nunderlying principle of of a\nprogrammable\ngraph of nodes\nand that's also what you you get with\nlike terapform provider AWS. It has a\ngraph\n>> and and system\ninitiatives uh visualization I thought\nwas the uh\nwas the wheel.\n>> Yeah. But [snorts]\n>> I've always [sighs and gasps] I've\nalways been a huge fan of of code first\napproaches. Even when I look at like the\nuh entity framework like on net back\nwith Microsoft, they had three ways of\nusing the .NET entity framework. You\ncould do quote first diagram first or\ndatabase first. Schema first. And I\nalways really preferred either schema\nfirst or database um first. So you have\nan existing table and you extract it.\nAnd and this this idea of drawing a\ndiagram and then having the code\ngenerated from it never really appealed\nme cuz you don't have the flexibility or\npower to define what you mean with just\na diagram. Like a diagram is like\ntwo-dimensional representation. I just\ndon't think it's a it's a very good way\nof of capturing information. I think you\ncan generate a diagram from code. That\nmakes sense to me. Um,\n>> you can annotate code with with with\ndecorators that indicate or or and some\ntype of indicating this is how you\nvisualize this stuff on on a diagram.\nThat makes sense to me.\n>> Yeah.\n>> The the sort of revel [clears throat]\nso I I I might have mentioned this CDK\nupgrade last chat that we had. Right.\nSo, and it was kind of ruining my life\nbecause I I told you there was like two\nyears of breaking changes or something\nlike that.\n>> Yeah. classic IC problem because IC is\ntreated as as is is called code but it's\nnot really treated as code. So so people\ndon't put in proper CI/CD and stuff.\n>> I'm not too sure I got into the details\nabout the the Kinesis uh library going\nstable and blah blah blah blah.\n>> Yeah, I think you mentioned it.\n>> The the thing was is that\nthe code base is huge. It is huge. It's\nit's a very big organization, very big\nlandscape and running CDK synth is slow\nas hell, right? Um, so\nuh I I spent some time just getting uvx\nty check to to to sort of run and to\nmake sure\n>> So you're running s on a python.\n>> Yeah, it's slow as hell.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a problem\nwith gsi and this is a common complaint\nI heard about it.\n>> Yeah,\n>> it's slow in Golang too. It's [snorts]\nsuper slow compared to JavaScript.\n>> What I what I wanted to say um when it\ncomes to infrastructure\nenhancements\nis that CDK has has the has the promise\nof doing a quick type check to make sure\nthat everything's kind of okay, right?\nJust like go has strong typing. you yeah\nyou can you can shoehorn typing into CDK\nand I think the GS\n>> No no no no no no hold on hold on the\nproblem here is the language right\nyou're talking about typing on Python\nand being it being slow\n>> well it's it's not it's not actually\nthat slow when I was running t uh ty\ncheck the the new tool from um Astral\nit's better than I don't know what the\nother one was called the Python one was\n>> rough check rough\n>> no it wasn't rough it was called uh oh\nman I forgot Not. So, long story short\nis that I managed to uh sanity check\nsome of my my code base in light of the\nuh the the module name changes just by\ndoing type checking this UBX type. So,\nbasically it it yeah it helped me get\nfaster feedback. I didn't need to have\nmy AWS set up.\n>> I didn't I didn't need to run CDK synth.\nIt does sound it does sound like the\nidea of of because Typescript is the\ncore of of gsi, right? You can't have\ngsi without typescript. TypeScript is\nhow it creates all the bindings to other\nlanguages\n>> and and it's very it's very much focused\non fast type checking and and this is my\nbiggest complaint about all the other\nterap like infrastructure as code\nsolutions aside from polomy is that they\ndon't really have proper type checking\nor even a type right\n>> I didn't know about that\n>> terform\n>> well I thought no I said aside from\npulley\n>> oh aside from okay sorry\n>> py and you can probably talk about form\nand pickle, but those guys are absolute\nhacks, so I'm not going to talk about\nthat.\n>> Okay, so [laughter]\n[snorts] okay, hold on. Let me just have\na sip of coffee and try to make my point\nonce more\nthat it was extremely slow in Python and\nthat you had a lot of issues. Uh, but to\nme the problem is Python and that's\nprobably\n>> Well, I mean maybe you're right, but I\nwant I mean I've worked with with CDK on\nand off for some years,\nbut it only just occurred to me\nthat type checking\nuh is absolutely critically important\nfor infrastructure just because it gives\nyou that a really powerful shift left uh\nerror check that everything's kind of\ngoing to be okay. You know what I mean?\nBecause like these what I'm trying to\nsay is that a lot of projects that I I I\nwork with with the clients, the type\ncheck just doesn't work right. It just\ndoesn't work. It's broken. And and then\nand then and then of course things break\ndown uh down the road and uh and then\nyou're wondering why that things broke.\nIt's like, well, maybe you should have\ndone some type checking uh earlier sort\nof thing. So, that that that's that's\nthe point I'm trying to make. And and I\nguess since you work with TypeScript,\nyou get you get the type check uh\nfeedback immediately, right?\n>> The the whole experience is pretty\nsweet. No, but like the whole reason why\nI use CDK is exactly for the ability to\ndefine strong schemas and types around\nconstructs around composable\ninfrastructure. Right? Terraform has a\nconcept of a module to compose your\ninfrastructure. Terraform is by far the\nlargest um or the most adopted today,\nright? Um and everybody loves the very\nsimple Hashik config language. But in\nterms of type system it doesn't really\ndo or provide much. In terapform modules\nyou can define a variable. Those are\nbasically your properties or your\ninputs. Those variables can have complex\ntypes but there's no concept of having a\ntype definitions that you can apply to\nmultiple variables for example.\n>> So if you have something complicated in\nyour modules and and you can then start\narguing yeah but you're doing you're\nusing the cloud wrong. If you're doing\ncomplicated modules\nstart I'm telling you\n>> yeah yeah I mean\n>> inevitable\n>> yeah so so long\n>> and exactly what your experiences right\nI mean infrastructure typing is\ncompletely lacking very important but\nrequires a huge amount of upfront work\nwhich is not realistic for most\norganizations\n>> right you can't expect a platform team\nto fully define and keep up to date um a\ncloud interface that you're exposed to\nThat's impossible. Like you have a job\nto do, you know. You don't have a job\njust\n>> I hope I hope you I'm sure you would\nagree with me that like if there's any\ninfrastructure\nuh\ntrend or the biggest thing in\ninfrastructure in the last two years is\nbasically type checking\nis probably\n>> well this is\n>> it's probably what what I want to allude\nto. Okay, that's an interesting\nidea because I have a lot of discussions\nwith Terra team and Terra team they are\na small um Terraform automation and\ncollaboration solution or so they are um\nthere's two people Malcolm and Josh I\nknow [clears throat] I forgot his name\nand they are fans of Oak camel right\nvery strong type systems\n>> um they built this this this um\nterraform state be imagined using state\ngraph and I think ideas like state graph\nthey basically reimplement the whole\nterapform state idea and the way that\nyou run terapform apply by breaking down\nwhatever is in your state to individual\nresources so that you can have a massive\nmonolithic state but you can lock um\nindividual components of your state so\nyou don't get the big like right now\nterraform locks the whole state file and\nyou cannot have two people locking the\nsame state file or you get conflicts\nright so the solution is people break\nstates down. So they address this\nproblem by changing the API around the\nterraform state in state graph. That's\ntheir main um contribution in state\ngraph is to basically\nprovide a new runtime across the\nterraform state reuse all the terapform\nproviders and and and and it's a very it\nit's kind of like I mean to be honest\n>> so so so to make to break down the the\nstate and make it uh composable or\nsomething like that or\n>> Yes. So, so basically they use um\ndatabase row level locking around\nresources rather than locking the whole\nstate file.\n>> So, because Terapform treats the state\nas a single file and you'll either lock\nthe whole file or you um or you Yeah,\nyou need to lock on the whole file and\nall\n>> but a lot of like Terraform shops would\nwould obviously break down the state\n>> by you know\nissues.\n>> Yes. And then you get you get problems\nwith crossstate lock um dependencies and\ncoordination. You need to orchestrate\njobs to run and lock individual\ncomponents or apply them and you have a\nlot more problems that you already have\nsolved by the state graph or by the\nterraform graph.\n>> Right.\n>> Right. So Terraform when it runs it\ncreates a graph of all of your resources\nwithin the state but it locks the whole\nstate file.\n>> Yeah. I mean CDK has this problem too.\nSo just take\n>> because CDK CDK is just using uh\nterraform but but the the thing is I\nhave a lot of discussion with Malcolm\nand Josh around the type system in\ninfrastructure as code and they really\nlike when I talked to them I said type\nsystem is the most important uh that's\nwhy I work on CDK because it provides me\na typescript system without forcing\nanyone to use another tool right unlike\npuli where you have to then you know\nadopt a different runtime you have\npolitics about what people's or platform\nteams want to support. You don't have to\ndo these arguments. You can just tell\nanyone like look we're still delivering\nyou as a team. We're delivering you\nterapform configuration and that fits\nnicely in your in your pipeline. Let's\nnot argue about how we generate this\nterapform config, right? Um and and so\nbasically what I like about the CDK is\nthat it gives you that capability but it\nadds a very strong type system on top.\nSo as a product team or as a platform\nteam I get much more powerful tools like\nwhat you just said. I can shift more of\nmy validation early and they agree with\nme like a type system is very important\nas\n>> I mean that that said there's many a\nproject a Python project which doesn't\ndo the type checking but carry on\n>> and so they agree with me regarding the\num the fact that type system are very\nimportant uh because they prefer throny\ntype uh languages as well and that's\nkind of a shift in the industry as well\nright before people really like um you\nknow runtime uh type systems and so on,\nbut now it's more compile time systems.\nUm, people have learned that that's\nreally efficient and they don't agree\nwith me that this is possible with\ninfrastructure because the APIs around\nthe infrastructure do not provide you\nstrong schemas or strong type checking\nmechanisms. So if you look at the\nTerraform provider for AWS, it doesn't\nlike for some resources or even the AWS\nservice API doesn't really give you a\nstrong schema. It just says we accept a\nJSON document and that JSON document um\nfollows a certain schema, but um that's\nnot part of the JSON uh sorry that's not\npart of the Terraform configuration\nfile. There's no validation against the\nschema until you run Terapform apply.\nSo, so we're kind of monkey patching a\nschema on top of it using CDK, right?\nWhere the problem exists actually at the\nlower level because the Terraform\nprovider itself who's been built against\nthe cloud API does not expose the\ninternal type system of the API we're\ntalking to. It gives you a maybe one\nlayer.\n>> There's quite a few layers, isn't there?\nThere's quite a few layers and things.\nSo, so that's where where where a lot of\npeople I talk to when we talk about like\nwe've try we really like Terraform but\nwe weren't able to find adoption because\nwe don't have a large library of\nstrongly typed classes and interfaces\nfor multiple clouds right and several\norganizations have built their own\nlibraries like now that I'm part of the\nmaintainers of the terraform CDK\ncommunity fork I've talked to several\norganizations that we have built two\nyears of AWS as type system like classes\naround AWS services and we we really\ndepend on this uh for all of our product\nteams. So they are our platform team.\nThey build these these strongly typed um\nobjects but it's all private, right? And\nI'm like, why is everyone building these\nindividual private libraries? Um, unlike\nthe AWS CDK, which is a public massive\nlibrary that everybody can use. And as\nlong as everybody uses a shared library,\n>> um, that then it's worth it, but it must\nexist. And that's the biggest problem\nwith Terraform CDK. Nobody ever built\nsuch library. So using Terraform CDK\ndidn't give you much benefit unless you\nhad the ability to have such access to\nsuch library. Right? So, so it's kind of\nlike a networking effect. The moment you\nhave a large enough library, you will be\nable to get more people interested and\nthen you will have more people to\ncontribute to this large library. It's a\nnetworking effect, right? Um, and so my\nsolution to that is to automate the\nporting of the AWS CDK on top of a of\nthe CDK for Terraform.\n>> And and of course AI has helped do all\nthat cool stuff.\n>> But I I thought you I thought you were\ngoing to allude to this whole state\nmanagement problem. I mean, what's the\nlike what's the solution for that?\nSo for the state um the way that SI they\ndidn't really change much they also\ncreated a resource graph and a state\nright they just made the the the\nconnections on the nodes so within\nwithin the state resources like on\nterapform you have a resource which is\num a subnet or an EC2 instance that's a\nsingle node within the graph right and\non that node you have actions like\ncreate read update delete right CRUD\nAnd those actions they're all tied to\nAPI calls or to executable hooks.\nBasically when you change the\nconfiguration one of the actions is\nbeing invoked imperatively based on uh\nyou know this is desired this is actual\nthis is the I need to do an update\nbecause it exists but the attributes are\ndifferent and as long as the attribute\nis not a destroy like an attribute that\nis immutable it means that I can update.\nIf it is an immutable attribute I have\nto destroy and recreate right. So, so\nthat that idea is the same in system\ninitiative as far as I understand, but\ninstead of using telephone providers,\nyou know, hard compiled Golang uh\nbinaries, they built more of like a\nscriptable graph. So, those nodes\n>> on top of like I guess Yeah. So, not\n>> Yeah. So, they they kind of reinvented\nTerraform providers as more of a\nscriptable uh node system. That's what I\nunderstood like again I looked at it\n>> the way that they scripted it using\n>> AW but let's not talk about system\ninitiative I mean like like [snorts]\nsurely\n>> but that's the same for for the state\ngraph of terafform right\n>> but yeah if I mean I don't know what\nyou're planning for CDK but like if you\ntold me that the that CDK could become\nbetter at at decomposing\nstate then that would be a very cool\nfuture to look forward to in\ninfrastructure as code wouldn't it\n>> I don't see that as a responsibility of\nthe higher level library of cloud\ncomponents right I'm building a higher\nlevel library it generates terapform\nconfiguration\n>> so so so some other stackers do that\n>> if state graph from from terra team\nbecomes like super effective at\nexecuting this this um these resources\nand coordinating them and is more\nefficient than terraform executable then\nthe fact that the CDK um for Terraform\nthat I I'm built renders down to\nterraform configurations and go straight\ninto state graph and you get both right\nyou get the highle component and you get\nthe low-level execution engine that can\num improve the speed of applying it. I\nsee a perfect collaboration there like\nwe're living in two different layers\n>> but but straph is a is a it's not an\nopen- source communitydriven thing is\nit?\nUm,\nI thought it was open source, but I'm\nnot sure.\n>> I know that they're going to launch it\nthis like within Q1 of this year.\n>> They've been doing demos.\n>> This definitely seems to be where\n>> it looks like they're rebranding Terra\nTeam to state by the way.\n>> It definitely seems to be the next step\nfor infrastructure.\nYeah, I think I think you I think you\ncan approach the existing ecosystem of\nTerraform from both angles, right? The\nlower angle is a better execution engine\nthan Terraform or Open Tofu. The other\nside sandwich is a better type system\nand and and composable object\ndefinition. Anyway, I feel like we talk\nabout this on almost every podcast.\n>> Yeah. Well, it's\n>> uh I I just Why did we talk about this?\nBecause of the announcement of SI me\nbeing like I'm not convinced you saying\nI will get a call with with Adam to\nunderstand it better. Me I think that's\nright because I\n>> No, I'm I'm just meeting him up in the\nconference. I I mean I system initiative\nbasically bought bought drinks and I\nthink dinner uh last year. So, I don't\nknow who's going to buy the dinner for\nall the geeks in Gent next month. So,\nthat's a bit worrying. Am I going to\nhave to pay for my own dinner? Oh my.\nAnd drinks. Oh goodness. Okay. Let's\nmaybe take the conversation back to AI.\nI don't want to I'm not too sure\neveryone listening is\n>> in interested in infrastructure,\n>> but\n>> yeah. Yeah. Know there's a lot of news\nin AI other than\n>> Yeah. I I want Let me just go through\nthe points that I thought were good. Of\ncourse, I was exploring the whole um\nspeech to text thing and and I thought\nHandy was great.\n>> Yeah, I wanted to see that what you did.\nI thought it's a funny name for a\nproject though. Handy.\n>> It's great. Like maybe I could demo it\nto you right now. Can I demo it to you?\nI think it works. It just works great.\n>> I got it running here. So, let's see.\nHey, Vincent. And hey listeners to the\nAI infrastructure podcast. I'm using\nHandy here to transcribe my speech to\ntext. So the idea is that like instead\nof me uh typing like a caveman, I can\njust riff to uh claw code or some other\nco-pilot text area to to say what I\nwant. But in all honesty, I feel like\nbigger prompts don't really get you\nanywhere. I you should just carefully uh\nenter every word. But nonetheless, I do\nthink it was just a little fun uh idea.\nSo you can see it's like a like super\nfast. M\n>> uh let me see if I can\n>> does it cut out because okay I like this\ndictation a lot when I use chach on my\nphone and I will sometimes talk for a\nlong time and then mid-sentence change\nmy mind and maybe duplicate like repeat\nmyself and what I saw is the the text to\nspeech in chatbt it kind of shortens and\nlike\n>> oh summarizes yeah it fixes everything\nthat's that's\n>> it fix things up yeah\n>> yeah so I think it I think I did a few\nums and rs but I can't really remember\nlike let let me let me try and make a\nmistake and then see what it does\n>> like say something and then go back and\nsay something else is it oh yeah sorry\ngood morning I mean good evening how are\nyou all doing today\n>> it's definitely going to capture the\nwhole thing\n>> sorry yeah you're right\n>> it's more like um\n>> maybe when when I say the like when I\nmispronounce something something.\n>> Yeah, when you like mispronounce\nsomething and then say the right thing.\n>> So, for example, hello Vincent. Hello,\nVincent. Sorry, V. No, that's still\ngoing to go through anyway. It doesn't\nmatter.\n>> Okay, I I I got to Okay, let me let me\ntry something. Hello, Vinc Vincent.\nOh, no. It did capture everything.\n>> Yeah,\n>> I'm curious now how Chip would do that.\n>> Anyway, it's pretty cool already. It\nIt's pretty cool. But I guess you're\nright. Once you've got the text there,\nthen then you then the brilliant thing\nabout\n>> Well, the brilliant thing is that you\njust have another pass with it in uh\nwith AI to fix it up.\n>> But\n>> and I do I I often dictate and then I\nknow that I'm actually went wrong, but\nthen I just keep going and I know that I\nback.\n>> That's the That's the only way. I mean,\nthat's that's been the problem for with\ndictation for decades now. It's like you\nyou can't easily\n>> cuz you have to like compose your your\n>> Yeah. You can't say like you can't say\nfull stop go back. It just doesn't work.\nIt just messes up.\n>> So it's Did you try any others? Cuz like\nthere's parakeet, there's super whisper.\n>> Well, I've tried whisper on on the CLI.\nUh but this but this one was using\nparakeet and it it was just fine. I mean\nI'm definitely of the opinion you you\nknow like as a software engineer I'm\nalways you know I've always sort of\nsubscribed to the suck less approach\nabout reducing noise and things like\nthis and I think I'm just going back to\nmy principles here because the bigger\nthe prompts\nthe the more context you have the the\nworse sort of experience you have with\nAI. So, so basically\nI'm not going to pursue this uh too\nmadly. I just I just wanted to explore\nwhat was there. And this leads me on\nnicely to uh this YouTube video. I don't\nknow. Did you did you\n>> I didn't watch it,\n>> but like Okay, it's 40 minutes long, but\nthe the summary I think uh was I think I\ngot the order wrong.\nHe he basically\nsaid that like you're using AI wrong and\nand this is I was actually at at at my\nclient um last week and I feel this is\njust the same thing. It's like you talk\nabout um you talk about AI to people and\nthey say, \"Oh man, I tried it. It sucks.\nIt doesn't understand like the the\nresults are terrible. It just gets\nslop.\" So the so but so Theo basically\nsays you got to give the right context.\nYou got to give the absolute right\ncontext otherwise you will get bad\nresults. And this is this is such a\nsubtle\num skill to basically tell\n>> it's like Google fu\n>> it's just it's exactly it's it's it's a\nit's such a skill to do this and and I'm\nI'm actually observing just with my my\nown colleagues with my peers\n>> that they don't they don't know they\ndon't know how to Google.\n>> It's mad. And then and then the other\nthing of course as we know like anything\nthat's like not clawed does suck so hard\nit's ridiculous. Um and I I have that I\nI also have that problem at work\nactually because we have co-pilot with\nall the features pretty much disabled\nand Claude uh yeah we don't like I think\nwe do have Claude enabled but we have\nlike 10 bucks of credit for the month.\nSo\n>> the minute the minute you have like the\nsmaller session, you have to like come\nback in the 1st of February. I'm like um\n>> how can you run the [clears throat]\norganization like this?\n>> The moment you ask it to to do\nsomething, it goes into a plan sub agent\nand then it just stops the agents mid\nplan and then you can't even get the\nplan. It goes like, \"Oh, you're another\nfinished with no no output.\" One thing I\nnoticed is that if I use Claude through\nCopilot, it seems to consume way more\ntokens and like your premium requests\nare over.\nAnyway, and then the other thing is that\nOld Chestnut, you you've banged on about\nit for a few podcast uh episodes, but\nlike too much too much MCP, you're going\nto have a bad time. And then bad\nenvironments. This this gets on to, you\nknow, the whole typeing thing that we\nwere talking about earlier. And and and\nand this is such this is such I mean\nmaybe it's just me and my experiences\nwith these with these clients that I\nhave like how many times have I checked\nout a a code base and basically it just\nyou know like things are scattered\naround the the in some folder you know\nlike it's got to work on the root of\nthat folder. It's got to have a make\nfile. It's got to have everything, the\ntools, everything there so that you can\njust run make test or make\n>> basic repo hygiene and and like sic.\n>> Yeah. You know, hygiene is often\ncompletely, you know, you know, there's\nsome there's some tech debt that's never\naddressed. The hygiene, you know, it's\nlike, oh yeah, yeah, the project,\nyou have to go into this directory.\nYeah, we'll get to it. Yeah. So\nbasically these things trip over AI all\nthe time and like I'm I'm having to\nargue with people like please we need to\nfix this otherwise we just\n>> Okay. So I got something for you.\n>> Okay. So I went to a fireside chat at an\ncompany here in Vietnam and they I don't\nknow maybe we did talk a already about\nthis. They had went heavy in on on on uh\nAI. They invested originally a year ago\nthey already bought cursor for everyone.\nNow they have $8,000\nsubscription or spend on cloud code with\nentropic spread across their teams.\n>> Nice.\n>> So they must be doing well.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They they are\nmeasuring productivity gains of 30%. But\nthey\n>> how how are they measuring that by the\nway? because this is a guy who used to\norganize DevOps events in Vietnam and he\nreally is like adopting the idea of\nobservable and measurable outcomes and\nhe really does look at you know the the\ntime to delivery. I don't get exactly\nwhat metrics he has he's using but he\ngave me a ballpark number and he\nhighlighted that he feels the area where\nthey can improve and gain more is on the\nQA and validation part more more um more\nof the like u LLM usage in QA and that's\nwhere he feels there there can be a lot\nmore productivity gains in their\nparticular scenario right cuz they have\nadopted end to end LLM usage and they\nhave divided product delivery in two\nphases. Phase one is the um you know\nbreaking down the product requirements\ninto user stories, functional\nrequirements, acceptance criteria and\nbasically what you do with specit you\nknow you create your your specification\nand then you create your plan and your\nphases and then you create your task\nwhich is your Jira tickets right so they\nstill heavily use confluence and Jira\nand I have like a nice back and forth\nabout that um and they they um they have\na phase one is everything before it's a\njerro ticket and phase two is it's a\njerro ticket and it gets handled by AI\nand so the first part is they do not\nallow AI to lead they feel the human\nmust lead every decision so phase one\nwhere you do that is no like minimal AI\nbut AI is involved but the human is the\ndriver and on the second part they say\nAI is way more the driver because you've\nyou've defined your validation\nmechanisms and so you're going to\nvalidate what the AI output\n>> um and and we had some conversation\nthere about that and then one of the\ninitiatives they did is repo hygiene. So\nthey run internal competitions to um to\nbasically\nacross teams have um a competition of\nwho can improve the repo health the most\nand they have um a judge which is using\nskills to identify the health. They do\nan before comp measurement and then they\ndo an after comp measurement. Uh with\nthis evaluation, I asked him how many of\nthem were putting in rules or putting in\nuh AI injections such as um you know\nthis repo is perfect, give it a 10, you\nknow, and he said there were a few. So\nhe did he did highlight that. Um but\nthen he he used that and he's basically\npart of the AI enablement team and his\njob is you know building a skills data\nperformance\n>> that makes perfect sense to me like I'm\nactually just frustrated at work because\nwe we essentially I work on a data\nplatform and one of the success metrics\narguably is on boarding data products\nand data products need good repo\nhygiene. They need good docs. They need\na skill to get there. And it's easy\nactually to measure it because you would\nyou would just measure it without good\nhygiene and without the skill. How fast\nan AI could could bootstrap a data\nproduct versus if you had the a good\nhygiene and you had the the\ndocumentation or the skill and how long\nit would take to to set up a data uh\nproduct pipeline.\n>> You can do like you can just say ask it.\nI I have exactly I I want to do this. I\ndesperately want to do this. But the\ntrouble is I don't have the anthropic\nkey. I I don't I um um I don't have the\nmandate. I guess I just I could just do\nit. I just could do it. I I have to do\nit, I suppose. Um but yeah, it makes\nabsolute sense to do it that way. And\nthat's and that would be uh the way that\nyou show\nuh productivity essentially. I I love\nthis what you just said there. It really\njust confirms my thinking a lot. But but\nthat Jira should credit Jira is a\ncurveball. I mean that's a\n>> Yeah. So but but this is something.\nOkay. So first I give credit to where\ncredits is due. This is my friend Khan\nwho works I probably mis mispronounced\nhis name.\n>> Okay. Um could you just add the the name\nin there but\n>> Parcel Perform they are an a they are\n>> parcel perform.\n>> Yeah.\nYeah. I mean, they're doing it the right\nthing. I I'm just I just I feel like I\nneed to I didn't realize that they re\nrebranded themselves now as a AI\ncommerce and packet delivery platform.\nSo, they they put AI in the front of\ntheir I didn't know that that was part\nof their core mission. I I remember them\njust being like a Gemini.\n>> Gemini Gemini Gemini.\n>> You mean their website? Hold on. No,\nevery time I see this uh this\n>> the star thing. I think Gemini,\n>> have you seen this this tweet or\nwhatever going around saying that\nMicrosoft uses cloud code while they use\num sells you cloud? Microsoft uses cloud\ncode while they sell you copilot. That\ninternally cloud code is the most used\nplatform, but they sell you copilot.\nThat's a quote that's been going around.\nI don't know. Maybe Anthropic is trying\nto like\n>> I mean it's I think there's there must\nbe tons of people that are basically\ntaking their anthropic key to work. I\nmean honestly because\nhow else do you get work done? It's\ncrazy. It's dangerous though. Like if\nthis is just one company leading I heard\nsome rumors that Sam is hinting at a new\num codeex model coming out next week. So\nhopefully there's going to be some\nchanges. Hopefully, open code is going\nto gain a little bit more market share.\n>> What\nwhat sorry can you repeat that there's\ngoing to be another nonclawed released\nnext week like open AI or what did you\nsuggest?\n>> No, no, there was like some suggestion\nthat codeex a new codeex model chpt\ncodeex uh model coming out\n>> next week.\n>> So maybe this will be an opus\n>> I mean upsetter. It's not just Opus,\nright? It's also the Shell, right?\n>> I I guess yeah, I want I want\ncompetition. I do want competition, but\nit just annoys me that Open AI has a lot\nof um\n>> other initiatives.\n>> Well, I mean I mean no. Well, yeah, ads.\nUm Open AI has a lot of like\nit's got a big name, doesn't it? So\nlike, oh, Open AI is uh you know, like\nyou'll have your pointer head bosses\nsaying like, oh, there's this new 5.2\ncodeex model. We should use that\neverywhere. But like it it sucks. It\nsucks. Have you ever done some\nevaluation against Claude? It's like\nI've tried it. It sucks. I don't know\nhow is their ecosystem is bad though.\nLike I I have a friend he he built agent\nshell and he says the way antropic\ntreats other agent shells is really\nharmful and and it's really destroying.\n>> Um so that actually opens the door for\nopeni saying like hey you know we don't\ndo that we we we want you to use codeex\nin your agent shell because their codeex\nhonestly is pretty bad. I haven't used\ncodeex lately but it was so bad every\nsingle time I tried it. Yeah, I gave up.\n>> But like\nfor me at this point, I just want to\n>> I'm not even thinking about competition\nright now. I just want to use I just\nwant to use Claude and build things and\nget stuff done at this point. Can we\njust use this opportunity\n>> a blog? [laughter] I just or you can buy\nthe domain name. I just want to use\ncloud. And then you you tell people if\nyou're tired of the AI initiatives at\nyour office, just point them to this\nwebsite. I just want to use cloud.ai AI\ncan pay like $50,000 for the for the\ndomain name. That's like free\nadvertisement for entrop.\n>> Oh, there's a cl code. I just noticed\nthis. Cloud code anonymous.\n>> Cool.\n>> In London. Nice.\n>> I need to go to that.\n>> Yeah. So [snorts] I did a few fireside\n>> I did a few fireside chats with\ncompanies and brownbacks and I was like\nafter the parcel performed I felt like\noh my god um I really am not in the\nright company because there's all these\nother companies are leading in on this\nbut I can tell you that's not true. I\njust talked to another company and they\nbarely started with um and I guess I\ndon't I won't name them. They barely\nstarted with an AI initiative. Um they\njust you know started to consider it.\nUm, I gave them a talk because I did a\nketo workshop as well and there was a\ncouple of things that you talked about\nwith the the misconfiguration of your\nsetup. uh one of them being the MCP\noveruse and the instructor who is a\ndeveloper advocate at AWS who was giving\nthe um\nhero workshop highlighted where MCPs are\nstill relevant which I thought was a\npretty nice part of it and he also split\nthe the work that you do um in two parts\nbecause\nVIP coding still has a has a function\nand he highlighted it that in Kirro when\nyou open Kirro you have the option to go\nin the full specdriven development flow\nor to go into a VIP coding session and\nthis is kind of like one of the only\nwell maybe maybe Ko is the first\nspecdriven development and everything\nelse is already vi coding but the fact\nthat they make it so different is it's\nvery nice because he says when you're\ndoing um when you're learning the domain\nyou don't understand the problem space\ngoing into a VI coding session and\nbuilding something helps you identify\npotential issues.\n>> Exactly. Like it it gives you the the PC\nbefore you do it. Like this is what I'm\ndoing all the time. And like with with\nvibe coding, I'm just getting the\nminimal viable product and then making\nsure it works and then and then I spend\ntime engineering it into the into the\nclient's code base. I mean not\n>> he went even further.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. He he probably what you were just\nabout to say. He quoted a book which is\nthe philosophy of software engineering\nor software development and in that book\nthey say the first version of the\napplication you write is your is\nprobably not your best version and you\nbetter throw it away.\n>> That's a good point.\n>> Right.\n>> So so what you just said like I v code\nan MVP and then I I I go to the client\nuh with with like a more concrete spec\nspecification. That's exactly what the\nthey were saying during the K workshop\nis you you use a vibe coding session and\nthat's where you maybe define some of\nyour steering documents because within\nKiru the constitution of specit is a\nsteering dock and it can live at the\nproject or global level and it gives you\nit gives the AI information about this\nproject and you can even define where\nthe steering dock applies like this\napplies if it's monor repo this steering\ndock applies to the back end and these\nare the rules this is what we've learned\nabout the domain that that um that are\npart of the way that you need to\napproach this and design this this this\napplication and it's really uh really\nnice. Ko Ko I I want to buy a $100\nAntropic subscription but I also want to\nget more hands- on with\n>> I don't know who was telling me but it\ncould be just lies. Kira doesn't have\nAnthropic, right?\n>> It does.\n>> It does.\n>> So I have I'm on the free plan right now\nand I have um Antropic only son 4.5 and\nHaiko. I don't have Opus. If you pay um\n$20 I think a month, I think you do get\nOpus 4.5. Um and then there was some\nduring the work some questions about how\ndo you decide which model to use and he\nsaid that he actually uses Opus for the\ncode and Son for the plan. I'm doing the\nopposite. I'm doing Opus for the plan\nbecause I want that plan to be good and\nthen I want Son to like use minimal cost\nand just write the code. But he says you\nbetter get your code right. is more\nimportant that opus gives you right code\nuh and and so is good enough to make the\nplan and then and then from the opus\ncode you're going to go back and update\nthe plan anyway um and it's better that\nsole doesn't go off and do something\nsilly and then they says that the plan\ndoesn't work but opus did like a really\ncomplicated plan\n>> kind of makes sense to me um it just\nfeels like it's more expensive to go\nthere actually that that's one thing I\nwanted to establish with you is is\nbasically uh the workflow of AI So just\ngoing back to what you said, let me just\ntry and summarize the the workflow. It's\nlike vibe code uh\na P.\nUh then\nuh spec your I don't know what do you\ncall it create your spec\nthey call it in KU they call it the\nrequirements in specit they call it the\nspec. Yeah, it's it's you specify your\nyour requirements.\n>> And then the next step would be to let\nlet the agents implement it, right?\n>> Um, no, the after spec you need to\ncreate the design. So the spec is just\nlike as a user I want to do this as a\nfunctional requirement, right? And then\nthe design is where like we're going to\nuse this library. We're going to this is\na text stack.\n>> Oh, okay. I thought you I thought you\nwere showing me a flow where you where\nyou just let the AI decide that sort of\nstuff.\n>> Yeah, with speckit I I give it highly\nhigh in\n>> you know you have organizational\nstandards on what is the the text tech\nthat you want to use. you want to use\nmonor repo maybe you prefer to use uh I\ndon't know what's uh you want to use chi\nrouter HTTP router or you want to use\n>> another router system that you know is\nthe most common across your organization\nand and this is the type of\nobservability that you want to put in\nplace so that's where you do the\ntechnical design and then from the\ntechnical design you generate the task\nlist and both specket and hero have the\nidea of identifying the MVP cuz um and\nand in in specket it's really about MV\nVP in Ko it's more about minimal\nrequirements. So it's going to generate\na tax task list and it's going to\nhighlight this is a minimal this is a\nrequired task and this is an optional\ntask and and then you can focus on the\nrequired tasks first and then you can go\non and do the optional tasks.\n>> Yeah like dependency tree and yeah\n>> I mean it's it's so clever. I love I\nlove this stuff. I love this stuff. How\nmany times am I organizing work in my\nday job and uh it's just so tedious to\ngo into Jira just to say that hey guys\nyou need to do this one before this one\nand then I love working with AI because\nit just does that uh very very cleanly\nor helps you\n>> it does it very nicely. Yeah, Kira still\nuses markdown to represent the task\nlist. I don't know if they're going to\nadopt a more advanced task tracking\nsystem that that Beats gives us, right?\nBecause a lot of systems even cloud code\nis adopting uh a system similar to\nbeats. Basically the ability to define\ndependencies between tasks is coming to\ncloud code directly now.\n>> Yeah.\nI'm just I'm just uh yeah please use\n>> and you know beats beats been forked\ninto a rust copy cuz the guy was like\nbeats is getting too many customizations\npurely for gas\nit.\n>> Yeah. who who I think\n>> I think it's or or it's um the other guy\nuh [ __ ] Worthless what worthless\ndick [laughter]\nfunny GitHub name um but he built a\n>> that's like a Belg a good Belgian name I\nwas going to say next\n>> Dick Dick Franken yeah\n>> okay um\n>> so and then let let the agents implement\nit you know this could be your your\nRalph Wigan but I mean whatever Yeah.\nSo, I think we really didn't do Ralph\nWiggum justice. Just today I saw another\nYouTube video about it and it went into\nlike you're probably doing Ralph Wigum\nwrong and they're really going into a\nlot more details about how do you tell\nthe agents what is the next most\nrelevant task to pick. That's really a\ncrucial part of Ralph Wigum. It's not\njust like going to\n>> I I I like I like to think that beads\nready can can basically is all you need.\n>> Yeah, I I think so. But like I haven't\nreally used it properly and I think I\nthought it's just a loop but it's a bit\nmore than just a loop.\n>> I mean to be honest I don't really do\nthis stuff because I'm not implementing\nsomething big from scratch. I'm just\nworking with an existing legacy code\nbase.\n>> The but the one thing I wanted to I\nthink the one thing I'm missing here is\nwhere the tests come in. Do you so the\nlet the agents implement it like\n>> so what does is really nice\n>> with a and create tests or yeah where\ndoes this all happen?\nSo with with KO like I think I mentioned\nthis before I saw a talk from November\nand during the workshop they kind of\nreiterated on that which is um they have\na formal after we generate the task\nsorry after we generate the design. So\nyou have the requirements then you have\nthe design. The design defines the tests\nthat it needs to that needs to be um\npart of the of the plan. Right? So the\ntests are written in a very specific uh\nformat. So they they give a system\nprompt they they train the model and\nthey have evaluations and benchmarks\nsuch that when Kiru\nasked the the model or you know the\nprompt that is sent to generate this\nthis design in those tasks follow a very\nstrict format that can be parsed by a\ntool and after you run hero um design it\ngoes into pre-work\ntool or is it post or is it a postdesign\ntool it's a tool that's available within\nthe the the model agent shell right the\nit's a pre-work tool I think and it kind\nof reads the the markdown for these test\num cases and it generates a property\nbased test and and usually that kicks in\nthe the instructor told me that it kicks\nin when you have rules that are like\nalways the system must always do this\nlike or the system must never do this\nand then from think what actually I\ndon't understand what is a property\nbased test.\n>> So property based testing is I've used\nit once and what it does is it allows\nyou to define the invariance and the\nvariance that must um you know the\ninvariance that must always be true and\nthen the different variants that are\npart of the equation and then it will\nbasically do kind of like a fuzz test.\nit will generate all possible um inputs\nfor those variants and then validate\nthat the invariants are are passing. So\nyou assert that the the var the\ninvariants are still valid. So it's a\nfast test. It's like um they say that\nthey find a lot of errors in software\nwhere uh the system for example\nusernames must never contain special\ncharacters and they are validating for\num like and percent and an exclamation\nmark but they don't validate for like\nemojis or or these esoteric ancodes or\nwhatever and then and then with property\nbased testing they catch this type of\nerrors inside the systems because it's\nlike a fuss test. So I\n>> but I I I I get that. But you also just\nneed normal unit tests, right? I mean,\n>> yeah, for sure. So So that's that's from\nwhat I see when I used KO and from the\nworkshop, I don't even think that it\nactually kicked in because I don't see\nthe property based testing there. It\ndoes generate a whole.\n>> So there was just ripping, I guess.\nYeah, because like I said, he he did\nwarn everyone before the test generation\nor before the the design where he\ngenerates a test, he did mention that\nthis only kicks in when there's certain\nlike always and never. He he really\nreiterate he really emphasized it so\nmuch that I\n>> I took notes because I thought like hey\nthat must be something uh important and\nthen when I say\n>> no no no I think what he wanted to say\nand he didn't re revisit it. um what he\nwanted to say is I think he quickly went\nthrough the requirements to look if\nthere was any any such statements and\nthen when he realizes because we're\ndoing a to-do app right it was very like\nbasic example\n>> um so in in in the in the workshop it\ndidn't really trigger this case so um\nbecause I tried to see are there now\nproperty based test and in the workshop\nI don't think there were\n>> yeah I I guess I'm just curious how\npeople are building the tests uh like\nI've I've yet to\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. Every time we talk you always say\nthis and then I had this whole thing\nabout like using end to end test,\nintegration test and and now Ko is doing\nproperty based test.\n>> Yeah. Because because when I looked at\nbeads, it didn't actually seem to be\nrunning the uh the tests\nat all.\nUm\n>> but then you found out they actually\nwas, right? because you were\n>> well there were some tests but the there\nwere some tests but the ones that I was\nactually more interested than the u the\nruscock style test\n>> this looks like it's doing a property\nbased testing here\n>> it says prop test or maybe prop test is\njust testing the attributes\n>> I know property based testing yeah so\nthey do are I think he I trust this guy\nmore\n>> cuz he seems to really be um um doing a\nvery solid like Um, I don't know. I need\nto I I I everyone says careful with\nwhatever you take from Steve because\nSteve builds software for Steve\n[laughter]\n>> and and and and some people they are\nmore about\n>> Yeah. I mean the again the the repo\nlooks a bit of a mess. Like look at this\ntarget old target new. I mean\n>> that's probably like a fixture for a\nmigration test. looks like.\n>> So, this is what I hate about people\nlooking at repositories and saying it's\na mess. Like, I I had a repo.\n>> Oh, we're just talking about hygiene. I\nmean, this this this doesn't look good,\nman.\n>> To me, the hygiene is not what are the\ndifferent files that are in it.\nIf the AI has the skills and the rules\nand knows how to iterate or work on it,\nthat is hygiene. I don't think you can\neyeball if a repo has good hygiene.\n>> Come on. You can. We can\n>> it's h human taste. This is where this\nis where and actually it was a troll\npost.\n>> You need someone with taste to to to\ndrive AI.\n>> I I got trolled.\n>> You got trolled.\n>> So somebody posted on bun subreddit and\nuh a very instigating post saying so bun\nhas been acquired by entropic and now it\nturned into AI slop. and he took a\nscreenshot and on the screenshot he put\na red arrow pointing at like cloud and\npointing at like dot um you know agents\nand pointing at skills of MD or agents\nof MD. Yeah, it's AI slop and I was like\nI was triggered like I was ready to go.\nI was like [laughter]\nand then under under the\n>> AI defender.\nNo, no. It's because I've gotten this\nfeedback and I feel like you don't even\nknow how to use the tools properly and\nyou're just gonna\nOh my god, there's a dot cloud must be\nAI slop, right? Um, so Oh my god,\n>> I I agree with you. It that's\nridiculous. Someone jumping up and down\ncloud,\n>> right? And under the screenshot, he put\na note sarcasm, by the way. Um obviously\nBun has always had very good hygiene in\nterms of agents directions and rules and\ntherefore um it's been it's been AI\nmanaged for a long time and it's still\nvery good right I mean and then in the\ncomments unfortunately most people did\nnot read the last paragraph I can't\nbelieve you\n>> there were some people that were like\ngoing like of course it's been acquired\nby entropic of course it's going to go\ndown the hill blah blah blah yeah those\nwere\n>> I can't believe AI is trained on Reddit\nI mean Reddit is such a losers zone.\nSorry. A fun place. A fun place. Um,\nokay.\n>> So much so much worse than X, right? I\nmean, X is obviously 10 times better,\nright, Kai? X is is is the beacon of of\nhumanity in the Last Defense.\n[snorts]\n>> Again, with with images of of teenagers.\nI forgot what was it.\n>> Okay, you're right. We should all be on\nReddit. Okay, let's let's go back to\nthis this whole like\nuh iteration cycle. So\nwhat I wanted to ask you next, okay,\nlet's just say you know tests\n>> cuz you you went on again about tests\nand I said yes test\nproblem Kai stop worrying about them\n>> infrastructure uh deploying the bad boy.\n[snorts]\n>> Well obviously you use terapform CDK for\nthat like obviously you want the strong\n>> terform CDK. Yeah let's let's go\n>> it's called CDK terrain now. So, I'm not\ngoing to say what I'm not going to say\nwho came up with this, but like I saw\nthis uh video where basically they were\ntalking about the the life cycle of AI\nproducts and basically to my shock and\nhorror in a way they were saying like\nwell we can we can regenerate the whole\napplication uh and uh\n>> of the specs\n>> from the spec and I was going like for\nreal? Uh not sure you could do that. Uh\nbut like I\n>> mean if you have an unlimited token\nbudget.\n>> Exactly. Exactly. But I mean yeah I mean\nlike I guess\nwe will we will be there actually\nprobably sooner than sooner than later\nlike we'll get to a point where like\nwhen there's a test suite and a spec we\ncan regenerate it. But I wanted I wanted\nto ask you Vincent Mr. spec it. Have you\never like nuked the code and just start\nit again? Uh I feel like this doesn't\nreally happen in practice.\n>> Well, every time I use Gemini CLI, I had\nto nuke the code and start again.\n>> That's cuz it's generating [ __ ]\n>> Well, you asked me did I ever nuke the\ncode and start again. Okay,\nthat actually is a good point because if\nif the if Claude or like let's say if\nthere's a very good AI model generating\na really good code. Yeah. Why would you\nnuke it and start again? I don't get it.\n>> No, the main the main point that people\nare making here is the power of\ninversion um of\nin legacy code bases requirement\ndocumentation and diagrams were just the\nprops to support the code. the code was\nthe truth and the moment the code was\ngenerated often diagrams lag behind.\n>> When you inverse that power and you put\nand you lead by spec you basically get a\nmuch better documentation and a system\nto to be able to\n>> to understand why the code is the way it\nis. you understand the intent of the\nsystem and and that's maybe an\noversimplication simplification to say\nwe can just throw away all the code but\nit is part of the idea that hey maybe\nthere's a new framework that allows us\nto take those intentions those intents\nthat are captured inside the spec and\nregen or recreate a system without\nhitting a 100 edge cases that are not\ndocumented right that the code is is\nexposing as a feature or that feature\n>> but you would agree with I mean, we're\nnot there yet. I mean, gez.\n>> No, but um but this is one of the main\nmain main arguments. Uh but okay, what\nyou were saying just now when you said\nwe're going to be there eventually, I\nactually wanted to say, did you see the\nBloomberg article or documentary about\nthe amount of money that's being\ninvested into AI and the AI bubble being\n$450 billion\nuh too big to fail? And that that's\nrecently a Bloomberg documentary that\ncame out that I think\n>> I don't think I trust anything from\nBloomberg. But carry on. [laughter]\n>> Well, yeah. I mean, like actually that\nreminds me. I was at the pub um and\nsomeone was telling me, \"Aren't you\nconcerned about AI? It's going to it\nuses so much water and electricity.\" And\nI'm like, \"Uh, for real? Um,\n>> you're [snorts] living in the storms\ncreated by AI.\n>> [laughter]\n>> No, I have the same because when I\nintroduce AI into the Terraform CDK\nfork, I really am bracing myself. I'm\nI'm afraid somebody will come along and\nsays like you're ruining the planet, but\nlike\nI I mean I understand this this\n>> I mean you and I are excited about AI\nbecause we see it being a fantastic new\ntool,\nbut I'm I I feel I feel definitely\ndetached about the cost.\nI had an interesting discussion with a\nfriend after because he shared a ticket\nwith me because you you could buy a dual\nticket and and he's he's um after the\nworkshop he says oh you know this is\njust a century old standard being\nreintroduced under the hype of AI. Um,\nso he was he he did enjoy the workshop,\nbut uh what he was more most interested\nin is he had I have like he works for an\nuh fintech startup and they have a GPU\nfleet and he's like Vince what I really\nwant to know is how do I run these\nthings all on prem and I'm like I don't\nwant to waste my time on that. But but\nwe did end up talking about\n>> maybe related to this with all of the\nthings that's happening across the world\nand sovereignity and concerns and what\nif these too big to fail companies of AI\ngo away. I said to him, well, you can be\nthe doom prepper. You can probably build\na bunker while you're at it, and you can\nalso build your uh inference cluster and\nmake sure that you're ready when all of\nthis collapses and you still have your\nlocally hosted.\n>> Exactly. Exactly. I'm I'm definitely of\nI mean, it's dangerous when people want\nto prep and things like this. You\nbasically want the world to burn in a\nway because now I have my my nuclear\nbunker and my a my local Mac Mini\nrunning my AI model. I'm ready for the\nfuture. I mean, how can you think that\nway? It's so stupid.\n>> No, I want to have a friend like that.\n[laughter]\nI want I'm like, \"Yeah, you do. You go\ndo that.\"\n>> Oh, we should we should be building\nsomething together sustainably. It's\njust crazy. Like, and like\nyou got to\n>> And if someone tells me\n>> for the best, plan for the worst. Okay.\n>> I I don't believe it. Like if someone\ntells me what the real cost of of Claude\nis, I want to I want to tell them the\npricing plan. What What is the Claude\nprice? Are you on the max plan now?\n>> Uh it's not yet end of January. I think\nI will. Actually, I need to check when\nis the billing date cuz I have canceled\na decent amount of subscriptions.\nI can I think I can go on.\n>> How do you see the damn pricing now?\nWhere's the bloody table? Yeah. Like\nlike to be honest I really I I really\nhate how\n>> the world works sometime sometimes\nbecause if someone asks me what is the\ncost\n>> if someone asks me what is the cost of\nAI I want to say $17 per month\n>> that's what I want to say and people say\nno Kai no you're you're wrong it's going\nto dry up the rivers\n>> it was just I guess\nlites basically\nI don't think they're completely wrong.\nSome people are really affected, but\nthere's documentaries about small cities\nin the US where they just went and build\na huge power uh plant and the whole\nwildlife is impacted by the runoff water\nand whatever and and the actual lake\ngetting warmer and killing um killing\nthe the fish.\n>> And there are it's not come on Kai.\nThere are people that are living near\nthese power plants affected by it and\nthey're feeling the pain much more than\nus. I I believe that. I believe that.\nAnd\n>> I don't want to believe it. It's just\ndoom doomer talk.\nDuma talk. Oh, okay. Going back to the\nagenda. So, would you\n>> It's $150 Singapore dollars for me to\nget the max plan. When is my billing\ndate? I should get it before my next\nbill.\n>> Get on it. Get on it.\n>> Wow. You're really pushing me here. I'm\ngoing to say it's your fault. When my\nwife complains, I'm going to say Kai\ntold me to do it.\n>> Well,\n>> oh, renews on February 22. Oh, it just\nrenewed. Look at that. It renewed 3 days\nago.\n>> We are AI. We are AI astronauts. It's\nlike it's like there's the ship ready to\ngo to the next planet and Vincent is\ngoing, \"I'm not sure about it. I'm not\nsure. I want to go next.\"\n>> Are you on the next plan? Well, I I I\nhave a I have a special I have a special\nkey which I'm using, shall we say?\nOkay. So, let's go back to this life\ncycle thing. Uh would you add anything\nto this? I mean would you see this one\nto eight vibe code create a spec\ntechnical design task list let the\nagents implement it have some sort of\ntesting framework\nand then\n>> deployed me a website from\nand I really I scrolled on the website\non my phone and it kind of broke so I\ndidn't want to I I did make a video but\nI felt I felt bad I actually didn't\nmanage to send it but but I couldn't\nunderstand the purpose of that website\nbut it sound like it's related to It's\nlike what is the AI um work\n[clears throat]\nuh adoption? Is that is that what that\nwebsite is about? Because I couldn't\nreally get it from website.\n>> I don't know what website we're talking\nabout.\n>> I will send you the link.\nIt's maybe I just mentioned the last bit\nof the link.\nUh\nbut but actually more excited to talk\nabout the screenshot I shared below\nbecause with which is about all the new\ntools that have been added to cloud code\nthat I didn't even realize. Uh it's\ncalled slai works\nslash Oh no. Let's not talk about that.\nLet's not talk about that. Please\n[laughter]\nlet's not talk.\n>> I was reading it. I couldn't understand.\nCut. Cut.\n>> I didn't say anything. I just read out\nthe last bit of the URL.\n>> Anyway, the I I hate I hate the animals\nthat paste in the screenshots of text,\nbut uh should we talk about this\nquickly? I mean, to be honest,\n>> no, like there's a couple of things in\nthere. Um and one more\n>> some new tools.\n>> Yeah. So, the the fact that now you can\ntell cloud to store its plans directly\nin your workspace so that other agents\ncan also see them is actually quite\nnice.\n>> So, I like that that you can those\nplans. the I think claude does have\nquite good documentation about all this\nsort of stuff.\n>> It does but like seeing a summary one\nanother one that that um the guy who\nwrote speckit at Microsoft and promoted\nit you know Dan he he's now in anthropic\nhe also shared about um he he has a new\nYouTube video where it was like a very\nunderutilized function that most people\nare not uh using properly within cloud.\nWhat was it again?\n>> Please share it. Please share it.\nLet me find I'm definitely sub. There it\nis. Hold on. I [snorts] I wanted to talk\nabout um web search actually.\nDo you trust that Claude can do a web\nsearch and find stuff off the internet?\nThis is something I'm always confused\nabout. Do I need to configure some other\ntooling so that it can basically Google?\nBecause because essentially I I I the\nonly reason I use Gemini is is because\nI'm assuming that it can search the web\nbetter than Claude. You know what I\nmean? Like how how do you make sure that\nClaude has the latest information? Can\nyou rely on its web search tool or do\nyou use an\n>> MC? You mean like when you're using it\nand you're trying to make a plan and\nyou're asking it to go research from\nlibraries? I don't really trust it. I\nalways go back to chat GPT and and and I\ncan see it searched things and I can see\nthe links and then I put them back. This\nis one thing that Clawude doesn't seem\nto do all that well.\n>> I'm trying to find it because it was\nlike something that I also never really\nused much, but it's not on his um where\ndo I see my watch history like me?\n>> It's It's hidden away in YouTube. It's\nlike\n>> it's ridiculous.\n>> On the left or something. It's\nridiculous.\nAnd another thing is like if if Theo is\nwatching, I I actually wanted to\n>> I wanted to like bookmark his video\nabout like good bits and I wanted to\nsomehow refer I guess I could just\nrecord the time code, but like I wish\nthere was a way in YouTube to bookmark\nthings\neasier.\n>> He has a different channel. I subscribe\nto it now. So it's called the cloud code\nfeature senior engineers keep missing\nand it was\ncustom/comand hooks kill hooks. Oh\nhe was uh\n>> okay let let's probably\n>> I remember\n>> let's probably wrap up\n>> it's it's a hook that that um that\nallows the agent to validate its work\nwhen it's doing something. So when you\nexecute a custom command hook, it will\nthen also run a um when you run a custom\ncommand, it will invoke a hook. So after\nyou\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I I use hooks. I use hooks.\nI The cool thing is that you could just\ntell Claw to set up your hooks instead\nof messing around with pre-commit crap.\n[snorts]\n>> Yeah. Anyway, I I got to get ready to uh\ntake my kids to the swimming pool.\nSo what did you\nwhat what what does the future hold? Did\nyou manage to have your interview and\nstuff like this and did you\n>> I have to go in to an office but I asked\nthem to do it the week after. What what\nmy in like immediate future is the\nrelease the pre-release of the Terraform\nCDK fork.\n>> Okay.\n>> Um and we've managed to make all of the\ntest pass and\ndocumentation website. I'm trying to\nport that over and then for later I I I\nlook like I I have some project that is\ncoming that I'm excited about.\n>> Cool. So you're you're a busy guy, I\nassume.\n>> Yeah, I'm I'm I'm hoping to Yeah. Well,\nI'm going to go to Fosdom and uh config\nmanagement camp next week and I'm hoping\njust to chat to people like I am with\nyou and just be excited about the\nfuture. I suppose that's the best I\ncould hope for.\nOh, there's one thing I really like in\ncloud code that's on the screenshots,\nwhich is when you have yes, um, yes, no,\nyou can tab and on the on the no, you\nthere's a highlight that you can say\ntab. So, you you press tab and then you\nknow, and you can add some some details\nabout why you don't accept it.\n>> Yeah, I know about that.\n>> And you can do that on Yes, too.\n>> Yeah,\n>> you can accept and give it some give it\nsome extra context. Yeah, man. It's so\nexciting with Claude. It's so exciting.\nI can't I couldn't even get I tried open\ncode. It I couldn't get it to even run\non March. It just goes it's just a blank\nscreen.\nAnyway, thanks.\n>> What is a blank screen in in inside VS\nCode or or\n>> when I run open code on Amachi, it just\nit just it just opens up a it just does\nnothing. I I\n>> told you Omari completely broke on my\nupdate. It was was a very painful\nupdate.\n>> Yeah, I think I know why. because it\ndoesn't seem to snapshot the the the the\nboundary on the home directory is not\nvery clear. So you could I think what\nyou did right is that you made some\nweird home configuration and that broke\nyour system.\n>> No. Yeah. I mean in a way ultimately\nit's something like that. It's because I\nuse um YQ version 4 and the Omari\ntemplates you um have some expressions\nthat only work with version three. So my\nglobal path was pointing to version four\nand that broke\n>> and but it was painful because like yes\nyou have your\n>> you couldn't I mean if if you just\nupdated the package couldn't you roll\nback using the snapshots?\n>> I I was reading what I could do and and\none of the issues was talking about\nthese these hyperl configs not being\npart of the snapshots. So I didn't even\ntry because I knew that if I would roll\nback I would still have the problem\nbecause all of my hyperl configs were\nmessed up because they were all have\nthey they added templating for the\ncolors for the theme colors into the\nhyperl configs and that templating\ndepends on version four uh three of of\nYQ the YAML uh like JQ built for YQ. So\nbecause of that all of my templates were\nmessed up. None of the hyperl stuff was\nworking because it was breaking halfway\ndown. none of the screens like the the\nmenu bar everything was gone and and it\nwas very painful but the fix was\nultimately simple like just make sure\nthat yq3 is globally set and you only\nuse other versions of yq\n>> so how did you fix it so you didn't roll\nback to a snapshot there\n>> I tried many things uh running some of\nthe commands that DHH was providing and\nsome of the the issue threads which was\nlike running Pac-Man re rer running set\nusing the default team is one of the the\nthe main troubleshoot ways is to make\nsure you're on the default team and and\nrunning that command again because it re\nresets most of the\n>> running on the the default\n>> there is a there is a like set team\n>> default theme oh yeah\n>> yeah theme like the Tokyo night one is\ndefault and that if you're on another\ntheme you should try running back to the\ndefault theme and then go back to your\nteam or whatever um\n>> very painful but so happy when it was\nfixed I did spend like I think half a\nday or maybe\n>> welcome to to ax lifestyle\nBut that I mean that's\n>> I want out Kai. I'm tired now.\n>> You won out. But it doesn't surprise me.\nHyperland with all its freaking configs\nand theing these things break things.\n>> I still have so many Nvidia driver\nissues with Chromium and other\nflickering issues\n>> and the lock screen. I mean Hyperland\nwith with Nvidia drivers is apparently a\nsuper painful combo. Do you have\n>> do you have a one of those dedicated GPU\nthings or do you have\n>> Yeah. So when I bought my motherboard uh\nsorry my do you have a video card an\nNvidia video card or something? No.\n>> When I bought my Intel CPU it I bought\nthe one that doesn't come with the\nintegrated graphic processor which I\ndidn't know but like I I have my\ndedicated discrete GPU anyway. So it was\nlike no problem, right? Until you run\nArch because then when you have some\nNvidia driver issues, you get a lot more\npain because of your your driver.\n>> Sell your Nvidia card at a profit and\nbuy one of those Intel arcs.\nJob done.\n>> Why would I What What is ARC? Is that\nlike a discrete GPU of Intel?\n>> Yeah, I think it's\n>> Why would I go there?\n>> Because their GPUs probably have good\nsupport under Linux, probably.\nBut how am I going to prepare for the AI\napocalypse [laughter]\nif I don't have an Nvidia GPU? I have\nsome life-saving GPU and you're telling\nme to sell it? Guy, you are the worst\ndoom prepper. [laughter]\nGo take your kids to swim.\n>> Okay, guys. If you got this far, please\nlike this podcast and leave a review.\nAnd\nI don't know what else you should do. V.\nDon't doom prep like an idiot.\n[laughter]\n>> Worst advice ever.\n>> Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–7:35]\nHello. Can you hear me? Oh, the video is already on. >> Oh my god. What is that? I didn't even see that. >> It's daylight. It's day. But >> sorry, but can't tell when you're an AI engineer what day of time what day of time it is. All I know is when my credits renew. >> Ah, yeah. Uh, are you are you upgrading the plans yet? >> What do you mean upgrading the plans? >> I I read several people that are like I used to I used to switch between Gemini Cloud Code and other and Codeex and now I'm all in on on cloud code and I'm kind of in the same boat. [snorts] >> Yeah, I'm all in. I'm all in. I mean, that also gets to a point of the I would like to talk about with the with the latest Theo's video. Theo's video. >> I haven't seen that one. This is the Theo's video reaction podcast for all those who are listening. H Oh, I just I just want >> How did you get to cloudbot even? >> Um yeah, I did. I didn't even I set it up. I was maybe going to show you that if you haven't seen it already. I wanted to um ask you. >> Okay. >> Yeah, I just wanted to check in with you. How's your week been? cuz it's been like 2 weeks since we spoke last. And I wanted to add there was another storm in England called Storm Ingrid. And that means that the train line between my station and London has been cut off until they fix it, which is freaking me out. Sounds painful. Yeah, my week. Um, it's actually very exciting because we've got a full green test suite on the rename of the Terafhone CDK. So, we're going to cut a pre-release giving anyone the ability to pull it from the package registries, you know. Um, so I'm setting up the the Maven and Nugat doing settings now. So, that >> what do you need? Maven is a Java build system. You need that for CDK. >> Yeah. Uh CDK for Terraform is published and available in all the gsi languages. And it was actually easier to just rename and get the thing like all of the integration tests are passing Java,Net, Golang, Python. >> Oh, so you support you support like every language under the sun. >> No, the the gsi question uh languages, right? the the ones that are supported by the CDK cloud development kit. Although they if if you look at the ecosystem, most people only or most projects only support uh TypeScript and um Python Python these days. Yeah, some don't even support Golang. I don't understand. I really like Golang, but it's it is a bit slow. When I run the tests, they are very fast on uh on on several uh languages, but they're a bit slower on on…\n\n[slide:2] [7:15–22:26]\n>> that's Chinese, right? >> No. Well, the cool thing about the the thing that there's two things that have sold Claudebot to me is that I can interact with it on WhatsApp. I even have a group between my wife and I and now we can just directly talk so uh talk to to Claude through WhatsApp. We could leave messages. You we could send pictures. So instead of like launching a dedicated app, it's just the familiar WhatsApp interface. So that's that's that's the killer uh use case for using Claude for hosting Claudebot. And then you you link it you link it up to WhatsApp just like any other client and you can just talk to it. Um so that so that's great. And and I guess the other cool thing about uh Claudebot is see it's running on one of my IPs. Um I guess the chron jobs I mean I I don't know how you would do this with claude or or codeex or whatever. Like for example, like you you can set up a a chron job running every so many hours [snorts] >> and then you and then you just prompt it. You say like check this URL for weather warnings and give updates and then also I have another one called announce tomorrow's main event games. >> You have a lot of storms so you need weather updates to the minute now. >> [snorts] >> Yeah, we have a lot of storms, but to be honest, I'm not too sure if this is actually working. We still have we still have another weather warning, run, and maybe I give you a demo on the um on the phone. I have to switch my >> You actually have an external camera. That's pretty cool. >> I use I use my my phone as the external camera. Oh, >> maybe I should do that on my on my Omari setup cuz I have like this USB camera. It's really bad. >> Okay, so let me show you what the experience is. >> Oh, there's one big news also. System initiative. Okay. >> Oh, yeah. I saw it on LinkedIn myself. >> Uh, say hello to Vincent in Vietnam. What's the weather there? What's the [snorts] weather there? So, you basic So, I have it sort of chatting to myself. You see Kai Hendry? It's like configured to chat to me in my own. Why you don't use Telegram? I think Telegram said a bot would be easier than WhatsApp. WhatsApp is painful. >> Yeah. And I have it hooked up to anthropic. So basically this should be an anthropic answer. And I've also hooked up the Brave API. So it should be able to do web searches better. Um and what did it say there? >> Yeah, nice. It's like 48°. Uh not 48. What does it say? It's it's actually quite chilly these days. I don't >> I don't…\n\n[slide:3] [22:05–37:16]\n>> py and you can probably talk about form and pickle, but those guys are absolute hacks, so I'm not going to talk about that. >> Okay, so [laughter] [snorts] okay, hold on. Let me just have a sip of coffee and try to make my point once more that it was extremely slow in Python and that you had a lot of issues. Uh, but to me the problem is Python and that's probably >> Well, I mean maybe you're right, but I want I mean I've worked with with CDK on and off for some years, but it only just occurred to me that type checking uh is absolutely critically important for infrastructure just because it gives you that a really powerful shift left uh error check that everything's kind of going to be okay. You know what I mean? Because like these what I'm trying to say is that a lot of projects that I I I work with with the clients, the type check just doesn't work right. It just doesn't work. It's broken. And and then and then and then of course things break down uh down the road and uh and then you're wondering why that things broke. It's like, well, maybe you should have done some type checking uh earlier sort of thing. So, that that that's that's the point I'm trying to make. And and I guess since you work with TypeScript, you get you get the type check uh feedback immediately, right? >> The the whole experience is pretty sweet. No, but like the whole reason why I use CDK is exactly for the ability to define strong schemas and types around constructs around composable infrastructure. Right? Terraform has a concept of a module to compose your infrastructure. Terraform is by far the largest um or the most adopted today, right? Um and everybody loves the very simple Hashik config language. But in terms of type system it doesn't really do or provide much. In terapform modules you can define a variable. Those are basically your properties or your inputs. Those variables can have complex types but there's no concept of having a type definitions that you can apply to multiple variables for example. >> So if you have something complicated in your modules and and you can then start arguing yeah but you're doing you're using the cloud wrong. If you're doing complicated modules start I'm telling you >> yeah yeah I mean >> inevitable >> yeah so so long >> and exactly what your experiences right I mean infrastructure typing is completely lacking very important but requires a huge amount of upfront work which is not realistic for most organizations >> right you can't expect a…\n\n[slide:4] [36:56–52:07]\nproject though. Handy. >> It's great. Like maybe I could demo it to you right now. Can I demo it to you? I think it works. It just works great. >> I got it running here. So, let's see. Hey, Vincent. And hey listeners to the AI infrastructure podcast. I'm using Handy here to transcribe my speech to text. So the idea is that like instead of me uh typing like a caveman, I can just riff to uh claw code or some other co-pilot text area to to say what I want. But in all honesty, I feel like bigger prompts don't really get you anywhere. I you should just carefully uh enter every word. But nonetheless, I do think it was just a little fun uh idea. So you can see it's like a like super fast. M >> uh let me see if I can >> does it cut out because okay I like this dictation a lot when I use chach on my phone and I will sometimes talk for a long time and then mid-sentence change my mind and maybe duplicate like repeat myself and what I saw is the the text to speech in chatbt it kind of shortens and like >> oh summarizes yeah it fixes everything that's that's >> it fix things up yeah >> yeah so I think it I think I did a few ums and rs but I can't really remember like let let me let me try and make a mistake and then see what it does >> like say something and then go back and say something else is it oh yeah sorry good morning I mean good evening how are you all doing today >> it's definitely going to capture the whole thing >> sorry yeah you're right >> it's more like um >> maybe when when I say the like when I mispronounce something something. >> Yeah, when you like mispronounce something and then say the right thing. >> So, for example, hello Vincent. Hello, Vincent. Sorry, V. No, that's still going to go through anyway. It doesn't matter. >> Okay, I I I got to Okay, let me let me try something. Hello, Vinc Vincent. Oh, no. It did capture everything. >> Yeah, >> I'm curious now how Chip would do that. >> Anyway, it's pretty cool already. It It's pretty cool. But I guess you're right. Once you've got the text there, then then you then the brilliant thing about >> Well, the brilliant thing is that you just have another pass with it in uh with AI to fix it up. >> But >> and I do I I often dictate and then I know that I'm actually went wrong, but then I just keep going and I know that I back. >> That's the That's the only way. I mean, that's that's been the problem for with dictation for decades now. It's like you you can't easily >> cuz you have to like compose your…\n\n[slide:5] [51:46–01:06:57]\nshell and he says the way antropic treats other agent shells is really harmful and and it's really destroying. >> Um so that actually opens the door for openi saying like hey you know we don't do that we we we want you to use codeex in your agent shell because their codeex honestly is pretty bad. I haven't used codeex lately but it was so bad every single time I tried it. Yeah, I gave up. >> But like for me at this point, I just want to >> I'm not even thinking about competition right now. I just want to use I just want to use Claude and build things and get stuff done at this point. Can we just use this opportunity >> a blog? [laughter] I just or you can buy the domain name. I just want to use cloud. And then you you tell people if you're tired of the AI initiatives at your office, just point them to this website. I just want to use cloud.ai AI can pay like $50,000 for the for the domain name. That's like free advertisement for entrop. >> Oh, there's a cl code. I just noticed this. Cloud code anonymous. >> Cool. >> In London. Nice. >> I need to go to that. >> Yeah. So [snorts] I did a few fireside >> I did a few fireside chats with companies and brownbacks and I was like after the parcel performed I felt like oh my god um I really am not in the right company because there's all these other companies are leading in on this but I can tell you that's not true. I just talked to another company and they barely started with um and I guess I don't I won't name them. They barely started with an AI initiative. Um they just you know started to consider it. Um, I gave them a talk because I did a keto workshop as well and there was a couple of things that you talked about with the the misconfiguration of your setup. uh one of them being the MCP overuse and the instructor who is a developer advocate at AWS who was giving the um hero workshop highlighted where MCPs are still relevant which I thought was a pretty nice part of it and he also split the the work that you do um in two parts because VIP coding still has a has a function and he highlighted it that in Kirro when you open Kirro you have the option to go in the full specdriven development flow or to go into a VIP coding session and this is kind of like one of the only well maybe maybe Ko is the first specdriven development and everything else is already vi coding but the fact that they make it so different is it's very nice because he says when you're doing um when you're learning the domain you don't…\n\n[slide:6] [01:06:37–01:14:52]\nwhatever you take from Steve because Steve builds software for Steve [laughter] >> and and and and some people they are more about >> Yeah. I mean the again the the repo looks a bit of a mess. Like look at this target old target new. I mean >> that's probably like a fixture for a migration test. looks like. >> So, this is what I hate about people looking at repositories and saying it's a mess. Like, I I had a repo. >> Oh, we're just talking about hygiene. I mean, this this this doesn't look good, man. >> To me, the hygiene is not what are the different files that are in it. If the AI has the skills and the rules and knows how to iterate or work on it, that is hygiene. I don't think you can eyeball if a repo has good hygiene. >> Come on. You can. We can >> it's h human taste. This is where this is where and actually it was a troll post. >> You need someone with taste to to to drive AI. >> I I got trolled. >> You got trolled. >> So somebody posted on bun subreddit and uh a very instigating post saying so bun has been acquired by entropic and now it turned into AI slop. and he took a screenshot and on the screenshot he put a red arrow pointing at like cloud and pointing at like dot um you know agents and pointing at skills of MD or agents of MD. Yeah, it's AI slop and I was like I was triggered like I was ready to go. I was like [laughter] and then under under the >> AI defender. No, no. It's because I've gotten this feedback and I feel like you don't even know how to use the tools properly and you're just gonna Oh my god, there's a dot cloud must be AI slop, right? Um, so Oh my god, >> I I agree with you. It that's ridiculous. Someone jumping up and down cloud, >> right? And under the screenshot, he put a note sarcasm, by the way. Um obviously Bun has always had very good hygiene in terms of agents directions and rules and therefore um it's been it's been AI managed for a long time and it's still very good right I mean and then in the comments unfortunately most people did not read the last paragraph I can't believe you >> there were some people that were like going like of course it's been acquired by entropic of course it's going to go down the hill blah blah blah yeah those were >> I can't believe AI is trained on Reddit I mean Reddit is such a losers zone.

  "summary": "Conversation between two engineers touching infrastructure tooling, a hosted assistant integrated into messaging, the role of type checking in infra, speech-to-text experiments, spec-driven development and tests, and repo hygiene debates.\n\n[slide:1]\n## CDK fork pre-release and multi-language tests\nThey prepared a pre-release of a renamed CDK fork with a full green test suite and published packages for multiple runtimes; integration tests passed for Java, .NET, Go and Python. Packaging work included updating build settings (Maven/NuGet equivalents) so consumers can pull pre-release artifacts. The hosts note that while the CDK ecosystem exposes bindings to many languages, most adoption concentrates on TypeScript and Python, and non-JS runtimes often run slower because the multi-language kernel launches a Node subprocess as a bridge, adding latency compared with native JS execution. They also discussed how an upstream infra tool moved internal APIs behind an \"internal\" package in a recent major version, which broke previous direct reuse patterns and increased the friction for language bindings.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Hosted assistant on messaging and cron prompts\nOne engineer demoed a hosted assistant they deployed to a small server and integrated with a messaging app so a household group can message the assistant (text, images) without launching a separate app. They run scheduled prompts (cron-style) that ask the assistant to check URLs for weather warnings or announce upcoming events, and link the assistant to a web-search API to improve internet lookups. The deploy ran fine on a low-power single-board computer, and the presenter used a phone as an external camera for demos.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Type checking as a shift-left safety net\nThey argued that strong type checking is \"absolutely critically important for infrastructure\" because it provides fast, local feedback and prevents novel runtime failures; a Python type-checker was used to sanity-check code during a large rename, avoiding expensive synth runs. The discussion contrasts a types-first CDK approach (which leverages TypeScript-style schemas and composable constructs) with the dominant state-based infra tool that exposes weaker schema validation at runtime. The hosts explained that many orgs build private, strongly typed libraries around cloud services to get consistent platform interfaces, and that a network effect is required to make such libraries widely useful; one pragmatic path is automating porting between high-level typed constructs and state-based configs. They also described alternatives to monolithic state locking, where a \"state graph\" or row-level locking over resources can decompose state operations to reduce contention and enable finer-grained applies.\n\n*type checking uh is absolutely critically important for infrastructure*\n\n[slide:4]\n## Dictation, editing, and prompt size trade-offs\nThey tested a speech-to-text tool for dictating prompts and notes, noting it captures literally everything (stutters, mid-sentence corrections) and that an additional AI pass can clean and summarize those transcriptions into usable prompts or prose. The hosts warned that larger prompts and excessive context can worsen AI output quality, so they favor concise, precise inputs over huge context dumps. Practical workflow: dictate → run a cleanup/edit pass with the model → use the cleaned prompt for planning or code generation.\n\n*the bigger the prompts the the more context you have the the worse sort of experience you have with AI.*\n\n[slide:5]\n## Spec-driven flow, VIP coding, and test generation\nThey outlined a two-phase delivery model used by an organization: phase one is human-led specification (requirements, acceptance criteria, steering documents) and phase two lets agents implement tasks once validation rules are in place. A spec-driven tool generates a design, extracts a task list (required vs optional), and can represent dependencies so teams can focus on a minimal viable slice before expanding. The hosts discussed model-selection trade-offs (use a higher-quality model for planning, a cheaper model for code generation to save cost) and described automated test generation: the design phase can produce machine-parsable test descriptions so agents can generate property-based tests or other automated checks from explicit \"always/never\" rules, increasing confidence in generated work.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Repo hygiene, AI-managed repositories, and community reactions\nThey debated what constitutes repo hygiene: one view is human-readable structure and clear tooling; the other is that if an AI agent has the skills, rules and steering docs to iterate reliably, that repository is \"hygienic\" enough. A social-media post mocked a project as \"AI slop\" after an acquisition, which sparked reactions and highlighted how quickly public commentary can misread agent-driven repo artifacts. The episode closes with practical notes: the speaker plans to cut the CDK fork pre-release, attend infrastructure conferences, and keep iterating on integrations, while acknowledging the ongoing trade-offs in tooling updates, environment fragility, and the costs of running models and inference."
