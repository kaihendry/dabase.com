    "content": "Transcript:\nWhy did you move to Vietnam? Just\nbecause you bought a place, I suppose,\njust like I moved to\n>> No, no. I I I came to Vietnam in 2006\nand um I worked 10 years as a\nprofessional services\num consultant implementing ERP systems\nlike financial management system called\ninfor systems. And so that was mostly\nwith international clients. So I was\nbased out of Vietnam but I would be\ntraveling all the time. And my\nbackground is software engineering, but\num I spent 10 years training people on\nhow to enter invoices into an accounting\nsystem without knowing anything about\naccounting initially. Um, so that was\nlike and that's kind of where I learned\nthat you really only understand\nsomething if you\num if you can explain it to someone else\nbut also you get a very different\nperspective from other people cuz they\nput me in front of like manuals of this\naccounting system and they said okay in\none month you're going to the customer\nyou're going to shadow a senior first\nand then later you're going to have to\ndo the trainings on your own.\n>> So you're training like Vietnamese?\n>> No, no, no. International. So I was\nbased out of Vietnam, but um the company\nI worked for had a very big contract\nwith Hilton Hotels Worldwide. So I went\nmostly to Hilton hotels like Gardening\nor\n>> Are you allowed to say these people's\nnames\nor do I have to retract?\n>> No, it's fine. [laughter] I worked 10\nyears um for\npretty much mainly on Hilton and some\nother hospitality clients.\n>> All right. But yeah, I mean it's it's\nnot a secret.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Then how did you get into infrastructure\nthen? How did you become a Kubern I mean\nI think I knew you back in Singapore as\na Kubernetes um zealot,\n>> right?\n>> Made me absolutely made which made me\nwant to push you away because I I I I\njust had bad experience after bad\nexperience with with Kubernetes. I mean\nI use community don't get me wrong and\nwhen it when it's appropriate but uh it\nit does frustrate me.\n>> Yeah. So after about you know 7 years of\ngoing to customers. So from 2006 until\n2013 about um most of the time I would\nyou know we would we would be there to a\nwhole day to install a Windows systems\nyou know we would be having a word\ndocument and we would have our\ninstallation you know with the\nrequirements for the client because\nevery\ncustomer we work with they have\ndifferent requirements. if they are a\nreal estate investment fund in\nLuxembourg, they have different security\nrequirements than the hospitality like\nthe way that they manage the servers,\nthe way that you get access to a server.\nAnd I also worked for Gadak Cement which\nis a whole wholesim subsidiary in\nAzarban and I worked and always had to\nlike follow these manual like\ninstallation steps from a word document\nand I wrote a lot of PowerShell scripts\nto kind of like automate that process,\nyou know. I had a lot of fun with with\nlike um active is it ADO active objects\nfrom Microsoft uh inn net. So so with\nPowerShell you actually have like the\nwhole net. So you could create any\nobject that the Windows system had and I\ncould load like uh access database\nfiles. So some of this software that I\nworked with used access databases. So I\ncould use PowerShell to load the access\ndatabase, read some of the data, modify\nit. So I started making\n>> back now. Gosh, you you must be as old\nas I am.\n>> Yeah. So, so that was a lot of fun like\nbecause we had a lot of bash scripts and\nstuff that other consultants had built.\nUm but yeah, I mean we as we do the same\nthing a lot. So we try to optimize our\nwork, right? So, so we have some\ninternal scripts that we have and um\nthat's part of our professional services\nour our um you know expertise that we\nbring to to to okay supply the system\nright so I I actually spent a lot of\ntime building unattended install scripts\nwith powershell\n>> uh and it wasn't once I saw one customer\nwhich was kadak cementin they had the\nwhole VMware that was back in 201 I\ndon't know 2011 maybe before that VMware\nwas already spread quite in a lot of\nplaces, but\n>> I was working on like preparing a\ntraining session and I had everything\nset up on my virtual machine, but then I\nhad to copy over the settings to the the\nactual client server for um for an a\ntraining session and I said, \"Oh no, um\nI ran out of time and one of the IT\nadministrators says, \"You have you're\nrunning VMware.\nUm what's your IP address? let me clone\nthe VM machine from your laptop and I'll\ncreate four copies for every attendee.\nYeah. And I was like what the hell?\n[laughter]\nSo, so you know after you know spending\nall this time you know creating\nscreenshots so we have a document we we\nwe take screenshots of what we have\nactually done on their machine and then\nyou know hand over to the IT\nadministrator. um you know after doing\nthat flow in many um you know for many\ncustomers I come to this place and\nthey're like let me you know let me\nconnect to your laptop to the VMware\nport and copy the VM. I was like, uh,\nokay, what the hell? At that point, I\nkind of realized that all of this\nWindows manual process is kind of\nnonsense. And I started looking also I\nwanted to run game servers. And I\nlearned I I had like we we bought like a\nPower Edge Dell server that we wanted to\nput in a data center like a colo in in\nVietnam with a friend to run games on\nit. And he needed Windows.\n>> Yeah. I wanted Counter Strike uh you\nCS:GO at the time,\n>> right around 2013. And um at the time he\nneeded Windows for he he ran a big\ngaming uh news website iame.vietnam in\nVietnam and um he needed he wanted to\nhost an up andcoming game but it was\nWindows only. So I ran my my we needed\nto run VMs right Windows and um and\nLinux and so then I also wanted to have\nbetter performance because as soon as\nyou run Counter Strike in the VM you\nstart having performance problems. So I\nstarted to play with like Linux\ncontainers uh and Docker at the time and\nthat's how I got into Docker originally\nand I started going to to uh meetups in\nin Vietnam to learn about like I want to\ningest because I wanted to get create a\ngaming platform for Counterstrike that\nwas like ESL existed, HLTV existed.\nThose are very big like Counterstrike\nrelated related services and I felt that\nthey did not give a lot of like\nstatistics. There was um fragbite sorry\nnot fragbite got frag in America they\ngave oh and esa they had very detailed\nstatistics uh like about your\ncontribution to a round they calculated\nso they could assign skill points to a\nplayer much better than most of the\nother platforms. Yeah. So I was like I\nhad built gaming I had run gaming\ntournaments in in Belgium. So I knew how\nto get all of the logs so you could get\nevery single event from the locks. So\nyou could tell the the Counter-Strike\nserver to send all the locks to you. And\nI was used to like\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I was used basically at the time\nyou used like like IRC bots, you know,\nyou say a certain keyword and that\nmessage was received and the bot would\nwould um identify with a regular\nexpression or whatever or just look if\nthe if the text starts with a certain\nkeyword and then it would execute\ncommands. So people would say things and\nif it had that command then the bot\nwould respond. So, we had like a bot\nthat would read the Counter Strike logs\nand then would keep track of the score\nuh and then keep track of like when it\nneeds to restart or switch the teams so\nthey could, you know, manage a\ntournament. So, I was like, cool, I just\nneed to ingest all of the the statistics\nabout the players. So, I wanted to build\nlike a platform and I I learned Angular\nand NodeJS and Python and try to build\nthis on my own at the same time, you\nknow, as a side project. And I I then\nreally got into Docker and and and go to\nmeetup. So I I got into the Docker\nmeetups and and then\n>> Yeah, that's cool. Like a lot I mean I I\nbasically got into this into this game\nthrough gaming and I think that's a very\ncommon uh\n>> what do you call it? Origin story for a\nlot of people in this business.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Servers to infrastructure engineers.\n>> Yes. And also um going to the meetups\ngave you a lot of like insights um into\nwhat other people were doing and allowed\nyou to talk to people and figure out\nlike even though I was at my day job I\nwas working for 10 years with like these\njust financial accounting systems and\nbuilding you know nets power and\npowershell scripts and and things like\nthat and then now I was like learning\nbash python docker like immutable\nservers and and and So that was like\nreally exciting and interesting you know\num but\n>> but then you then you got into\nKubernetes hard.\n>> Yeah. So one of the meetups that was\naround 2014 after the Google people had\nannounced Kubernetes as a project uh at\nthe Docker Con. Um it looked way\noverkill like initially when I looked at\nwhat they talked about the cublet that\nwas interesting. Yeah. you could run\nthat separately to get like information\nabout your docker demon and the\ncontainers on your host. So that was\nlike yeah maybe I like the cublet but I\ndon't like this everything else right\nand then\n>> the control plane is quite good isn't it\nlike\n>> it was absolutely crazy in the beta. So\nback in 2014 uh I think around September\nthey they went from beta to like sta\nstable v1 um around September. So they\nhad announced it in July and it looked\nreally complicated and at the time I was\nusing digital ocean because I didn't\nknow AWS and I wanted like simple VPS,\nright? A a droplet cost like $5 a month\n>> and it was great for a hobby, right?\n>> Ocean was great, wasn't it? It was so\neasy.\n>> Yeah. And and but they had also um an a\nbounty like if you if you propose an\narticle and they approved it, then they\nwould give you like $30 credit to run.\n>> Oh. and and write the article for them\nand their ex\n>> sorry\n>> that was a brilliant idea to get people\nengaged. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So to to basically create a huge\nknowledge base and to have the community\nbuild a lot of interesting use cases on\ntop of digital ocean and there was an\narticle from a guy who worked at digital\nocean I think about setting up\nKubernetes on digital ocean droplets but\nit was like you originally kubernetes\nwas all bash shell scripts like you had\nto run this script to to build this and\nthat. I mean it was horrible\ninstallation mechanism and then Kelsey\nHigh Tower had written this um guide for\ncore OS. So I was using coros a lot\nwhich is like\n>> yeah o really good\n>> everything is is through systemd unit.\nSo it was all systemd and then they\nbuilt their their fleet\n>> on top of system.\n>> I love the upgrade mechanism where where\n>> yeah so they have dual boot and they had\nlike a locksmith um to basic and was was\nfrom coros right they used to to track\num the whole fleet when one acquired the\nlock to reboot into the second\npartition. They also used the idea of\nchannels. So if you are running on a\ncertain version of chores and you're\nsubscribed to like the stable channel\nand a new version is available, it would\nyou know behind the scenes download the\nsecond uh the new version on a second\npartition and then it would\n>> I think that came\nOS\n>> slight slight little ch tangent before\nChrome OS I had my startup web converger\nwhich had an update mechanism which I\nthought was quite novel I still think\nit's novel and that was based on git. So\nbasically the whole root of the the OS\nis checked into git and then the idea is\nthat it once it's running you do a git\npull and that's how it gets the sort of\nlike deltas and then on reboot it checks\nout the new um updates. Um, so I was\nquite and I'm still am quite uh well uh\nboasting well boasting or promoting my\nmethod over the Chrome OS one because I\nstill think the Chrome OS one is a\nlittle bit overkill but anyway,\n>> right? Um so so the cool thing was I\nreally loved Coros and Kelsey was\nworking at Coros and had this very nice\nguide on how to set up a Kubernetes\nfleet using Coros. Um but he had only\nexamples for AWS and at the time maybe\neven Google Cloud. was before he he\njoined Google and those guides were like\nfirst you have to create your your uh\nyour private key infrastructure your PKI\n>> Kubernetes is the hard way that's how it\nstarts I believe\n>> well it was the hard way before the hard\nway was a thing [laughter] so I I wrote\nthis this guide for for digital ocean\nwhich was massive you know it started by\nyou know bootstrapping your PII with\nselfert like self-signed certificate\nauthority generating different client\nkeys for the SC CD client setting up\nflannel you know and I I did a full deep\ndive into like how does\n>> I've forgotten it sounds\n>> flannel was a core o um pxlan packet\nencapsulation system so it's basically\nto create the overlay network right um\nwhen kubernetes that's one of the great\nthings about kubernetes right every\ncontainer within the fleet must talk to\nmust be able to talk to other containers\nthat may be running on different\nmachines so they create this overlay\nnetwork on top of the underlaying cloud\nnetwork. So you create like maybe three\ncore o droplets and then you create a\nbunch of flannel um demons that keep\ntrack of the range of IP addresses\ncontainers within their host can have\nand then flannel whenever a network\npacket comes in encapsulates it that\nnetwork packet on the overlay network\nencapsulate it in the underlay network\nto then send it to the right node and\nthen that decapsulated and then send it\nokay the source is this container. So,\nso Flannel was a very basic one you\nbacked by CD and then um kind of merged\nwith Calico because Kalico added\nadditional ways of encapsulation that um\nwere less like latency in introduced\nless latency. So, so it was super\ninteresting. I mean all of these tools\ncame out of Coros um and actually this\nwas after somebody within the Docker\nmeetup had asked like hey you know this\nKubernetes thing does somebody want to\nlook at it and I had and and it was\naround the V1 release. So a lot of these\nstuff was um you know getting\nstabilized. Uh so there were less bash\nscripts to download all the all the\nbinaries. You actually had proper Golang\nbinaries that you could download from\nthe releases. And so I was able to to\ntalk about it like watching Brandon\nBurns and Kelsey High Tower talk about\nKubernetes and seeing the live demo of\nKelsey High Tower where he just you know\ntriggers uh a replica set. I think it\nwas later that they introduced\ndeployments. Originally it was um\nreplication\nuh it was not replica set it was like\nreplica controller\num but it was very confusing because the\nname of the object was called like a\nreplication controller where you give it\nthe number of pots you want to run uh\nbut then in real in reality the\ncontroller is something that runs inside\nthe AP inside the control plane that\nthat looks at the request and the actual\nobject is the replica set is how many\nyou want to run of them right so then\nthey renamed it on v 1.1 or 1.2 and they\nintroduced a thing called the deployment\nto basically control the rollover\nmechanism like how do you want to roll\nout between different replica sets. Uh\nso that was all introduced around the\ntime that I went to for Asia in in\nSingapore uh and do a presentation about\nKubernetes there. So I was talking about\nthis amazing, you know, mechanism of\nreplication controllers and then they\nchanged it all to replica sets and I was\nlike I'm very confused about this new\nstuff.\n>> I was a little bit puzzled about replica\nsets myself because because ultimately\n>> it seemed attached to to how you would\nwant to scale your app because because\nif you have too many replicas then you\nyou're going to maybe take too many too\nmany uh CPU or whatever RAM resources.\nAnd I thought\n>> everything it changed so much\n>> like how like if I'm running my app how\nmany replicas do I need? Do I need two\nthree four five 10? Do I do I do it to\nto maximize the resour so\n>> like I I never\n>> when I'm talking about 2014 15 all of\nthat was like very basic. Um today you\nwould obviously use like autoscaling you\nwould um even you have vertical\nautoscaling now you can resize pods\nwithout restarting them. Those are all\nthings that you can do stable because\nlike I just\nit is\n>> because because a few years ago I just\nthought I I just don't trust this\nautoscaler but um but yeah may maybe I'm\n>> so so that that's how I got into it\nright I mean initially I was doing coros\nfor my friend startup um and every time\nthe droplet every time cor updated\nnobody has access anymore because\n[laughter] I was maintaining their SSH\nkeys separately\n>> what was relation ship between core o\nand kubernetes because coros came out of\ndocker didn't it? No what did it\n>> no coros is a was a company um that was\nalso called coros and they had an um\nthey had an operating system called\ncoros which was a container centric\noperating system. So you would run even\nyour debug tools you would run\neverything through contra containers and\nthe actual it was kind of like a\nprecursor to Talos uh today I think\n>> um that idea of like using docker images\nto like I don't know um get your basic\nbash or something well I mean bash is\nnot a good example but like your tooling\nyeah\n>> yeah and and chores originally they they\nhad their own scheduler right um that\nthey built separate from kubernetes\nwhich was fleet and fleet\nThey basically extended the idea of a\nsystemd unit to um to something that you\ncould run across multiple nodes and you\nhad some scheduling constraints on the\nsystemd unit. I forgot the name of it\nthat uh it was a set of units or\nsomething like that. Uh but as\nKubernetes became more popular they\ndeprecated their own fleet and they\nstarted they adopted um Kubernetes and\nthen they built their own flavor of it\ncalled tectonic.\n>> The Kubernetes is system D3. Um, so it\nfeels like systemd went head-to-head\nwith Kubernetes and Kubernetes one,\nright?\n>> M, not really. I mean, systemd was the\nway to run like was replacing your\nupstart and your init systems on the\noperating system, right? And Redhead\nmade it the default and a lot of uh\ndistributions like rejected it, but then\nUbuntu adopted it and then everyone\nfollowed.\n>> Uses a different well c what what's the\nname of the control plan? cublet or\nwhatever to\n>> uh no kubernetes completely decoupled\nfrom it like systemd was purely your\ninit system on your operating on your\n>> how does kubernetes managed the pods and\n>> well that's the container runtime\n>> right\n>> so the container runtime interface so\noriginally a lot of them use docker to\nto use to basically like pull the\ncontainer image set up the file system\nlaunch the process within the cont like\nthe name spaces and the control groups\nset everything up for you, right? Um,\nand then over time there was this uh\nsplit between Docker and Coros because\num Docker was moving fast and breaking\nthings and so Red Hat froze the Docker\nversions and then Coros created a new\nproject called Rocket which is using\nsystemdspawn.\n>> Yeah, systemdspawn. Yes.\n>> And that was like Leonard uh was it name\nLeonard like pit one\n>> butering. Yeah, he he he basically said\nhe came to Singapore as well talked\nabout like systemd and spawn is how I\ndebug. Yeah, systemdspawn is how I debug\num kernels. So I use systemdnspawn all\ntime. It's a very solid product and then\nCororo built rocket on top of it and\nthey added um the good thing about this\ncompetition was that they said like okay\nDocker is using very insecure uh like\nthey didn't have proper verification of\nthe images and and so Koro said we need\nto focus on that and Docker was like\nthat's not our priority our priority is\ndeveloper experience and Coro says okay\nwe're building systemdspawn and we're\nadding this GPG based signing of images\nand and layer like image layer\nverification like basically what\nenterprises need for security and the\nresponse of docker was there well you're\nusing gpg is so old we use tuf like the\nupdate framework and we are using like a\nnotary for signing layers and and they\nthey came up with like a new completely\nnew tool set I think docker at the time\nhad a lot of money as well a lot of VC\ninvestments and so they docker was like\nthis one company and and Solomon hike\nwas like fighting super hard against\nthese giants Google redhead and and\nothers and And um\n>> yeah, they had their own and whatever.\n>> Yeah. So when when they did a Docker con\nthat year that um Cor and Stroet, they\nmade an exposition about like um the the\nwhale at the start of the conference.\nThey did something. I only watched\neverything on Twitter. I I never went to\nany of these events, but I saw on\nTwitter that they had like this this\nopening of the conference and the rocket\nlaunch failed. And hint hint, rocket\nfailed. Like [laughter] they would do\nthese things all the time. Oh man, we\ncan I'm just conscious we this is\nsupposed to be the intro for your grid\num app.\n>> Oh my god. This is going to be a video\nonto itself almost\n>> but like\n>> No, no, no. Yeah, just a background.\n>> Why did core OS fail actually?\n>> It didn't fail. It was acquired by\nRedhead.\n>> Okay. Well, they did I mean it did fail\nin my book because it did seem to go out\nof the view that it seems to have lost\nminds. I think the biggest problem was\nthey had built tectonic which was like a\nterraform based kubernetes flavor. So\nthey had their own um boot system. So\nthey had like this um cloud init\nextension called I forgot ignition. They\nhad this ignition u it's like user data\non steroids uh for pixie booting on on\non networks like your coros and so on.\nIt was amazing like I never ran cor OS\non on LAN but they they were focused on\nlike enterprise customers not\nnecessarily running in the cloud and\nTectonic was all Terraform with like\nignition provider and the problem was\nTectonic was really expensive like the\nlicense to run Tectonic like you could\nrun it for free but you wouldn't get\nsome of the like SSO and other\nenterprise features so originally\nTectonic\n>> was their their commercial offering What\nis the link with Terraform? You you you\nwould use Terraform to provision it or\nsomething or\n>> Yeah. So they they had the like Tectonic\nwas basically a whole bunch of Terraform\npackaged up with Kubernetes bootstrap\nwith ignition with on top of core OS. So\nit would give you a fleet of coros um\nnodes and it would bootstrap CD and the\ncontrol plane for Kubernetes and it\nwould bootstrap every node to join the\ncluster properly and all that. So\ntectonic on top of that it was a bit\nlike open shift right. So, so at the\ntime a lot of these kubernetes\ndistributions came out like open shift\num from ranch like there was wrencher\nand there was also from fedora or susi\nlinux they had also their own flavor and\npretty much everyone was launching their\nkubernetes flavor\n>> um and before the clouds launched them\nlike Google had\n>> I think had nothing\n>> yeah I did not like it\n>> it was I mean it's the same thing with\nlike I I So my background's always been\nvery operational.\n>> Sorry,\n>> it was the most minimal one. I think\nthat's why I was attracted to\n>> it was the most like easy one like\ndocker compos like the reason developers\nlike to run docker compose is because\nit's easy almost no dials and knobs same\nlike wrencher you would just run it it\nwould just run it would spin up\neverything and it would just run and I\nhated that because I I was deep into\nlike spinning up my CD my own\ncertificates my own you know user data\nat that time. So, so, so the thing is I,\nyou know, you start digging in really\ndeep and then as you are, you know, I\nwasn't working at a company that was\nlike having real needs. I I wasn't\nworking at any company using Kubernetes,\nright? So, for I was doing this all for\nfun. So, all of this stuff that took\naway my fun like rancher that was no\ngood. I wanted to do it myself. So I\nremember very early somebody asked like\nI was talking about running a mail\nserver on the on on on digital ocean\nlotion and somebody said why wouldn't\nyou just use AWS and I was like oh you\nknow why would I pay all of this extra\nmoney [laughter] I can do it myself and\nthen of course you you get called\n>> Yeah. No and then you get called in\nthese problems um because my friend\nstartup he's trying to send emails and\nthen they go into like the they go into\n>> Yeah. they go in quarantine and then\nhe's like, \"Oh, Vincent, what is this?\nLike our our spam house uh reputation is\nbad and and then it's because you're\nusing digital ocean IPs and they are\nobviously like blacklisted in spam house\nand so then you start to get all of\nthese issues and also you know once I\ngot all of the Kubernetes figured out\nand I could [clears throat] do cluster\nupgrades easily and all of that and then\nyou don't want to bother with it anymore\nafter a while like that's done. you've\nyou've played enough with it and now you\nwant to just focus on deploying things\non top of it. So it took a while to get\nto that stage and also when you're in a\ncompany and you have to deliver a\nbusiness value and not just spin up\nclusters\n>> then you start to say actually you know\nI can use\n>> in your current role are you still a\nKubernetes u uh monkey or whatever the\nterm is for\n>> uh so my last role that I use Kubernetes\nwas like two years ago.\n>> Okay. So now you've like gone\nterraformish. Well, you got CDK or\n>> Yeah. Um\nI I really was interested about CDK. I\njust never had the opportunity to play\nwith it, right?\n>> Um so so I got into\n>> an organization that used CDK and then\num I saw the benefits of it and and then\nalso I worked with I worked plenty of\ntimes that I trained people how to use\nKubernetes. And when you use something\nlike ECS and you have something like CDK\nthat can create container definitions or\nFargate backed uh you know just define\nmy workload it's so much easier to to\nwork with than if you have to like you\nknow define everything with Argo CD and\nGitHubs and and endless lines of YAML\nand and so again it's one of those\nthings that's very interesting for a\nwhile and then once you've done it you\nget really bored of it [laughter]\nyou know initially.\n>> Well I mean yeah like I think I\nempathize with you. I I we we we're all\nexposed to these these technologies. Um\nand and we as you should and like Yeah.\nI know about Kubernetes, I know about\nTerraform, I know about CDK. The more we\nknow the better we are really. It's not\nlike I do find it weird when\n>> the more we understand the trade-offs as\nwell.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because that's a problem. Like we don't\nreally know the trade-offs. If we only\nknow one tool, we think this is the best\ntool ever until we start using other\n>> tools. When people try to sell\nthemselves as as a Kubernetes\ninfrastructure engineer, like why don't\nyou learn learn other things, a dude?\n>> But the good thing is though, like I use\nFargate a lot at work now. And there's\nseveral cases where we're like, oh, we\nneed to do this thing or that thing. And\nI'm like, well, that that would just be\nan ingress manifest on Kubernetes and\nthat would just be like something like a\nservice mesh or like an\n>> trade-offs, the comparisons. That's very\n>> you very quickly like find the\nlimitations where you're like well in\nKubernetes I would have I would control\nmy my service mesh or my uh overlay\nnetwork. Uh for example one issue that\nwe had is we wanted to save cost and use\nlike memory swappiness and like be able\nto because we have very bury workloads\nof different um services. So one service\nwe don't need very big machines but when\nthey do need the resources when certain\nrequest comes in they they need to be\nable to to to take up a lot of memory\nand CPU and not necessarily fight each\nother. So the idea was to basically\novers subscribe nodes. Uh which you can\ndo easily with Kubernetes, right? You\ncan you can have only two nodes and and\ngive them give your pods a lot of memory\neven though you don't have the memory\navailable. Um Kubernetes will be able to\nrun them and you can't do that with\nFargate obviously because Fargate you\nhave to give it exactly what you want\nand it's going to run exactly that. You\ncan't really burst. Um so so then we\nneeded to run our own ECS nodes and um\nthat was before AWS announced managed\nnodes by the way that they also just\nannounced like a month ago. Um but\nanyway\n>> wait a minute AWS has had managed ECS\nfor a while. I mean Fargate is managed.\nWhat do you mean?\n>> No no managed managed autoscaling groups\nlike um you didn't have that until like\na month ago.\n>> Okay, I'll take it away.\n[laughter] Okay.\n>> Yeah, they they just announced it like\nyou could spin up right your capacity\nproviders in ECS can be either Fargate\ncapacity provider where they take care\nof everything and you just say the\ndimensions of what you want and they\nwill just you know make it available but\nyou can't oversubscribe really much.\n>> Okay. I see. Okay. So we I think we need\nto to to to what do you call it uh\nconnect to your your grid project. So,\nhow would you introduce your grid\nproject? So, that makes the next video\nkind of\n>> makes sense.\n>> Um,\nhow do I\n>> Well, let me let me see if I can jog\nyour memory. Like, I think you\nintroduced grid to me because you said\nthat, you know, the the whole open tacos\nthings was interesting, but it it didn't\nsupport strongly typed\n>> right\n>> stacks. So the grid API is sort of\ndemonstrating that you can you can\nproperly track your your infrastructure\nstate\nuh yeah in a compelling way using yeah\nthe the strongly typed CDK stacks.\n>> Yes. So, so a lot of these projects that\nwere introduced like from Terram team\nwhich is the state graph and from digger\nwhich is the open tackle um they're just\nfocused on classic terapform which\ndoesn't expose a lot of the type system\nof the resources right so\nstate graph does promise that every\nresource has a type so it should be able\nto give you more information it get it\nit gets rid of all of the states. So\ninstead of having like many many small\nstates, you have one big state graph.\nEvery resource is in there. Every\nresource has like attributes that are\nstrongly typed. So you don't need to go\nthrough the state as a boundary or as an\nencapsulation mechanism. Um because\neverything lives next to each other,\nright? Um with with Digger they are\nstill allowing you to create multiple\nstates and you are able to define the\ndependencies between the states and\nyou're able to define arbback on top of\nthat and now they're integrating with\nwork OS for like you know your\ndeployment mechanisms. I haven't looked\nat open taco recently. Um but the both\nof them I mean I I I kind of like the\nopen taco approach because I still\nbelieve that you want to encapsulate\na little bit like the the the for\nexample the platform team may want to\nencapsulate the landing zone that they\nprovide right um what we as a service\nprovide to other teams we maybe only\nwant to expose the subnet ids and the\nVPC ID and we don't want to like have\nall of the VPC information network\ngateways everything uh All these\nresources don't mean much for other\nteams. We just say this is the landing\nzone and we have a couple of outputs for\nyou, a network ID and a subnet ID and\nyou can launch in there. Right? So to me\na terapform state as an encapsulation\nmechanism still makes sense. I don't\nknow how state graph is going to solve\nthat problem. Um and I talked to them\nand they were like we want type\ninformation just like you. Um but\nthey're building it there on their own.\nThey're doing it in Okamel and I haven't\nbeen really been like able to\ncommunicate with them much\n>> in Okamel. Oh man.\n>> Yeah. So, so then open taco they're\nbuilding this in Golang which is much\nmore approachable in in a DevOps\necosystem because you know Terraform\nKubernetes everything is Golang. So,\nGolang tooling uh is is available and I\ntry to talk to them but they don't\nreally respond at all and also because\nof the reaction of the community towards\nopen taco it feels a little bit like\npersona non grata. So, um I feel like I\nwant something similar that allows me to\nexpose the deeply typed information that\nI have from my library. So I have a\nlibrary that gives you these higher\nlevel constructs. We talked about it. We\nshowed like this the way that you can\nvisualize it. You can define like hey by\nthe way my constructs imple can be\ndisplayed on on a diagram and this is\nhow it displays itself. So you can add\nthese interfaces on top of it. Right.\n>> That demo that we recorded just for\npeople's context was recorded like two\nweeks ago.\n>> You said that you were going to you were\ngoing to specitate the uh the or\n>> authentication. Yeah. I think I said\n[clears throat] in the video back then\nthat I don't think it's going to be\npainful.\n>> It's going to be painful. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. So, so the Was I right, Vincent?\nFor once.\n>> Yes, you were right, Kai. [laughter]\nYou want\nOkay. So, so the speckit experiment was\ntwo, three weeks. I think by the time\nthat we recorded demo, I had spent two\nweeks on it and I had it had raced\nthrough all of my questions and it had\nbuilt a monor repo with Golang. It had\nbuilt a CLI and SDK. has built a UI,\nhooked everything up and you was and\nthat will be shown in the demo. Uh the\none thing missing for me to deploy this\ninto my organization is to have a strong\nauthentication and because you know you\nwant to be able to integrate with SSO uh\nand things like that. So I thought you\nknow I'm just going to ask packet to do\nthat. And I think my biggest mistake was\nto to assume that this could all be done\nin like one feature.\n>> Uh I didn't break it down. I said like\nthis is authentication, authorization\nand um you know no web login and\neverything\n>> SL\nno SL just OIDC uh and and so specit did\na great job three days planning it um\nlike I said I spent 70% time planning\nand then 40% time implementing for some\nother features so I was like I was very\nconfident I was done with the planning\nphase um however it kind of\n>> when when you say planning phase were\nyou using like the plan mode of claude\nor would you use plan mode of spot?\n>> Yes, because the plan mode of cloud\nworks within a context window, right?\nAnd then as soon as a context window is\ndone, maybe you can carry over like with\na compact, you can carry over some to-do\nitems, but it's very limited and a lot\nof context gets lost. So the spec kits\nplanning phase is really focused on\ncapturing all of the functional\nrequirements and like gap analysis and\nedge cases and writing that down into\nmarkdown.\n>> Did you ever play with beads in the end,\nSteve?\nDid you find Yay or nay?\n>> What's your So, so full honesty, I been\nplaying with it only today and so far um\nit does some interesting things. I think\nBeats prompts the agent to spend a\nlittle extra time to to do its own\nplanning phase on each individual issue.\nSo my my biggest problem with speckit as\ndoing this oidc which supposedly I said\nwas going to take me three days and it's\nbeen almost four weeks. Um, my biggest\nissue is that the resulting task lists\nbecame a 2,000line markdown file and\neven you know even when I start on one\nphase maybe six tasks within that\nmassive list of like 80 tasks um it kind\nof like blows the context pretty fast\nlike hey uh cloud we're going to we've\ngot this beautiful plan and research and\neverything.\n>> How do you track the context? is like I\nthink in Claude you have to go\nslashcontext every time and that's\nannoying as hell.\n>> Yeah. So I there's this status bar thing\nnow that you can do but I've got only my\n>> I don't think you can\n>> but there's quite a few people that\nwrite tools that run like demons in the\nbackground that that monitor the context\nand so you could run those demons and\nthen display it in the status bar.\n>> How do you track it then? No,\n>> I I do context. [laughter]\nI haven't installed those state I I just\nI just initiated the status bar in my\ncloud right now. So I I do have like my\noriginal bash prompt. Um and I seen\npeople talk on Reddit about hey here's a\ndemon that shows you your tracks your\nusage. You run the demon and then your\nyour bash prompt can show\n>> how everyone wants this but uh they they\nhaven't delivered on this status bar\nshown.\n>> But they they have delivered on other\ncool stuff but you're really derailing\nme. But they have delivered for example\non on the ability to like you can\ntrigger a plan mode get a plan and then\nyou can control G edit it control J J\nthe the G how [clears throat] you say G\n>> okay\n>> gangster um\n>> yeah golf\n>> so you can you can edit the plan now\nbefore when the plan wasn't right you\nhad to you put in a prompt and say no no\nno you're missing this and then it would\ndo another plan and then it would miss\nsomething else\n>> okay so going back to beads your\nthousand line markdown or whatever you\n>> so so this a problem right uh I've got\nthis massive task list from the speckit\nuh research phase and planning phase so\nnot the cloud mode like not the cloud\ncode planning but the specit planning\nwhich is multiple steps a big workflow\ngenerates a lot of research and creates\nvery detailed tasks of like multiple\nphases it became huge because my feature\nwas too big and I should have probably\ncut it down but what I'm hoping now um\nis with beats it actually parses out the\ntasks and tracks them not in a markdown\nfile but in like a database like an SQL\nlight right and it synchronize the\ndatabase file to a JSON format like JSON\nL so you can you know committ it to your\ngit so you can see the diffs yeah and\nthey can even handle the merges of\ncompleted task better supposedly but I\nhaven't done that yet so so with beats\nnow I had a actually just had a very\nnice experience which was it had\ncompleted three tasks and it hadn't\nblocked so beats speeds ads workflow and\nit had unblocked the next task and then\nI was not using son I was using haiku\nand haiku\nlooked at the issue that it needed to\nwork on the task that it needed to work\non and it went into this like planning\nmode which I think is something that\nbeats introduced because I've never seen\ncloud do that until I activated beats\nand after it went into the planning mode\nit came up with its plan and it was\ndifferent from I mean it something\nwasn't right I there was some mistakes\nin there I was like that's not right And\nso the cool thing is I didn't have to\nopen my markdown file and then scroll\ndown to this like phase number eight\nwhich is at line 800 and then find\nexactly what was the original task that\nit was supposed to work on. I could just\nrun beat show that issue originally that\nyou started with and I saw immediately\nlike hey there's a mistake here. Uh and\nso it it really allowed me to slice and\ndice directly to the particular task. So\ninstead of having like uh this massive\nmarkdowns that you have to also blow up\nyour context with you can now like very\ndirectly ask questions about partic\nparticular issues and look at them and\nfind the links between them. So because\nit creates a graph of issues right so so\nfar\n>> of the the links have you like linked\nthem up like showing which ones depend\non another or does it do it\nautomatically?\n>> It did it automatically. So I I asked uh\nyeah I\nI have recorded the loom about this\nprocess. Um but it's a bit messy. Uh\nbasically what happened is\nI was going back and forth between cloud\nand Gemini. Gemini is not good at\nwriting code but it's great at reading\ncode and giving like a review of another\nperson of another plan. Codex can do the\nsame thing but Gemini does it much\nfaster. So what happened is cloud came\nup with this plan. we're going to do\nABC. And then I went to Gemini. I said,\n\"Mate, does that make sense? Like, can\nyou go look if that already exists?\" And\nGemini says, \"No, none of these things\nexist. That is but that is\ncorrect.\" So then I went back to cloud\nand I came up with like a 300line\num prompt and and then I push push it\ninto um a new cloud instance with Beats\nactivated because you have to like\ninstall the MCP, you have to initialize\nyour agent, you have to make sure that\nit knows that it needs to use Beats. And\nthen I gave it this 300 line prompt that\nI fine-tuned with Gemini and it went\nahead and created okay Gemini made it\nvery clear we need to do this this this\nthen this and then cloud used beats\ncreated all the issues linked them\ntogether what what depended on what uh\nwhat unblocks what and then created a a\nbeautiful graph and it started with the\nne the first two issues that were\navailable.\n>> Show a graph.\n>> Um\n>> you're right. Uh I haven't I haven't\nlooked at the I haven't seen a graph,\nbut I've seen the the full JSON output\nand I've seen the full list and I've\nbeen able to look at the issues uh very\nquickly. So I haven't uh tried the graph\nyet but so far like I said I think beads\nadds through its MCP tools some\ninstructions to like prompt cloud when\nit picks up an issue to do some\nadditional research and and the issue\nitself that was created by cloud within\nbeats actually has a lot of context. It\ncaptured all of the requirements,\nacceptance criteria and things like\nthat, which is I was surprised because I\nthought, you know, when you have a to-do\nlist in in cloud, it's just like one\nline. I need to do this one thing. I\ndon't know how cloud tracks more\ninformation than that just one line. But\nin Beats, I can see it. Like there's a\ntitle and there's a description. It says\nlike this is what we need to do. This is\nwhy we need to do it. These are the\nfiles we need to change. And this is the\nacceptance criteria. Was like, oh,\nthat's pretty cool. I'm not sure. I'm\nnot a thousand% sure it's the MCP\nbecause I noticed when I hit this MCP\nbug last week that that uh Claude, for\nexample, was just invoking the BD CLI\nright on my my sh.\n>> Yeah, I I had to bootstrap um the agent\nto make sure that it has like you need\nto use the tools, not not the CLI\n>> BD quick start or whatever inside your\nagents MD or whatever.\n>> Yeah, I did. I did. I did the BD on\nboarding. Um, and so yeah, but I also\nwanted to originally like why do I need\nan MCP? Like I hate MCPS because\n>> Yeah, I don't that's what I was going to\nsay next. I don't think you need an MCP,\nbut uh just because\n>> it was broken and it seemed to still\nwork.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And um I also\ninstalled the agent skill. So be beats\nalso has like this new thing from cloud\ncalled uh a like skills.\n>> All right. I think I think on the web\npage you can it's called a plugin. Is\nthat the same thing? No,\n>> I'm not sure. So I didn't want to\ninstall the plugin. I I didn't know what\nit was going to do. So I actually went\nthrough everything that the plugin does\nmyself. Like I installed the the the\nCLI. I think we you have to do anyway.\nYou have to install the CLI and then I\nused UV to install the tool which is the\nMCP. So I can run the MCP directly. I\ndid not install it as a as a as a as a\nplug-in. And then I had to do the the\nthe gith hooks, but that's part of your\nBD init. So when you init in a\nrepository, it will create your git\nhooks. Then it had something like do you\nwant to go multi-reo? And I think that's\none of the cool features is that it can\ndo multi-reo. But mine is a very big\nmonor repo, so I don't want to do that.\nSo I was like, it gave me a warning.\n>> I didn't know that.\n>> Yeah, there's a demon.\n>> Yeah,\n>> that's this is really good. Okay. I\nmean, I think we have to cut it here\nbecause I I\n>> think we need to do a separate session\non beat. Yeah,\n>> I don't know if you have enough for\nintro. Uh, but yeah,\n>> we got plenty for intro. I mean, I'm\nhoping just to cut this. I also need to\ngo and uh yeah, and I'll time stamp it\nso people could skip it if they wanted\nto. Okay,\n>> by the end of this week, I want to um\ntry beads with speckit. So now I'm\nlearning it like on my current task like\nbut then the next step is I want speckit\nnot to create this 20,000 line markdown.\nI want speckit to use beats. I haven't\ndone that yet. Um, so I'm using I'm\nlearning it first. Yeah,\n>> sounds awesome. Okay, we'll keep in\ntouch. See you.\n>> Bye. Okay, see you. Have a nice day.\nReally really enjoy this. I think we\ncovered a lot of things. I think\n>> maybe.\nOkay, one more thing.\n>> Um, so so basically we talked about open\ntaco and all of these state management\nsolutions also. Now we just talked about\nthe integration patterns, right? We\nmentioned that you can you can use a\nvariable file on disk or a big config\nfile that keeps track of all of the\ndifferent like a dictionary of all of\nthe different integration keys. Right?\nSo at my organization we we started\noriginally trying to use an integration\nregistry. Then we move towards like the\nteams only publish dev from their\nproduct repo and when they want to go to\nstaging and need to integrate there they\npublish their infrastructure as a\npackage and then we consume it and\nintegrate it within our monor repo. So\nwe have a big terapform monor repo. A\nlot of organizations have a big\nterapform monor repo because you have\nthose file system requirements to read\ndata, right? Um because we couldn't use\nthe integration registry. So instead\nthey publish their artifact, they\nversion it and then we integrate it. The\nsame for production. Um but I still want\nto have the ability to go across\nrepositories and integrate without um\nyou know having to publish things. So\nthat's why I started to build this thing\ncalled the grid which is around Terra\nconstructs. So Terra constructs has\nalready the capability of strongly\ntyping your outputs. So if you need to\nintegrate on things, you know exactly\nwhat the shape will look like of what\nyou depend on. For example, if we have a\ncluster, we we may have a VPC ID output.\nWe have subnets which is an array of\nstrings. We may have more more\ncomplicated integration points, right?\nUm but let me just let me just run the\nAPI real quick. API surf\nuh not server surf\nbinary.\n>> Let's put it on the path. So now this\nthe the grid API is running and I will\ngo into the web app and run the the the\ndashboard. It's a very basic dashboard.\n>> Everything's a bit slow right now. I\ndon't know why. Okay. Maybe it's because\nI have 100 different things open.\n>> Yes, it's V hot moderator load. Vue.js,\nright?\n>> Uh no, this is React. [laughter] I don't\nknow anything about front end. Um so so\nthis was all written using specit using\nuh specdriven development.\n>> Holy moly.\n>> And yeah and and some of the UI elements\noriginally bootstrapped by bolt. Uh but\nthen yeah so so this is basically the\ngrid when you are creating for example\nthe network which has a bunch of in this\ncase there are zero outputs because I\nhaven't really applied anything. Um but\nthen you have dependencies that define\nfor example the staging cluster depends\non the subnet ids from the network and\non the VPC ID from the network also the\nstaging database depends on the VPC ID\nto provision into the network\n>> right so we have these dependency\ntrackers and this is really the idea was\nmainly from open taco right\n>> why why are there two arrows going into\nthe cluster am I going\n>> because multiple every output is tracked\nindividually\n>> okay\n>> okay I I can do a demo where I actually\napply things with Terraform so you can\nsee the colors change when things and\nthen you know why there's multiple\nerrors. This this is a a preset database\nwith some filtering. So I can\n>> you know we we we need to do like a\nvisual\nI think the theme for the next chat is a\nvisual infrastructure because I did want\nto talk about uh Adam Jacobs uh oh my\ngod\nwhat is this startup called? Help me\nGod.\n>> Uh system initiative.\n>> Yeah\n>> I right\n>> because I'm think I'm thinking system\ninitiative when I'm looking at this.\nI'm not building uh what he call a\ndynamic graph where every node has like\ndifferent their own um hooks on create,\nread, update, delete. So it's a\nprogrammable graph. That's what system.\n>> Okay. Okay. So yours is more of like a\nlike a visualization type of\n>> mine is a terraform state on um manager\nand the idea is to integrate tightly\nwith terra constructs so that all of\nthese um all of these\npoints here are actually strongly typed.\nSo if I if I'm\nyou can see your level twos and things\nlike that in here.\n>> Yeah, but I'm I'm using modules as an\nencapsulation. So whatever the product\nteam they can be writing terapform\nmodules in here. Uh sorry I'm not using\nmodules in encapsulation. I'm using\nstates as an encapsulation. So the so in\nmy case the platform team is using the\nAWS VPC module to provision the the\nnetwork and all.\n>> Okay. Okay. State state state. Got it.\n>> Yeah. And if they want to expose the VPC\nand the subnet ids they should be able\nto expose them as with the schema. So if\nthey're doing it using terra construct\nthe schema is attached to the L2s. So if\nyou you know you say to the L2 push your\noutputs out to your state so you know\nyou make it available as a as a contract\nto other teams then other teams when\nthey use Terra constructs they will read\nthat output and they get the schema with\nit. So they know that this this output\nhas this shape because this is one of\nthe problems that I have when I was\nusing the integration registry, right? I\nwhat are the parts that write things and\nhow do I find the keys that I need and\nwhat is the shape of those keys? How do\nI write them down? How do I read them\nback out so that I get a strongly\nversioned um feedback\n>> contracts and stuff? Yeah.\n>> Right. So let me let me uh do a database\nreset\nhere. Um go back make DB reset.\nIt's going to delete the Postgress\nvolume and restart it.\n>> Okay. Oh,\n>> by the way, um why didn't you use SQL\nlight? You just\n>> It's I'm using an ORM. Uh and it's using\nthe PG dialect if I want to use SQL. I'm\nactually adding SQL light as a next\nstep.\n>> Um\n>> that's that's one that's the next\nfeature that speckit's going to be\nworking. Unsurprisingly, Claude is an\nabsolute demon with uh with SQL Light\nbecause SQL Light has like no proper\ngolem times and types and stuff, right?\n>> Um I don't really know. Couldn't\n>> When you say demon, do you mean the\nbeast like really good at it or the\ndemon like chaotic?\n>> No. No. I'm It's really good at it. Like\nit able\n>> I thought demon like like it's a devil.\n>> No, I love it. it like it it was able to\ncreate these like materialized views and\nother optimizations to to make quite\ncomplex views really simple to generate.\nI mean it's so incredible really.\nSo I I will restart the grid API server\nand I will restart the web app.\nOkay. And now if I refresh there's\nnothing in there, right? So now if I go\nto the\n>> by the way you can you can bootstrap\ntasks in VS code if you have instead of\nlike\nthere. Yeah\n>> it's it's just search VS code tasks\nyou'll find out how to do it.\n>> Okay I'll need to do that. So I go into\nthe example Terraform. So here I have a\nsome setup and I should clear but I will\njust create a network and um okay so I\ngo into the network I\nI remove anything that's there. So right\nnow there's just the terraform\nconfiguration which is\n>> just um a null resource. It's not really\nanything. It's not using AWS but it\nsimulates a VPC output with the ID of\nthe null resource and a subnet ID. It's\nnot the list. It's just an example.\n>> Go to the top of the file. Why did you\nOkay, so you just specify the provider.\nOh, actually\n>> it's a single file. Okay.\n>> Yeah, it's all it's all it's it's really\njust a sample Terraform configuration\nand I will use the grid uh control. So\nthis command line currently is just a\nsample CLI implementation. For my\npersonal use, I'm going to use it to\nintegrate within our bootstrapping\nbecause we have like a a Golang CLI to\nbootstrap Terraform and so I'm going to\nuse it to automatically integrate with\nthe API. So the the CLI is just one\nsample implementation that I include\nwith the monor repo but I have my own\nthat I I need to integrate it into. So\nI'm using state create to create a new\nstate and I have to give it a logic ID.\nSo this is one of the first things in\nterapform or in infrastructure a lot of\ntimes names change. So maybe this could\nbe like the uh product a network or\nsomething like that. But over time we\nrealize that actually product a network\nshould be shared and it should now\nbecome shared network. So the logic ID\nis decoupled under the hood. generates a\nunique identity separately. The CLI uses\nUID v7 but this is again the database\naccepts whatever the client wants to use\n>> that's actually uh a really good idea\nbecause the minute we have to change our\nTF state uh\n>> it becomes a nightmare more so if you\nuse back end key uh I'm I'm always just\nyeah I hate that\n>> you need to do migrations then you need\nto keep tracking where the other states\nwere that you depend on\n>> yeah so I like this idea but I mean\nyou're only just using it to just keep\ntrack of it you're not using it to help\nmanage\nuh\nwhat uh the logic ID yeah the logic ID\nis is is a is a mutable attribute of the\nstate but it can be uh but it is\nglobally constrained as unique so across\nthe postress there's I mean\n>> I I like the idea but like you're not\nusing it to actually store the state\nyou're just using it to keep track of it\nof course\n>> yeah uh yeah we're just we're just using\nit to keep track of it as a unique\nidentifier\n>> yeah it's a good idea\nso at This point I have created by the\nway I have not run terraform apply yet\nbut if I refresh and I will make this\nlike polling uh with like web workers\nwhatever but right now I just forced it\nto be to this is one thing when you do\nspecd driven development it's really\nimportant to scope things down and at\nthis point I thought like this might be\ntoo complicated so I put it very\nexplicit put\n>> I mean to be honest I'm I'm gang refresh\nI don't like to uh to wait for things to\nhappen\n>> automatically so now terapform init and\napply\nwill then\nregister the subnet ID and the VPC ID as\noutputs in in the grid. Right? So this\nthis is running Terapform, right? I'm\nnot running anything else. This is\nliterally just Terraform talking to the\ngrid API and then grid API is extracting\nthe outputs and keeping track of them\nokay separately. So if I do grid ctl\nlist\n>> uh state list,\n>> I can see it. I can also um I can see\nit's clean because it's just been\napplied. So if I go to my uh cluster\nwhich needs to depend on the network,\nlet me remove every terapform file or\ngrid uh file that should be in there. So\nit's only the no resources again that\nare in here, right? And in this case the\ncluster needs to read the network VPC\nID, right? It it depends on that. So I\ncan say grid ctl state create cluster u\nlogic ID, right? And then grit ctl u\ndeps add from network and it will bind\nthe outputs of the network and this is\nwhere the type will be important right\nbut right now this is a non Terra\nconstruct demo this is pure terapform no\ntyping yet right\n>> so in this case I'm the the two the the\nselection is a bit weird you need to\npress enter I'm going to change that but\nanyway um it was a default\n>> generated by AI I can tell\n>> yeah [laughter] I think it's a pterm\ndefault so right now the network and the\ncluster has a dependency and now you see\nwhy these errors are separated because\nyou have two different outputs and they\nmay evolve separately. So the cluster\ndepends on the network.\n>> Sorry, the yeah the cluster depends on\nthe network. If I do grid ctl state\nlist, I can see that the clust the the\ncluster is stale because it has not been\napplied. It has not been observed by the\ngrid API, right?\n>> The grid ctl state in it again generates\nthe\n>> the backend config for me.\n>> But now comes the interesting part. I\ncan use grid ctl or whatever however I\nintegrate the SDK into my command line\nor my Golang tooling to to in or to sync\nthe depths. So to sync the depths means\nit's going to generate the remote state\nlookup for the network using that unique\nidentity and then pre-generating the\nnetwork locals for me. So I know that\nthere's a subnet ID. Again, this is\nbecause I declare that this state needs\nthose two outputs. So it's going to\ngenerate\n>> you're using the data is using the grid\nbackend to grab the to make the link.\nOkay. You so you're not relying on the\nfile system.\n>> So I have yeah no no file system. So I\ncan go across repositories right. So\nthis is an API server which is our think\nyou can pretty much do this with space\nlift. You can do this with Terraform\ncloud for sure.\n>> This is something I think would be\nincredibly fun to deploy in my\nworkplace. So I mean do you have a\nstandalone binary which I can start\nrunning and linking up uh different uh\nstate files and and drawing a graph? I\nthink that has a lot of value actually.\nIt has a lot of value. This is going to\nbe Apache to open source. I want to open\nsource this once I've got the type\nschema integration with Terra construct.\nI it's right now it's in GitHub private\nrepo. I can give you access. Um I'm not\nsure about open sourcing it because it's\nvery I mean at this point it's similar\nto open taco. I have to be honest. I I I\ntalked to the Open Taco people. I\nunderstood how they use it.\n>> It's not Open Taco, it's the [laughter]\ngrid. Um they're they're doing great\nwork with Open Taco by the way. I look\non the pull requests, they are adding a\nlot of features. They added SQL light\nalready and and they they're using\nLightream. I I think that's what\n>> So they they bas So so there's a lot of\noverlap what you're doing in open\ntyping.\n>> There's a lot of overlap except I want\ntype schemas and they're not talking to\nme. [laughter]\nSo, I'm like, like I said, I told them\nthat I could oneshot this in cloud, so I\ntook 10 days to oneshot this in cloud.\n[laughter]\n>> Oh, man. I'm loving the innovation here.\nI'm loving it. Um, yeah, I mean, I I I\ndefinitely would love to to to have this\nvisualization on on some state files.\nUm, but I don't I'm just playing I'm\njust playing devil's advocate here,\nVince. I just I I I see myself\n>> u enjoying like a visualization\n>> but not the type schema.\n>> But uh but even the type schema that\ncould help me uh to do some bugs or\nsomething like that. Um, I mean that's\nthe way that's the way I see typing is\nlike helping me figure out where there's\nissues\n>> uh like I I would see it as a\nvisualization but like but that's that's\na hard that's a hard sell as a as a\nproduct like you know like it's\n>> I'm not selling it like I'm I'm so my\nmain goal here is um to basically make\nsomething available that I can use\nmyself. Also the way I designed it, I I\nmake the package the SDK is a strongly\ntype Golang and because I'm using\nconnect RPC, I also created TypeScript\npackage because that's what I use in my\ndashboard in my web app. So in my web\napp, I'm actually using the um the grit\num where is it the grid? Where is the\ngrid tacons? Here I'm using the TCON. Um\nI'm autogenerating the clients in\nTypescript and in Golang. Uh it could be\nJava, whatever because it's using\nconnect RPC. Uh al although I do need to\nwrap it because connect RPC handlers are\npretty horrible. And anyway, what I want\nis to basically use this one in my\nlibrary to\n>> interact grid. It's some third party.\nWhat is that?\n>> No, that's my workspace. So that's my TS\nSDK, right? It's autogenerated from from\nthe protobuff definitions and then a\nlittle\n>> tons\nconstructs. Oh,\n>> it's all my project, baby. [laughter]\n>> Okay. Okay. I'm a little bit slow. No,\nbut it looks I I definitely see the\nvalue in that. I really would like to\ntry that out, actually.\n>> Yeah. So, how it differs from open taco\nis they're focused on like you can\ncontrol the grid using the Terraform\nprovider. My goal is I'm giving you an\nSDK. I can generate the terapform\nprovider from the SDK. I can generate um\nJavaScript integrations with the grid\nwhich is what I'm doing for my project\nbecause I want you know and I want\nadditional endpoints control. I want to\ncontrol what is it that you can attach\nto a state. I want to be able or to the\ndependencies the outputs itself. That's\nwhat I want to control. So um so I'm\ndoing this currently with with specit\nand I'm telling you this like 14 days\nnow and I've been able to bootstrap the\nrepo, build the state dependency logic,\nadd some CLI improvements, wire up the\ndashboard um and now I'm working on\nauthentication and authorization. So\nOIDC integration\n>> actually I'm curious what it ends up\ndoing there. I was think in a web app or\nwhatever app is always interesting. So\nmy prompt was very very dumb. Um and it\ntook me I think the last [clears throat]\neight hours to\n>> I want to out because no tech right\nyou're not supposed to say the tech. So\nit's like I need to add authentication\nauthorization and arbback control. I\nwant to um basically protect both the\ncontrol plane. Well actually somebody\nelse onem I think I think again go codex\ndoesn't doesn't give a Codex just\nwent and changed my prompt cuz I didn't\ngive it that prompt. I gave it a much\nsimpler prompt and Codex went like\nactually the user is doing a lot more\nand he's like we have a control plane\nwhich is our grid API and then we have\nthe data plane which is the terraform\ninteracting with the terapform state. So\nboth of them need to be covered by\nauthorization and I need to expose like\nthe authentication token to the\nterraform process so that it can\nactually run the apply. So it's very\ninteresting. Uh I think I've nailed the\ntasks now. I'm pretty sure I can get\nthis like authentication. Well, I'll be\ninterested because I think this one\nmight be one that it might trip on up\non, but uh cool.\n>> Hey,\n>> I'll let you know. Hey,\n>> that was awesome, Vincent. Oh, one more\nthing. Just one more thing.\n>> So, so I just ran the apply, right? So,\nright now it shows that it has conf\nconsumed and they are clean.\n>> Now, what happens when the network\nchanges? Like that happens all the time,\nright? People recreate network.\n>> Why did you say clean and and and stale?\nI mean, that's doesn't seem like the the\nright terminology. I mean, with drift\nwith drift detection in terraform, it's\nthey do they say stale and clean? I've\ngone\n>> I have no idea. I just\n>> Okay, you just made them up. Okay,\nwhatever.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, there's a thing here with the\nnetwork. For some reason, every time you\napply uh a time stamp forces the VPC to\nbe recreated.\n>> Very convenient.\nSo at this point this one has changed\nand recreated the output. And if I\nrefresh now we see that the subnets are\nthe same but the VPCS. Well, this is not\nrealistic example, right? But that's why\n>> it's interesting because it flags um a\ntypical problem, right?\n>> Yes. So this is one of the problems of\nthe integration registry, right? Where\nwe're not able to keep track of like who\nlost the value. This is actually 100%\nopen taco because they have an in digest\nand an out digest on the edge when the\nwhen you dry these edges. So whenever a\nstate files get written it keep captures\nthe outputs and writes out the out\ndigest and all the other states whenever\nthey apply they they they um observe the\nincoming outputs and they write out\ntheir indigest. So, whenever the\nindigest and the out digest differs,\nthat's when an arrow is no longer um\nclean, basically.\n>> I don't quite understand, but I'll have\nto try it, I guess.\n>> Yeah, never mind. Like,\n>> okay, so time time out, man. My brain is\nabout to turn to to mush.\n>> That's it. That's it, really. Um\n>> thanks, Vincent. And if if anyone got\nthis far, I I really applaud you. You\n>> look I think we're gonna cut this.\nI drive for 4 hours to work uh because I\nwork in London. So I I don't mind long\nform content to be honest. It's better\nthan listening to like hey,\nyou know, I kind of\n>> I think you will look Ah, you mean like\nlast time when I cut it, it was too\nmuch.\n>> No, no, I think I think I think I think\nyou do what what I would do. You mean\nyou cut it pretty well for the first\nthird, but the two the last two/3s you\ndidn't cut it.\nI mean, that was my impression. Maybe\nyou cut it so well I didn't even notice.\n>> Uh, I don't remember. But I do try to.\n>> This is two hours of content. It's It's\ngoing to be so hard to cut it. But if\nyou want to cut it, you do you, Vincent.\n>> You don't know me. I I record myself\nusing Speckit for four hours and I cut\nit down into like a 30 minute like to\nthe interesting section.\n>> I do.\n>> So you're uploading videos of you using\nSpeckit already. I have loom I share\nwith my colleagues or with my friends\nand then I see nobody watch it.\n>> Come on, [laughter] get a YouTube\nchannel. Get a YouTube channel.\n>> Someone will watch. I don't know who you\nare, but thank you.\n>> Okay, see you.\n>> I don't know how am I going to get this.\nYeah. See you. Have a lunch or whatever.\n>> Yeah. Bye. You too. Cheers. Good night.",

I I I came to Vietnam in 2006\n[0:08] and um I worked 10 years as a\n[0:11] professional services\n[0:13] um consultant implementing ERP systems\n[0:17] like financial management system called\n[0:20] infor systems. And so that was mostly\n[0:23] with international clients. So I was\n[0:25] based out of Vietnam but I would be\n[0:27] traveling all the time. And my\n[0:29] background is software engineering, but\n[0:32] um I spent 10 years training people on\n[0:36] how to enter invoices into an accounting\n[0:39] system without knowing anything about\n[0:41] accounting initially. Um, so that was\n[0:44] like and that's kind of where I learned\n[0:46] that you really only understand\n[0:49] something if you\n[0:51] um if you can explain it to someone else\n[0:54] but also you get a very different\n[0:56] perspective from other people cuz they\n[0:58] put me in front of like manuals of this\n[1:00] accounting system and they said okay in\n[1:02] one month you're going to the customer\n[1:04] you're going to shadow a senior first\n[1:05] and then later you're going to have to\n[1:07] do the trainings on your own.\n[1:08] >> So you're training like Vietnamese?\n[1:11] >> No, no, no. International. So I was\n[1:12] based out of Vietnam, but um the company\n[1:15] I worked for had a very big contract\n[1:17] with Hilton Hotels Worldwide. So I went\n[1:20] mostly to Hilton hotels like Gardening\n[1:23] or\n[1:24] >> Are you allowed to say these people's\n[1:26] names\n[1:27] or do I have to retract?\n[1:30] >> No, it's fine. [laughter] I worked 10\n[1:32] years um for\n[1:35] pretty much mainly on Hilton and some\n[1:37] other hospitality clients.\n[1:39] >> All right. But yeah, I mean it's it's\n[1:42] not a secret.\n[1:44] >> Yeah.\n[1:44] >> Then how did you get into infrastructure\n[1:46] then? How did you become a Kubern I mean\n[1:49] I think I knew you back in Singapore as\n[1:51] a Kubernetes um zealot,\n[1:54] >> right?\n[1:55] >> Made me absolutely made which made me\n[1:57] want to push you away because I I I I\n[2:00] just had bad experience after bad\n[2:02] experience with with Kubernetes. I mean\n[2:04] I use community don't get me wrong and\n[2:07] when it when it's appropriate but uh it\n[2:09] it does frustrate me.\n[2:11] >> Yeah. So after about you know 7 years of\n[2:15] going to customers. So from 2006 until\n[2:18] 2013 about um most of the time I would\n[2:21] you know we would we would be there to a\n[2:25] whole day to install a Windows systems\n[2:27] you know we would be having a word\n[2:28] document and we would have our\n[2:30] installation you know with the\n[2:32] requirements for the client because\n[2:34] every\n[2:35] customer we work with they have\n[2:37] different requirements. if they are a\n[2:38] real estate investment fund in\n[2:40] Luxembourg, they have different security\n[2:42] requirements than the hospitality like\n[2:44] the way that they manage the servers,\n[2:45] the way that you get access to a server.\n[2:47] And I also worked for Gadak Cement which\n[2:49] is a whole wholesim subsidiary in\n[2:51] Azarban and I worked and always had to\n[2:55] like follow these manual like\n[2:57] installation steps from a word document\n[3:00] and I wrote a lot of PowerShell scripts\n[3:02] to kind of like automate that process,\n[3:04] you know. I had a lot of fun with with\n[3:06] like um active is it ADO active objects\n[3:11] from Microsoft uh inn net. So so with\n[3:14] PowerShell you actually have like the\n[3:16] whole net. So you could create any\n[3:18] object that the Windows system had and I\n[3:20] could load like uh access database\n[3:23] files. So some of this software that I\n[3:25] worked with used access databases. So I\n[3:28] could use PowerShell to load the access\n[3:30] database, read some of the data, modify\n[3:32] it. So I started making\n[3:34] >> back now. Gosh, you you must be as old\n[3:36] as I am.\n[3:37] >> Yeah. So, so that was a lot of fun like\n[3:40] because we had a lot of bash scripts and\n[3:42] stuff that other consultants had built.\n[3:45] Um but yeah, I mean we as we do the same\n[3:48] thing a lot. So we try to optimize our\n[3:50] work, right? So, so we have some\n[3:51] internal scripts that we have and um\n[3:55] that's part of our professional services\n[3:57] our our um you know expertise that we\n[3:59] bring to to to okay supply the system\n[4:02] right so I I actually spent a lot of\n[4:04] time building unattended install scripts\n[4:07] with powershell\n[4:08] >> uh and it wasn't once I saw one customer\n[4:11] which was kadak cementin they had the\n[4:14] whole VMware that was back in 201 I\n[4:17] don't know 2011 maybe before that VMware\n[4:20] was already spread quite in a lot of\n[4:22] places, but\n[4:24] >> I was working on like preparing a\n[4:25] training session and I had everything\n[4:27] set up on my virtual machine, but then I\n[4:29] had to copy over the settings to the the\n[4:31] actual client server for um for an a\n[4:33] training session and I said, \"Oh no, um\n[4:36] I ran out of time and one of the IT\n[4:38] administrators says, \"You have you're\n[4:40] running VMware.\n[4:42] Um what's your IP address? let me clone\n[4:46] the VM machine from your laptop and I'll\n[4:48] create four copies for every attendee.\n[4:51] Yeah. And I was like what the hell?\n[4:54] [laughter]\n[4:54] So, so you know after you know spending\n[4:56] all this time you know creating\n[4:59] screenshots so we have a document we we\n[5:01] we take screenshots of what we have\n[5:03] actually done on their machine and then\n[5:05] you know hand over to the IT\n[5:06] administrator. um you know after doing\n[5:09] that flow in many um you know for many\n[5:11] customers I come to this place and\n[5:13] they're like let me you know let me\n[5:14] connect to your laptop to the VMware\n[5:16] port and copy the VM. I was like, uh,\n[5:18] okay, what the hell? At that point, I\n[5:20] kind of realized that all of this\n[5:22] Windows manual process is kind of\n[5:25] nonsense. And I started looking also I\n[5:28] wanted to run game servers. And I\n[5:30] learned I I had like we we bought like a\n[5:32] Power Edge Dell server that we wanted to\n[5:34] put in a data center like a colo in in\n[5:37] Vietnam with a friend to run games on\n[5:39] it. And he needed Windows.\n[5:41] >> Yeah. I wanted Counter Strike uh you\n[5:44] CS:GO at the time,\n[5:45] >> right around 2013. And um at the time he\n[5:50] needed Windows for he he ran a big\n[5:53] gaming uh news website iame.vietnam in\n[5:56] Vietnam and um he needed he wanted to\n[5:59] host an up andcoming game but it was\n[6:01] Windows only. So I ran my my we needed\n[6:04] to run VMs right Windows and um and\n[6:07] Linux and so then I also wanted to have\n[6:09] better performance because as soon as\n[6:11] you run Counter Strike in the VM you\n[6:13] start having performance problems. So I\n[6:15] started to play with like Linux\n[6:17] containers uh and Docker at the time and\n[6:20] that's how I got into Docker originally\n[6:22] and I started going to to uh meetups in\n[6:25] in Vietnam to learn about like I want to\n[6:27] ingest because I wanted to get create a\n[6:29] gaming platform for Counterstrike that\n[6:31] was like ESL existed, HLTV existed.\n[6:34] Those are very big like Counterstrike\n[6:36] related related services and I felt that\n[6:40] they did not give a lot of like\n[6:42] statistics. There was um fragbite sorry\n[6:45] not fragbite got frag in America they\n[6:48] gave oh and esa they had very detailed\n[6:51] statistics uh like about your\n[6:53] contribution to a round they calculated\n[6:55] so they could assign skill points to a\n[6:57] player much better than most of the\n[6:59] other platforms. Yeah. So I was like I\n[7:02] had built gaming I had run gaming\n[7:04] tournaments in in Belgium. So I knew how\n[7:06] to get all of the logs so you could get\n[7:08] every single event from the locks. So\n[7:10] you could tell the the Counter-Strike\n[7:12] server to send all the locks to you. And\n[7:14] I was used to like\n[7:16] >> Yeah.\n[7:16] >> Yeah. I was used basically at the time\n[7:18] you used like like IRC bots, you know,\n[7:21] you say a certain keyword and that\n[7:23] message was received and the bot would\n[7:25] would um identify with a regular\n[7:27] expression or whatever or just look if\n[7:28] the if the text starts with a certain\n[7:31] keyword and then it would execute\n[7:32] commands. So people would say things and\n[7:35] if it had that command then the bot\n[7:37] would respond. So, we had like a bot\n[7:39] that would read the Counter Strike logs\n[7:41] and then would keep track of the score\n[7:43] uh and then keep track of like when it\n[7:44] needs to restart or switch the teams so\n[7:47] they could, you know, manage a\n[7:48] tournament. So, I was like, cool, I just\n[7:50] need to ingest all of the the statistics\n[7:52] about the players. So, I wanted to build\n[7:54] like a platform and I I learned Angular\n[7:56] and NodeJS and Python and try to build\n[7:59] this on my own at the same time, you\n[8:00] know, as a side project. And I I then\n[8:03] really got into Docker and and and go to\n[8:06] meetup. So I I got into the Docker\n[8:07] meetups and and then\n[8:11] >> Yeah, that's cool. Like a lot I mean I I\n[8:13] basically got into this into this game\n[8:15] through gaming and I think that's a very\n[8:18] common uh\n[8:19] >> what do you call it? Origin story for a\n[8:21] lot of people in this business.\n[8:22] >> Yeah.\n[8:24] >> Servers to infrastructure engineers.\n[8:27] >> Yes. And also um going to the meetups\n[8:31] gave you a lot of like insights um into\n[8:35] what other people were doing and allowed\n[8:36] you to talk to people and figure out\n[8:39] like even though I was at my day job I\n[8:41] was working for 10 years with like these\n[8:44] just financial accounting systems and\n[8:46] building you know nets power and\n[8:48] powershell scripts and and things like\n[8:50] that and then now I was like learning\n[8:52] bash python docker like immutable\n[8:55] servers and and and So that was like\n[8:57] really exciting and interesting you know\n[9:00] um but\n[9:02] >> but then you then you got into\n[9:03] Kubernetes hard.\n[9:06] >> Yeah. So one of the meetups that was\n[9:08] around 2014 after the Google people had\n[9:12] announced Kubernetes as a project uh at\n[9:15] the Docker Con. Um it looked way\n[9:18] overkill like initially when I looked at\n[9:21] what they talked about the cublet that\n[9:22] was interesting. Yeah. you could run\n[9:24] that separately to get like information\n[9:26] about your docker demon and the\n[9:28] containers on your host. So that was\n[9:29] like yeah maybe I like the cublet but I\n[9:31] don't like this everything else right\n[9:33] and then\n[9:34] >> the control plane is quite good isn't it\n[9:36] like\n[9:36] >> it was absolutely crazy in the beta. So\n[9:38] back in 2014 uh I think around September\n[9:42] they they went from beta to like sta\n[9:45] stable v1 um around September. So they\n[9:49] had announced it in July and it looked\n[9:51] really complicated and at the time I was\n[9:53] using digital ocean because I didn't\n[9:55] know AWS and I wanted like simple VPS,\n[9:58] right? A a droplet cost like $5 a month\n[10:01] >> and it was great for a hobby, right?\n[10:03] >> Ocean was great, wasn't it? It was so\n[10:05] easy.\n[10:06] >> Yeah. And and but they had also um an a\n[10:10] bounty like if you if you propose an\n[10:12] article and they approved it, then they\n[10:14] would give you like $30 credit to run.\n[10:17] >> Oh. and and write the article for them\n[10:20] and their ex\n[10:21] >> sorry\n[10:22] >> that was a brilliant idea to get people\n[10:24] engaged. Yeah.\n[10:25] >> Yeah. So to to basically create a huge\n[10:26] knowledge base and to have the community\n[10:28] build a lot of interesting use cases on\n[10:30] top of digital ocean and there was an\n[10:32] article from a guy who worked at digital\n[10:34] ocean I think about setting up\n[10:36] Kubernetes on digital ocean droplets but\n[10:38] it was like you originally kubernetes\n[10:40] was all bash shell scripts like you had\n[10:42] to run this script to to build this and\n[10:45] that. I mean it was horrible\n[10:47] installation mechanism and then Kelsey\n[10:49] High Tower had written this um guide for\n[10:52] core OS. So I was using coros a lot\n[10:54] which is like\n[10:55] >> yeah o really good\n[10:56] >> everything is is through systemd unit.\n[10:59] So it was all systemd and then they\n[11:01] built their their fleet\n[11:03] >> on top of system.\n[11:04] >> I love the upgrade mechanism where where\n[11:06] >> yeah so they have dual boot and they had\n[11:08] like a locksmith um to basic and was was\n[11:11] from coros right they used to to track\n[11:15] um the whole fleet when one acquired the\n[11:18] lock to reboot into the second\n[11:19] partition. They also used the idea of\n[11:21] channels. So if you are running on a\n[11:23] certain version of chores and you're\n[11:25] subscribed to like the stable channel\n[11:26] and a new version is available, it would\n[11:28] you know behind the scenes download the\n[11:30] second uh the new version on a second\n[11:32] partition and then it would\n[11:34] >> I think that came\n[11:36] OS\n[11:37] >> slight slight little ch tangent before\n[11:40] Chrome OS I had my startup web converger\n[11:42] which had an update mechanism which I\n[11:44] thought was quite novel I still think\n[11:45] it's novel and that was based on git. So\n[11:48] basically the whole root of the the OS\n[11:52] is checked into git and then the idea is\n[11:54] that it once it's running you do a git\n[11:57] pull and that's how it gets the sort of\n[11:59] like deltas and then on reboot it checks\n[12:02] out the new um updates. Um, so I was\n[12:06] quite and I'm still am quite uh well uh\n[12:12] boasting well boasting or promoting my\n[12:14] method over the Chrome OS one because I\n[12:15] still think the Chrome OS one is a\n[12:17] little bit overkill but anyway,\n[12:19] >> right? Um so so the cool thing was I\n[12:21] really loved Coros and Kelsey was\n[12:23] working at Coros and had this very nice\n[12:25] guide on how to set up a Kubernetes\n[12:27] fleet using Coros. Um but he had only\n[12:30] examples for AWS and at the time maybe\n[12:32] even Google Cloud. was before he he\n[12:34] joined Google and those guides were like\n[12:37] first you have to create your your uh\n[12:40] your private key infrastructure your PKI\n[12:44] >> Kubernetes is the hard way that's how it\n[12:45] starts I believe\n[12:47] >> well it was the hard way before the hard\n[12:48] way was a thing [laughter] so I I wrote\n[12:51] this this guide for for digital ocean\n[12:54] which was massive you know it started by\n[12:57] you know bootstrapping your PII with\n[13:00] selfert like self-signed certificate\n[13:02] authority generating different client\n[13:04] keys for the SC CD client setting up\n[13:07] flannel you know and I I did a full deep\n[13:10] dive into like how does\n[13:12] >> I've forgotten it sounds\n[13:13] >> flannel was a core o um pxlan packet\n[13:15] encapsulation system so it's basically\n[13:17] to create the overlay network right um\n[13:19] when kubernetes that's one of the great\n[13:21] things about kubernetes right every\n[13:23] container within the fleet must talk to\n[13:25] must be able to talk to other containers\n[13:27] that may be running on different\n[13:29] machines so they create this overlay\n[13:32] network on top of the underlaying cloud\n[13:35] network. So you create like maybe three\n[13:36] core o droplets and then you create a\n[13:39] bunch of flannel um demons that keep\n[13:43] track of the range of IP addresses\n[13:46] containers within their host can have\n[13:48] and then flannel whenever a network\n[13:50] packet comes in encapsulates it that\n[13:52] network packet on the overlay network\n[13:55] encapsulate it in the underlay network\n[13:57] to then send it to the right node and\n[13:59] then that decapsulated and then send it\n[14:01] okay the source is this container. So,\n[14:03] so Flannel was a very basic one you\n[14:05] backed by CD and then um kind of merged\n[14:09] with Calico because Kalico added\n[14:11] additional ways of encapsulation that um\n[14:13] were less like latency in introduced\n[14:17] less latency. So, so it was super\n[14:20] interesting. I mean all of these tools\n[14:21] came out of Coros um and actually this\n[14:24] was after somebody within the Docker\n[14:26] meetup had asked like hey you know this\n[14:28] Kubernetes thing does somebody want to\n[14:29] look at it and I had and and it was\n[14:31] around the V1 release. So a lot of these\n[14:34] stuff was um you know getting\n[14:36] stabilized. Uh so there were less bash\n[14:38] scripts to download all the all the\n[14:40] binaries. You actually had proper Golang\n[14:41] binaries that you could download from\n[14:43] the releases. And so I was able to to\n[14:47] talk about it like watching Brandon\n[14:49] Burns and Kelsey High Tower talk about\n[14:50] Kubernetes and seeing the live demo of\n[14:53] Kelsey High Tower where he just you know\n[14:55] triggers uh a replica set. I think it\n[14:58] was later that they introduced\n[15:00] deployments. Originally it was um\n[15:01] replication\n[15:03] uh it was not replica set it was like\n[15:05] replica controller\n[15:07] um but it was very confusing because the\n[15:10] name of the object was called like a\n[15:13] replication controller where you give it\n[15:15] the number of pots you want to run uh\n[15:17] but then in real in reality the\n[15:19] controller is something that runs inside\n[15:21] the AP inside the control plane that\n[15:23] that looks at the request and the actual\n[15:26] object is the replica set is how many\n[15:28] you want to run of them right so then\n[15:29] they renamed it on v 1.1 or 1.2 and they\n[15:33] introduced a thing called the deployment\n[15:35] to basically control the rollover\n[15:36] mechanism like how do you want to roll\n[15:38] out between different replica sets. Uh\n[15:40] so that was all introduced around the\n[15:43] time that I went to for Asia in in\n[15:45] Singapore uh and do a presentation about\n[15:47] Kubernetes there. So I was talking about\n[15:50] this amazing, you know, mechanism of\n[15:52] replication controllers and then they\n[15:55] changed it all to replica sets and I was\n[15:57] like I'm very confused about this new\n[15:58] stuff.\n[15:59] >> I was a little bit puzzled about replica\n[16:00] sets myself because because ultimately\n[16:04] >> it seemed attached to to how you would\n[16:07] want to scale your app because because\n[16:09] if you have too many replicas then you\n[16:11] you're going to maybe take too many too\n[16:14] many uh CPU or whatever RAM resources.\n[16:18] And I thought\n[16:19] >> everything it changed so much\n[16:20] >> like how like if I'm running my app how\n[16:23] many replicas do I need? Do I need two\n[16:24] three four five 10? Do I do I do it to\n[16:27] to maximize the resour so\n[16:30] >> like I I never\n[16:31] >> when I'm talking about 2014 15 all of\n[16:33] that was like very basic. Um today you\n[16:36] would obviously use like autoscaling you\n[16:38] would um even you have vertical\n[16:40] autoscaling now you can resize pods\n[16:42] without restarting them. Those are all\n[16:44] things that you can do stable because\n[16:46] like I just\n[16:48] it is\n[16:50] >> because because a few years ago I just\n[16:51] thought I I just don't trust this\n[16:53] autoscaler but um but yeah may maybe I'm\n[16:58] >> so so that that's how I got into it\n[16:59] right I mean initially I was doing coros\n[17:02] for my friend startup um and every time\n[17:05] the droplet every time cor updated\n[17:07] nobody has access anymore because\n[17:09] [laughter] I was maintaining their SSH\n[17:11] keys separately\n[17:12] >> what was relation ship between core o\n[17:14] and kubernetes because coros came out of\n[17:18] docker didn't it? No what did it\n[17:19] >> no coros is a was a company um that was\n[17:22] also called coros and they had an um\n[17:25] they had an operating system called\n[17:27] coros which was a container centric\n[17:30] operating system. So you would run even\n[17:32] your debug tools you would run\n[17:34] everything through contra containers and\n[17:36] the actual it was kind of like a\n[17:37] precursor to Talos uh today I think\n[17:40] >> um that idea of like using docker images\n[17:43] to like I don't know um get your basic\n[17:47] bash or something well I mean bash is\n[17:49] not a good example but like your tooling\n[17:51] yeah\n[17:51] >> yeah and and chores originally they they\n[17:53] had their own scheduler right um that\n[17:56] they built separate from kubernetes\n[17:58] which was fleet and fleet\n[18:01] They basically extended the idea of a\n[18:04] systemd unit to um to something that you\n[18:07] could run across multiple nodes and you\n[18:09] had some scheduling constraints on the\n[18:11] systemd unit. I forgot the name of it\n[18:13] that uh it was a set of units or\n[18:15] something like that. Uh but as\n[18:17] Kubernetes became more popular they\n[18:20] deprecated their own fleet and they\n[18:22] started they adopted um Kubernetes and\n[18:24] then they built their own flavor of it\n[18:26] called tectonic.\n[18:27] >> The Kubernetes is system D3. Um, so it\n[18:30] feels like systemd went head-to-head\n[18:32] with Kubernetes and Kubernetes one,\n[18:34] right?\n[18:35] >> M, not really. I mean, systemd was the\n[18:38] way to run like was replacing your\n[18:41] upstart and your init systems on the\n[18:43] operating system, right? And Redhead\n[18:44] made it the default and a lot of uh\n[18:46] distributions like rejected it, but then\n[18:48] Ubuntu adopted it and then everyone\n[18:50] followed.\n[18:51] >> Uses a different well c what what's the\n[18:53] name of the control plan? cublet or\n[18:55] whatever to\n[18:56] >> uh no kubernetes completely decoupled\n[18:58] from it like systemd was purely your\n[19:00] init system on your operating on your\n[19:03] >> how does kubernetes managed the pods and\n[19:06] >> well that's the container runtime\n[19:09] >> right\n[19:10] >> so the container runtime interface so\n[19:12] originally a lot of them use docker to\n[19:15] to use to basically like pull the\n[19:18] container image set up the file system\n[19:20] launch the process within the cont like\n[19:22] the name spaces and the control groups\n[19:24] set everything up for you, right? Um,\n[19:26] and then over time there was this uh\n[19:29] split between Docker and Coros because\n[19:32] um Docker was moving fast and breaking\n[19:34] things and so Red Hat froze the Docker\n[19:36] versions and then Coros created a new\n[19:39] project called Rocket which is using\n[19:41] systemdspawn.\n[19:43] >> Yeah, systemdspawn. Yes.\n[19:46] >> And that was like Leonard uh was it name\n[19:49] Leonard like pit one\n[19:52] >> butering. Yeah, he he he basically said\n[19:55] he came to Singapore as well talked\n[19:57] about like systemd and spawn is how I\n[19:59] debug. Yeah, systemdspawn is how I debug\n[20:03] um kernels. So I use systemdnspawn all\n[20:07] time. It's a very solid product and then\n[20:09] Cororo built rocket on top of it and\n[20:12] they added um the good thing about this\n[20:15] competition was that they said like okay\n[20:17] Docker is using very insecure uh like\n[20:20] they didn't have proper verification of\n[20:22] the images and and so Koro said we need\n[20:26] to focus on that and Docker was like\n[20:27] that's not our priority our priority is\n[20:28] developer experience and Coro says okay\n[20:31] we're building systemdspawn and we're\n[20:33] adding this GPG based signing of images\n[20:36] and and layer like image layer\n[20:38] verification like basically what\n[20:39] enterprises need for security and the\n[20:41] response of docker was there well you're\n[20:44] using gpg is so old we use tuf like the\n[20:46] update framework and we are using like a\n[20:49] notary for signing layers and and they\n[20:51] they came up with like a new completely\n[20:52] new tool set I think docker at the time\n[20:54] had a lot of money as well a lot of VC\n[20:56] investments and so they docker was like\n[20:58] this one company and and Solomon hike\n[21:00] was like fighting super hard against\n[21:02] these giants Google redhead and and\n[21:05] others and And um\n[21:07] >> yeah, they had their own and whatever.\n[21:10] >> Yeah. So when when they did a Docker con\n[21:12] that year that um Cor and Stroet, they\n[21:15] made an exposition about like um the the\n[21:19] whale at the start of the conference.\n[21:21] They did something. I only watched\n[21:22] everything on Twitter. I I never went to\n[21:24] any of these events, but I saw on\n[21:25] Twitter that they had like this this\n[21:27] opening of the conference and the rocket\n[21:29] launch failed. And hint hint, rocket\n[21:32] failed. Like [laughter] they would do\n[21:33] these things all the time. Oh man, we\n[21:35] can I'm just conscious we this is\n[21:37] supposed to be the intro for your grid\n[21:39] um app.\n[21:42] >> Oh my god. This is going to be a video\n[21:43] onto itself almost\n[21:44] >> but like\n[21:45] >> No, no, no. Yeah, just a background.\n[21:47] >> Why did core OS fail actually?\n[21:50] >> It didn't fail. It was acquired by\n[21:51] Redhead.\n[21:54] >> Okay. Well, they did I mean it did fail\n[21:55] in my book because it did seem to go out\n[21:58] of the view that it seems to have lost\n[22:01] minds. I think the biggest problem was\n[22:03] they had built tectonic which was like a\n[22:05] terraform based kubernetes flavor. So\n[22:08] they had their own um boot system. So\n[22:11] they had like this um cloud init\n[22:14] extension called I forgot ignition. They\n[22:16] had this ignition u it's like user data\n[22:19] on steroids uh for pixie booting on on\n[22:21] on networks like your coros and so on.\n[22:24] It was amazing like I never ran cor OS\n[22:26] on on LAN but they they were focused on\n[22:29] like enterprise customers not\n[22:30] necessarily running in the cloud and\n[22:32] Tectonic was all Terraform with like\n[22:34] ignition provider and the problem was\n[22:38] Tectonic was really expensive like the\n[22:40] license to run Tectonic like you could\n[22:43] run it for free but you wouldn't get\n[22:45] some of the like SSO and other\n[22:47] enterprise features so originally\n[22:49] Tectonic\n[22:50] >> was their their commercial offering What\n[22:54] is the link with Terraform? You you you\n[22:56] would use Terraform to provision it or\n[22:58] something or\n[22:58] >> Yeah. So they they had the like Tectonic\n[23:00] was basically a whole bunch of Terraform\n[23:02] packaged up with Kubernetes bootstrap\n[23:04] with ignition with on top of core OS. So\n[23:06] it would give you a fleet of coros um\n[23:08] nodes and it would bootstrap CD and the\n[23:11] control plane for Kubernetes and it\n[23:13] would bootstrap every node to join the\n[23:15] cluster properly and all that. So\n[23:17] tectonic on top of that it was a bit\n[23:19] like open shift right. So, so at the\n[23:21] time a lot of these kubernetes\n[23:23] distributions came out like open shift\n[23:25] um from ranch like there was wrencher\n[23:28] and there was also from fedora or susi\n[23:30] linux they had also their own flavor and\n[23:32] pretty much everyone was launching their\n[23:34] kubernetes flavor\n[23:36] >> um and before the clouds launched them\n[23:38] like Google had\n[23:39] >> I think had nothing\n[23:43] >> yeah I did not like it\n[23:46] >> it was I mean it's the same thing with\n[23:47] like I I So my background's always been\n[23:51] very operational.\n[23:52] >> Sorry,\n[23:53] >> it was the most minimal one. I think\n[23:54] that's why I was attracted to\n[23:55] >> it was the most like easy one like\n[23:58] docker compos like the reason developers\n[24:00] like to run docker compose is because\n[24:02] it's easy almost no dials and knobs same\n[24:06] like wrencher you would just run it it\n[24:07] would just run it would spin up\n[24:08] everything and it would just run and I\n[24:10] hated that because I I was deep into\n[24:12] like spinning up my CD my own\n[24:14] certificates my own you know user data\n[24:16] at that time. So, so, so the thing is I,\n[24:19] you know, you start digging in really\n[24:22] deep and then as you are, you know, I\n[24:25] wasn't working at a company that was\n[24:27] like having real needs. I I wasn't\n[24:29] working at any company using Kubernetes,\n[24:31] right? So, for I was doing this all for\n[24:33] fun. So, all of this stuff that took\n[24:35] away my fun like rancher that was no\n[24:37] good. I wanted to do it myself. So I\n[24:40] remember very early somebody asked like\n[24:42] I was talking about running a mail\n[24:44] server on the on on on digital ocean\n[24:46] lotion and somebody said why wouldn't\n[24:47] you just use AWS and I was like oh you\n[24:49] know why would I pay all of this extra\n[24:51] money [laughter] I can do it myself and\n[24:53] then of course you you get called\n[24:56] >> Yeah. No and then you get called in\n[24:57] these problems um because my friend\n[24:59] startup he's trying to send emails and\n[25:01] then they go into like the they go into\n[25:04] >> Yeah. they go in quarantine and then\n[25:06] he's like, \"Oh, Vincent, what is this?\n[25:07] Like our our spam house uh reputation is\n[25:11] bad and and then it's because you're\n[25:12] using digital ocean IPs and they are\n[25:15] obviously like blacklisted in spam house\n[25:17] and so then you start to get all of\n[25:19] these issues and also you know once I\n[25:23] got all of the Kubernetes figured out\n[25:25] and I could [clears throat] do cluster\n[25:26] upgrades easily and all of that and then\n[25:28] you don't want to bother with it anymore\n[25:30] after a while like that's done. you've\n[25:32] you've played enough with it and now you\n[25:33] want to just focus on deploying things\n[25:35] on top of it. So it took a while to get\n[25:38] to that stage and also when you're in a\n[25:39] company and you have to deliver a\n[25:40] business value and not just spin up\n[25:42] clusters\n[25:43] >> then you start to say actually you know\n[25:45] I can use\n[25:46] >> in your current role are you still a\n[25:48] Kubernetes u uh monkey or whatever the\n[25:51] term is for\n[25:53] >> uh so my last role that I use Kubernetes\n[25:56] was like two years ago.\n[25:58] >> Okay. So now you've like gone\n[25:59] terraformish. Well, you got CDK or\n[26:02] >> Yeah. Um\n[26:05] I I really was interested about CDK. I\n[26:07] just never had the opportunity to play\n[26:08] with it, right?\n[26:09] >> Um so so I got into\n[26:12] >> an organization that used CDK and then\n[26:15] um I saw the benefits of it and and then\n[26:18] also I worked with I worked plenty of\n[26:20] times that I trained people how to use\n[26:21] Kubernetes. And when you use something\n[26:24] like ECS and you have something like CDK\n[26:26] that can create container definitions or\n[26:28] Fargate backed uh you know just define\n[26:31] my workload it's so much easier to to\n[26:33] work with than if you have to like you\n[26:36] know define everything with Argo CD and\n[26:38] GitHubs and and endless lines of YAML\n[26:40] and and so again it's one of those\n[26:42] things that's very interesting for a\n[26:44] while and then once you've done it you\n[26:46] get really bored of it [laughter]\n[26:48] you know initially.\n[26:49] >> Well I mean yeah like I think I\n[26:54] empathize with you. I I we we we're all\n[26:57] exposed to these these technologies. Um\n[27:02] and and we as you should and like Yeah.\n[27:04] I know about Kubernetes, I know about\n[27:06] Terraform, I know about CDK. The more we\n[27:08] know the better we are really. It's not\n[27:10] like I do find it weird when\n[27:12] >> the more we understand the trade-offs as\n[27:14] well.\n[27:14] >> Yeah.\n[27:14] >> Because that's a problem. Like we don't\n[27:16] really know the trade-offs. If we only\n[27:17] know one tool, we think this is the best\n[27:19] tool ever until we start using other\n[27:21] >> tools. When people try to sell\n[27:23] themselves as as a Kubernetes\n[27:25] infrastructure engineer, like why don't\n[27:26] you learn learn other things, a dude?\n[27:29] >> But the good thing is though, like I use\n[27:31] Fargate a lot at work now. And there's\n[27:33] several cases where we're like, oh, we\n[27:35] need to do this thing or that thing. And\n[27:36] I'm like, well, that that would just be\n[27:38] an ingress manifest on Kubernetes and\n[27:40] that would just be like something like a\n[27:42] service mesh or like an\n[27:43] >> trade-offs, the comparisons. That's very\n[27:45] >> you very quickly like find the\n[27:47] limitations where you're like well in\n[27:49] Kubernetes I would have I would control\n[27:50] my my service mesh or my uh overlay\n[27:53] network. Uh for example one issue that\n[27:55] we had is we wanted to save cost and use\n[27:59] like memory swappiness and like be able\n[28:02] to because we have very bury workloads\n[28:04] of different um services. So one service\n[28:08] we don't need very big machines but when\n[28:10] they do need the resources when certain\n[28:12] request comes in they they need to be\n[28:14] able to to to take up a lot of memory\n[28:16] and CPU and not necessarily fight each\n[28:18] other. So the idea was to basically\n[28:21] overs subscribe nodes. Uh which you can\n[28:23] do easily with Kubernetes, right? You\n[28:24] can you can have only two nodes and and\n[28:26] give them give your pods a lot of memory\n[28:28] even though you don't have the memory\n[28:30] available. Um Kubernetes will be able to\n[28:33] run them and you can't do that with\n[28:35] Fargate obviously because Fargate you\n[28:37] have to give it exactly what you want\n[28:38] and it's going to run exactly that. You\n[28:40] can't really burst. Um so so then we\n[28:42] needed to run our own ECS nodes and um\n[28:46] that was before AWS announced managed\n[28:48] nodes by the way that they also just\n[28:50] announced like a month ago. Um but\n[28:52] anyway\n[28:54] >> wait a minute AWS has had managed ECS\n[28:56] for a while. I mean Fargate is managed.\n[28:58] What do you mean?\n[28:58] >> No no managed managed autoscaling groups\n[29:00] like um you didn't have that until like\n[29:03] a month ago.\n[29:04] >> Okay, I'll take it away.\n[29:06] [laughter] Okay.\n[29:07] >> Yeah, they they just announced it like\n[29:09] you could spin up right your capacity\n[29:11] providers in ECS can be either Fargate\n[29:14] capacity provider where they take care\n[29:15] of everything and you just say the\n[29:17] dimensions of what you want and they\n[29:18] will just you know make it available but\n[29:20] you can't oversubscribe really much.\n[29:23] >> Okay. I see. Okay. So we I think we need\n[29:26] to to to to what do you call it uh\n[29:29] connect to your your grid project. So,\n[29:33] how would you introduce your grid\n[29:35] project? So, that makes the next video\n[29:38] kind of\n[29:39] >> makes sense.\n[29:40] >> Um,\n[29:42] how do I\n[29:45] >> Well, let me let me see if I can jog\n[29:47] your memory. Like, I think you\n[29:48] introduced grid to me because you said\n[29:49] that, you know, the the whole open tacos\n[29:52] things was interesting, but it it didn't\n[29:54] support strongly typed\n[29:57] >> right\n[29:58] >> stacks. So the grid API is sort of\n[30:01] demonstrating that you can you can\n[30:04] properly track your your infrastructure\n[30:07] state\n[30:08] uh yeah in a compelling way using yeah\n[30:12] the the strongly typed CDK stacks.\n[30:16] >> Yes. So, so a lot of these projects that\n[30:18] were introduced like from Terram team\n[30:23] which is the state graph and from digger\n[30:25] which is the open tackle um they're just\n[30:29] focused on classic terapform which\n[30:32] doesn't expose a lot of the type system\n[30:35] of the resources right so\n[30:38] state graph does promise that every\n[30:40] resource has a type so it should be able\n[30:43] to give you more information it get it\n[30:46] it gets rid of all of the states. So\n[30:48] instead of having like many many small\n[30:50] states, you have one big state graph.\n[30:52] Every resource is in there. Every\n[30:53] resource has like attributes that are\n[30:56] strongly typed. So you don't need to go\n[30:58] through the state as a boundary or as an\n[31:00] encapsulation mechanism. Um because\n[31:03] everything lives next to each other,\n[31:05] right? Um with with Digger they are\n[31:08] still allowing you to create multiple\n[31:10] states and you are able to define the\n[31:12] dependencies between the states and\n[31:14] you're able to define arbback on top of\n[31:16] that and now they're integrating with\n[31:19] work OS for like you know your\n[31:21] deployment mechanisms. I haven't looked\n[31:23] at open taco recently. Um but the both\n[31:26] of them I mean I I I kind of like the\n[31:28] open taco approach because I still\n[31:30] believe that you want to encapsulate\n[31:33] a little bit like the the the for\n[31:35] example the platform team may want to\n[31:37] encapsulate the landing zone that they\n[31:38] provide right um what we as a service\n[31:42] provide to other teams we maybe only\n[31:44] want to expose the subnet ids and the\n[31:46] VPC ID and we don't want to like have\n[31:49] all of the VPC information network\n[31:51] gateways everything uh All these\n[31:54] resources don't mean much for other\n[31:56] teams. We just say this is the landing\n[31:58] zone and we have a couple of outputs for\n[32:00] you, a network ID and a subnet ID and\n[32:02] you can launch in there. Right? So to me\n[32:04] a terapform state as an encapsulation\n[32:06] mechanism still makes sense. I don't\n[32:08] know how state graph is going to solve\n[32:09] that problem. Um and I talked to them\n[32:12] and they were like we want type\n[32:14] information just like you. Um but\n[32:17] they're building it there on their own.\n[32:19] They're doing it in Okamel and I haven't\n[32:21] been really been like able to\n[32:22] communicate with them much\n[32:24] >> in Okamel. Oh man.\n[32:25] >> Yeah. So, so then open taco they're\n[32:29] building this in Golang which is much\n[32:32] more approachable in in a DevOps\n[32:33] ecosystem because you know Terraform\n[32:35] Kubernetes everything is Golang. So,\n[32:37] Golang tooling uh is is available and I\n[32:41] try to talk to them but they don't\n[32:43] really respond at all and also because\n[32:46] of the reaction of the community towards\n[32:48] open taco it feels a little bit like\n[32:50] persona non grata. So, um I feel like I\n[32:56] want something similar that allows me to\n[33:00] expose the deeply typed information that\n[33:04] I have from my library. So I have a\n[33:06] library that gives you these higher\n[33:09] level constructs. We talked about it. We\n[33:11] showed like this the way that you can\n[33:13] visualize it. You can define like hey by\n[33:15] the way my constructs imple can be\n[33:17] displayed on on a diagram and this is\n[33:19] how it displays itself. So you can add\n[33:21] these interfaces on top of it. Right.\n[33:23] >> That demo that we recorded just for\n[33:26] people's context was recorded like two\n[33:28] weeks ago.\n[33:29] >> You said that you were going to you were\n[33:31] going to specitate the uh the or\n[33:34] >> authentication. Yeah. I think I said\n[33:35] [clears throat] in the video back then\n[33:36] that I don't think it's going to be\n[33:38] painful.\n[33:38] >> It's going to be painful. [snorts]\n[33:40] >> Yeah. So, so the Was I right, Vincent?\n[33:43] For once.\n[33:44] >> Yes, you were right, Kai. [laughter]\n[33:46] You want\n[33:48] Okay. So, so the speckit experiment was\n[33:52] two, three weeks. I think by the time\n[33:54] that we recorded demo, I had spent two\n[33:56] weeks on it and I had it had raced\n[33:58] through all of my questions and it had\n[34:00] built a monor repo with Golang. It had\n[34:02] built a CLI and SDK. has built a UI,\n[34:06] hooked everything up and you was and\n[34:07] that will be shown in the demo. Uh the\n[34:09] one thing missing for me to deploy this\n[34:11] into my organization is to have a strong\n[34:13] authentication and because you know you\n[34:16] want to be able to integrate with SSO uh\n[34:19] and things like that. So I thought you\n[34:21] know I'm just going to ask packet to do\n[34:22] that. And I think my biggest mistake was\n[34:24] to to assume that this could all be done\n[34:26] in like one feature.\n[34:28] >> Uh I didn't break it down. I said like\n[34:30] this is authentication, authorization\n[34:33] and um you know no web login and\n[34:36] everything\n[34:37] >> SL\n[34:39] no SL just OIDC uh and and so specit did\n[34:44] a great job three days planning it um\n[34:47] like I said I spent 70% time planning\n[34:49] and then 40% time implementing for some\n[34:51] other features so I was like I was very\n[34:53] confident I was done with the planning\n[34:54] phase um however it kind of\n[34:57] >> when when you say planning phase were\n[34:59] you using like the plan mode of claude\n[35:01] or would you use plan mode of spot?\n[35:04] >> Yes, because the plan mode of cloud\n[35:06] works within a context window, right?\n[35:07] And then as soon as a context window is\n[35:10] done, maybe you can carry over like with\n[35:12] a compact, you can carry over some to-do\n[35:13] items, but it's very limited and a lot\n[35:15] of context gets lost. So the spec kits\n[35:18] planning phase is really focused on\n[35:19] capturing all of the functional\n[35:21] requirements and like gap analysis and\n[35:23] edge cases and writing that down into\n[35:24] markdown.\n[35:25] >> Did you ever play with beads in the end,\n[35:27] Steve?\n[35:28] Did you find Yay or nay?\n[35:31] >> What's your So, so full honesty, I been\n[35:35] playing with it only today and so far um\n[35:40] it does some interesting things. I think\n[35:43] Beats prompts the agent to spend a\n[35:46] little extra time to to do its own\n[35:49] planning phase on each individual issue.\n[35:51] So my my biggest problem with speckit as\n[35:53] doing this oidc which supposedly I said\n[35:56] was going to take me three days and it's\n[35:57] been almost four weeks. Um, my biggest\n[36:01] issue is that the resulting task lists\n[36:04] became a 2,000line markdown file and\n[36:07] even you know even when I start on one\n[36:11] phase maybe six tasks within that\n[36:13] massive list of like 80 tasks um it kind\n[36:17] of like blows the context pretty fast\n[36:19] like hey uh cloud we're going to we've\n[36:22] got this beautiful plan and research and\n[36:24] everything.\n[36:24] >> How do you track the context? is like I\n[36:26] think in Claude you have to go\n[36:27] slashcontext every time and that's\n[36:29] annoying as hell.\n[36:31] >> Yeah. So I there's this status bar thing\n[36:36] now that you can do but I've got only my\n[36:40] >> I don't think you can\n[36:40] >> but there's quite a few people that\n[36:42] write tools that run like demons in the\n[36:44] background that that monitor the context\n[36:46] and so you could run those demons and\n[36:48] then display it in the status bar.\n[36:50] >> How do you track it then? No,\n[36:52] >> I I do context. [laughter]\n[36:54] I haven't installed those state I I just\n[36:56] I just initiated the status bar in my\n[36:58] cloud right now. So I I do have like my\n[37:00] original bash prompt. Um and I seen\n[37:03] people talk on Reddit about hey here's a\n[37:05] demon that shows you your tracks your\n[37:07] usage. You run the demon and then your\n[37:09] your bash prompt can show\n[37:11] >> how everyone wants this but uh they they\n[37:13] haven't delivered on this status bar\n[37:15] shown.\n[37:15] >> But they they have delivered on other\n[37:17] cool stuff but you're really derailing\n[37:18] me. But they have delivered for example\n[37:20] on on the ability to like you can\n[37:22] trigger a plan mode get a plan and then\n[37:24] you can control G edit it control J J\n[37:28] the the G how [clears throat] you say G\n[37:31] >> okay\n[37:31] >> gangster um\n[37:33] >> yeah golf\n[37:34] >> so you can you can edit the plan now\n[37:36] before when the plan wasn't right you\n[37:37] had to you put in a prompt and say no no\n[37:39] no you're missing this and then it would\n[37:41] do another plan and then it would miss\n[37:42] something else\n[37:43] >> okay so going back to beads your\n[37:46] thousand line markdown or whatever you\n[37:48] >> so so this a problem right uh I've got\n[37:50] this massive task list from the speckit\n[37:52] uh research phase and planning phase so\n[37:55] not the cloud mode like not the cloud\n[37:57] code planning but the specit planning\n[37:59] which is multiple steps a big workflow\n[38:02] generates a lot of research and creates\n[38:04] very detailed tasks of like multiple\n[38:06] phases it became huge because my feature\n[38:09] was too big and I should have probably\n[38:10] cut it down but what I'm hoping now um\n[38:14] is with beats it actually parses out the\n[38:18] tasks and tracks them not in a markdown\n[38:21] file but in like a database like an SQL\n[38:23] light right and it synchronize the\n[38:25] database file to a JSON format like JSON\n[38:29] L so you can you know committ it to your\n[38:31] git so you can see the diffs yeah and\n[38:33] they can even handle the merges of\n[38:35] completed task better supposedly but I\n[38:37] haven't done that yet so so with beats\n[38:40] now I had a actually just had a very\n[38:42] nice experience which was it had\n[38:44] completed three tasks and it hadn't\n[38:47] blocked so beats speeds ads workflow and\n[38:49] it had unblocked the next task and then\n[38:51] I was not using son I was using haiku\n[38:54] and haiku\n[38:56] looked at the issue that it needed to\n[38:58] work on the task that it needed to work\n[39:00] on and it went into this like planning\n[39:02] mode which I think is something that\n[39:04] beats introduced because I've never seen\n[39:05] cloud do that until I activated beats\n[39:08] and after it went into the planning mode\n[39:09] it came up with its plan and it was\n[39:12] different from I mean it something\n[39:14] wasn't right I there was some mistakes\n[39:16] in there I was like that's not right And\n[39:17] so the cool thing is I didn't have to\n[39:19] open my markdown file and then scroll\n[39:21] down to this like phase number eight\n[39:23] which is at line 800 and then find\n[39:25] exactly what was the original task that\n[39:27] it was supposed to work on. I could just\n[39:29] run beat show that issue originally that\n[39:32] you started with and I saw immediately\n[39:34] like hey there's a mistake here. Uh and\n[39:37] so it it really allowed me to slice and\n[39:39] dice directly to the particular task. So\n[39:42] instead of having like uh this massive\n[39:43] markdowns that you have to also blow up\n[39:45] your context with you can now like very\n[39:48] directly ask questions about partic\n[39:50] particular issues and look at them and\n[39:52] find the links between them. So because\n[39:54] it creates a graph of issues right so so\n[39:56] far\n[39:57] >> of the the links have you like linked\n[39:59] them up like showing which ones depend\n[40:01] on another or does it do it\n[40:02] automatically?\n[40:03] >> It did it automatically. So I I asked uh\n[40:06] yeah I\n[40:09] I have recorded the loom about this\n[40:11] process. Um but it's a bit messy. Uh\n[40:15] basically what happened is\n[40:18] I was going back and forth between cloud\n[40:20] and Gemini. Gemini is not good at\n[40:21] writing code but it's great at reading\n[40:22] code and giving like a review of another\n[40:25] person of another plan. Codex can do the\n[40:27] same thing but Gemini does it much\n[40:29] faster. So what happened is cloud came\n[40:30] up with this plan. we're going to do\n[40:32] ABC. And then I went to Gemini. I said,\n[40:34] \"Mate, does that make sense? Like, can\n[40:35] you go look if that already exists?\" And\n[40:37] Gemini says, \"No, none of these things\n[40:38] exist. That is but that is\n[40:40] correct.\" So then I went back to cloud\n[40:42] and I came up with like a 300line\n[40:45] um prompt and and then I push push it\n[40:48] into um a new cloud instance with Beats\n[40:51] activated because you have to like\n[40:53] install the MCP, you have to initialize\n[40:54] your agent, you have to make sure that\n[40:57] it knows that it needs to use Beats. And\n[40:59] then I gave it this 300 line prompt that\n[41:01] I fine-tuned with Gemini and it went\n[41:03] ahead and created okay Gemini made it\n[41:05] very clear we need to do this this this\n[41:06] then this and then cloud used beats\n[41:10] created all the issues linked them\n[41:12] together what what depended on what uh\n[41:14] what unblocks what and then created a a\n[41:17] beautiful graph and it started with the\n[41:18] ne the first two issues that were\n[41:20] available.\n[41:20] >> Show a graph.\n[41:22] >> Um\n[41:24] >> you're right. Uh I haven't I haven't\n[41:25] looked at the I haven't seen a graph,\n[41:27] but I've seen the the full JSON output\n[41:29] and I've seen the full list and I've\n[41:31] been able to look at the issues uh very\n[41:33] quickly. So I haven't uh tried the graph\n[41:35] yet but so far like I said I think beads\n[41:40] adds through its MCP tools some\n[41:42] instructions to like prompt cloud when\n[41:46] it picks up an issue to do some\n[41:47] additional research and and the issue\n[41:50] itself that was created by cloud within\n[41:52] beats actually has a lot of context. It\n[41:55] captured all of the requirements,\n[41:56] acceptance criteria and things like\n[41:58] that, which is I was surprised because I\n[42:00] thought, you know, when you have a to-do\n[42:01] list in in cloud, it's just like one\n[42:03] line. I need to do this one thing. I\n[42:05] don't know how cloud tracks more\n[42:07] information than that just one line. But\n[42:09] in Beats, I can see it. Like there's a\n[42:11] title and there's a description. It says\n[42:13] like this is what we need to do. This is\n[42:14] why we need to do it. These are the\n[42:15] files we need to change. And this is the\n[42:17] acceptance criteria. Was like, oh,\n[42:18] that's pretty cool. I'm not sure. I'm\n[42:20] not a thousand% sure it's the MCP\n[42:22] because I noticed when I hit this MCP\n[42:24] bug last week that that uh Claude, for\n[42:28] example, was just invoking the BD CLI\n[42:32] right on my my sh.\n[42:34] >> Yeah, I I had to bootstrap um the agent\n[42:37] to make sure that it has like you need\n[42:39] to use the tools, not not the CLI\n[42:42] >> BD quick start or whatever inside your\n[42:44] agents MD or whatever.\n[42:46] >> Yeah, I did. I did. I did the BD on\n[42:49] boarding. Um, and so yeah, but I also\n[42:53] wanted to originally like why do I need\n[42:54] an MCP? Like I hate MCPS because\n[42:57] >> Yeah, I don't that's what I was going to\n[42:58] say next. I don't think you need an MCP,\n[43:00] but uh just because\n[43:03] >> it was broken and it seemed to still\n[43:05] work.\n[43:06] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And um I also\n[43:08] installed the agent skill. So be beats\n[43:12] also has like this new thing from cloud\n[43:14] called uh a like skills.\n[43:17] >> All right. I think I think on the web\n[43:18] page you can it's called a plugin. Is\n[43:20] that the same thing? No,\n[43:22] >> I'm not sure. So I didn't want to\n[43:24] install the plugin. I I didn't know what\n[43:26] it was going to do. So I actually went\n[43:29] through everything that the plugin does\n[43:30] myself. Like I installed the the the\n[43:32] CLI. I think we you have to do anyway.\n[43:34] You have to install the CLI and then I\n[43:36] used UV to install the tool which is the\n[43:39] MCP. So I can run the MCP directly. I\n[43:41] did not install it as a as a as a as a\n[43:44] plug-in. And then I had to do the the\n[43:46] the gith hooks, but that's part of your\n[43:48] BD init. So when you init in a\n[43:51] repository, it will create your git\n[43:53] hooks. Then it had something like do you\n[43:55] want to go multi-reo? And I think that's\n[43:57] one of the cool features is that it can\n[43:59] do multi-reo. But mine is a very big\n[44:01] monor repo, so I don't want to do that.\n[44:03] So I was like, it gave me a warning.\n[44:04] >> I didn't know that.\n[44:06] >> Yeah, there's a demon.\n[44:08] >> Yeah,\n[44:08] >> that's this is really good. Okay. I\n[44:10] mean, I think we have to cut it here\n[44:11] because I I\n[44:12] >> think we need to do a separate session\n[44:13] on beat. Yeah,\n[44:14] >> I don't know if you have enough for\n[44:15] intro. Uh, but yeah,\n[44:17] >> we got plenty for intro. I mean, I'm\n[44:19] hoping just to cut this. I also need to\n[44:20] go and uh yeah, and I'll time stamp it\n[44:24] so people could skip it if they wanted\n[44:25] to. Okay,\n[44:26] >> by the end of this week, I want to um\n[44:29] try beads with speckit. So now I'm\n[44:31] learning it like on my current task like\n[44:34] but then the next step is I want speckit\n[44:36] not to create this 20,000 line markdown.\n[44:39] I want speckit to use beats. I haven't\n[44:41] done that yet. Um, so I'm using I'm\n[44:43] learning it first. Yeah,\n[44:44] >> sounds awesome. Okay, we'll keep in\n[44:46] touch. See you.\n[44:47] >> Bye. Okay, see you. Have a nice day.\n[44:49] Really really enjoy this. I think we\n[44:50] covered a lot of things. I think\n[44:52] >> maybe.\n[44:53] Okay, one more thing.\n[44:55] >> Um, so so basically we talked about open\n[44:58] taco and all of these state management\n[45:00] solutions also. Now we just talked about\n[45:02] the integration patterns, right? We\n[45:04] mentioned that you can you can use a\n[45:07] variable file on disk or a big config\n[45:09] file that keeps track of all of the\n[45:10] different like a dictionary of all of\n[45:12] the different integration keys. Right?\n[45:14] So at my organization we we started\n[45:18] originally trying to use an integration\n[45:20] registry. Then we move towards like the\n[45:23] teams only publish dev from their\n[45:26] product repo and when they want to go to\n[45:28] staging and need to integrate there they\n[45:30] publish their infrastructure as a\n[45:32] package and then we consume it and\n[45:34] integrate it within our monor repo. So\n[45:36] we have a big terapform monor repo. A\n[45:38] lot of organizations have a big\n[45:39] terapform monor repo because you have\n[45:41] those file system requirements to read\n[45:42] data, right? Um because we couldn't use\n[45:45] the integration registry. So instead\n[45:46] they publish their artifact, they\n[45:48] version it and then we integrate it. The\n[45:50] same for production. Um but I still want\n[45:53] to have the ability to go across\n[45:55] repositories and integrate without um\n[45:59] you know having to publish things. So\n[46:01] that's why I started to build this thing\n[46:03] called the grid which is around Terra\n[46:05] constructs. So Terra constructs has\n[46:07] already the capability of strongly\n[46:09] typing your outputs. So if you need to\n[46:11] integrate on things, you know exactly\n[46:12] what the shape will look like of what\n[46:14] you depend on. For example, if we have a\n[46:16] cluster, we we may have a VPC ID output.\n[46:20] We have subnets which is an array of\n[46:21] strings. We may have more more\n[46:23] complicated integration points, right?\n[46:25] Um but let me just let me just run the\n[46:28] API real quick. API surf\n[46:32] uh not server surf\n[46:38] binary.\n[46:38] >> Let's put it on the path. So now this\n[46:40] the the grid API is running and I will\n[46:42] go into the web app and run the the the\n[46:46] dashboard. It's a very basic dashboard.\n[46:50] >> Everything's a bit slow right now. I\n[46:51] don't know why. Okay. Maybe it's because\n[46:53] I have 100 different things open.\n[46:56] >> Yes, it's V hot moderator load. Vue.js,\n[46:59] right?\n[47:00] >> Uh no, this is React. [laughter] I don't\n[47:03] know anything about front end. Um so so\n[47:05] this was all written using specit using\n[47:08] uh specdriven development.\n[47:09] >> Holy moly.\n[47:10] >> And yeah and and some of the UI elements\n[47:13] originally bootstrapped by bolt. Uh but\n[47:15] then yeah so so this is basically the\n[47:18] grid when you are creating for example\n[47:20] the network which has a bunch of in this\n[47:22] case there are zero outputs because I\n[47:24] haven't really applied anything. Um but\n[47:26] then you have dependencies that define\n[47:28] for example the staging cluster depends\n[47:30] on the subnet ids from the network and\n[47:32] on the VPC ID from the network also the\n[47:35] staging database depends on the VPC ID\n[47:37] to provision into the network\n[47:39] >> right so we have these dependency\n[47:41] trackers and this is really the idea was\n[47:43] mainly from open taco right\n[47:45] >> why why are there two arrows going into\n[47:47] the cluster am I going\n[47:48] >> because multiple every output is tracked\n[47:51] individually\n[47:52] >> okay\n[47:53] >> okay I I can do a demo where I actually\n[47:55] apply things with Terraform so you can\n[47:57] see the colors change when things and\n[47:59] then you know why there's multiple\n[48:00] errors. This this is a a preset database\n[48:03] with some filtering. So I can\n[48:05] >> you know we we we need to do like a\n[48:07] visual\n[48:09] I think the theme for the next chat is a\n[48:11] visual infrastructure because I did want\n[48:13] to talk about uh Adam Jacobs uh oh my\n[48:17] god\n[48:19] what is this startup called? Help me\n[48:21] God.\n[48:22] >> Uh system initiative.\n[48:23] >> Yeah\n[48:24] >> I right\n[48:25] >> because I'm think I'm thinking system\n[48:27] initiative when I'm looking at this.\n[48:30] I'm not building uh what he call a\n[48:33] dynamic graph where every node has like\n[48:35] different their own um hooks on create,\n[48:39] read, update, delete. So it's a\n[48:40] programmable graph. That's what system.\n[48:42] >> Okay. Okay. So yours is more of like a\n[48:44] like a visualization type of\n[48:47] >> mine is a terraform state on um manager\n[48:52] and the idea is to integrate tightly\n[48:54] with terra constructs so that all of\n[48:56] these um all of these\n[48:59] points here are actually strongly typed.\n[49:01] So if I if I'm\n[49:04] you can see your level twos and things\n[49:06] like that in here.\n[49:08] >> Yeah, but I'm I'm using modules as an\n[49:09] encapsulation. So whatever the product\n[49:11] team they can be writing terapform\n[49:12] modules in here. Uh sorry I'm not using\n[49:14] modules in encapsulation. I'm using\n[49:16] states as an encapsulation. So the so in\n[49:18] my case the platform team is using the\n[49:20] AWS VPC module to provision the the\n[49:22] network and all.\n[49:23] >> Okay. Okay. State state state. Got it.\n[49:26] >> Yeah. And if they want to expose the VPC\n[49:28] and the subnet ids they should be able\n[49:30] to expose them as with the schema. So if\n[49:34] they're doing it using terra construct\n[49:35] the schema is attached to the L2s. So if\n[49:38] you you know you say to the L2 push your\n[49:40] outputs out to your state so you know\n[49:42] you make it available as a as a contract\n[49:44] to other teams then other teams when\n[49:47] they use Terra constructs they will read\n[49:48] that output and they get the schema with\n[49:50] it. So they know that this this output\n[49:53] has this shape because this is one of\n[49:54] the problems that I have when I was\n[49:55] using the integration registry, right? I\n[49:57] what are the parts that write things and\n[49:59] how do I find the keys that I need and\n[50:01] what is the shape of those keys? How do\n[50:03] I write them down? How do I read them\n[50:04] back out so that I get a strongly\n[50:06] versioned um feedback\n[50:07] >> contracts and stuff? Yeah.\n[50:09] >> Right. So let me let me uh do a database\n[50:13] reset\n[50:15] here. Um go back make DB reset.\n[50:21] It's going to delete the Postgress\n[50:23] volume and restart it.\n[50:24] >> Okay. Oh,\n[50:25] >> by the way, um why didn't you use SQL\n[50:27] light? You just\n[50:30] >> It's I'm using an ORM. Uh and it's using\n[50:32] the PG dialect if I want to use SQL. I'm\n[50:35] actually adding SQL light as a next\n[50:37] step.\n[50:38] >> Um\n[50:39] >> that's that's one that's the next\n[50:40] feature that speckit's going to be\n[50:41] working. Unsurprisingly, Claude is an\n[50:43] absolute demon with uh with SQL Light\n[50:47] because SQL Light has like no proper\n[50:49] golem times and types and stuff, right?\n[50:52] >> Um I don't really know. Couldn't\n[50:54] >> When you say demon, do you mean the\n[50:55] beast like really good at it or the\n[50:56] demon like chaotic?\n[50:58] >> No. No. I'm It's really good at it. Like\n[51:00] it able\n[51:01] >> I thought demon like like it's a devil.\n[51:04] >> No, I love it. it like it it was able to\n[51:07] create these like materialized views and\n[51:09] other optimizations to to make quite\n[51:11] complex views really simple to generate.\n[51:15] I mean it's so incredible really.\n[51:19] So I I will restart the grid API server\n[51:22] and I will restart the web app.\n[51:27] Okay. And now if I refresh there's\n[51:29] nothing in there, right? So now if I go\n[51:31] to the\n[51:34] >> by the way you can you can bootstrap\n[51:36] tasks in VS code if you have instead of\n[51:39] like\n[51:41] there. Yeah\n[51:42] >> it's it's just search VS code tasks\n[51:45] you'll find out how to do it.\n[51:46] >> Okay I'll need to do that. So I go into\n[51:49] the example Terraform. So here I have a\n[51:53] some setup and I should clear but I will\n[51:56] just create a network and um okay so I\n[51:59] go into the network I\n[52:02] I remove anything that's there. So right\n[52:04] now there's just the terraform\n[52:07] configuration which is\n[52:09] >> just um a null resource. It's not really\n[52:12] anything. It's not using AWS but it\n[52:14] simulates a VPC output with the ID of\n[52:16] the null resource and a subnet ID. It's\n[52:18] not the list. It's just an example.\n[52:20] >> Go to the top of the file. Why did you\n[52:22] Okay, so you just specify the provider.\n[52:24] Oh, actually\n[52:25] >> it's a single file. Okay.\n[52:26] >> Yeah, it's all it's all it's it's really\n[52:28] just a sample Terraform configuration\n[52:31] and I will use the grid uh control. So\n[52:34] this command line currently is just a\n[52:37] sample CLI implementation. For my\n[52:39] personal use, I'm going to use it to\n[52:41] integrate within our bootstrapping\n[52:42] because we have like a a Golang CLI to\n[52:44] bootstrap Terraform and so I'm going to\n[52:46] use it to automatically integrate with\n[52:48] the API. So the the CLI is just one\n[52:50] sample implementation that I include\n[52:52] with the monor repo but I have my own\n[52:55] that I I need to integrate it into. So\n[52:57] I'm using state create to create a new\n[52:59] state and I have to give it a logic ID.\n[53:01] So this is one of the first things in\n[53:03] terapform or in infrastructure a lot of\n[53:05] times names change. So maybe this could\n[53:08] be like the uh product a network or\n[53:11] something like that. But over time we\n[53:12] realize that actually product a network\n[53:14] should be shared and it should now\n[53:15] become shared network. So the logic ID\n[53:17] is decoupled under the hood. generates a\n[53:19] unique identity separately. The CLI uses\n[53:21] UID v7 but this is again the database\n[53:24] accepts whatever the client wants to use\n[53:26] >> that's actually uh a really good idea\n[53:28] because the minute we have to change our\n[53:30] TF state uh\n[53:32] >> it becomes a nightmare more so if you\n[53:33] use back end key uh I'm I'm always just\n[53:37] yeah I hate that\n[53:38] >> you need to do migrations then you need\n[53:40] to keep tracking where the other states\n[53:42] were that you depend on\n[53:43] >> yeah so I like this idea but I mean\n[53:45] you're only just using it to just keep\n[53:47] track of it you're not using it to help\n[53:48] manage\n[53:50] uh\n[53:52] what uh the logic ID yeah the logic ID\n[53:55] is is is a is a mutable attribute of the\n[53:57] state but it can be uh but it is\n[54:00] globally constrained as unique so across\n[54:01] the postress there's I mean\n[54:03] >> I I like the idea but like you're not\n[54:05] using it to actually store the state\n[54:06] you're just using it to keep track of it\n[54:08] of course\n[54:10] >> yeah uh yeah we're just we're just using\n[54:13] it to keep track of it as a unique\n[54:15] identifier\n[54:15] >> yeah it's a good idea\n[54:18] so at This point I have created by the\n[54:20] way I have not run terraform apply yet\n[54:22] but if I refresh and I will make this\n[54:24] like polling uh with like web workers\n[54:26] whatever but right now I just forced it\n[54:28] to be to this is one thing when you do\n[54:30] specd driven development it's really\n[54:32] important to scope things down and at\n[54:34] this point I thought like this might be\n[54:35] too complicated so I put it very\n[54:37] explicit put\n[54:38] >> I mean to be honest I'm I'm gang refresh\n[54:40] I don't like to uh to wait for things to\n[54:43] happen\n[54:44] >> automatically so now terapform init and\n[54:47] apply\n[54:48] will then\n[54:50] register the subnet ID and the VPC ID as\n[54:53] outputs in in the grid. Right? So this\n[54:56] this is running Terapform, right? I'm\n[54:57] not running anything else. This is\n[54:59] literally just Terraform talking to the\n[55:00] grid API and then grid API is extracting\n[55:03] the outputs and keeping track of them\n[55:04] okay separately. So if I do grid ctl\n[55:07] list\n[55:08] >> uh state list,\n[55:10] >> I can see it. I can also um I can see\n[55:12] it's clean because it's just been\n[55:14] applied. So if I go to my uh cluster\n[55:16] which needs to depend on the network,\n[55:18] let me remove every terapform file or\n[55:21] grid uh file that should be in there. So\n[55:23] it's only the no resources again that\n[55:26] are in here, right? And in this case the\n[55:28] cluster needs to read the network VPC\n[55:30] ID, right? It it depends on that. So I\n[55:33] can say grid ctl state create cluster u\n[55:36] logic ID, right? And then grit ctl u\n[55:39] deps add from network and it will bind\n[55:44] the outputs of the network and this is\n[55:46] where the type will be important right\n[55:48] but right now this is a non Terra\n[55:49] construct demo this is pure terapform no\n[55:52] typing yet right\n[55:53] >> so in this case I'm the the two the the\n[55:57] selection is a bit weird you need to\n[55:58] press enter I'm going to change that but\n[55:59] anyway um it was a default\n[56:01] >> generated by AI I can tell\n[56:04] >> yeah [laughter] I think it's a pterm\n[56:06] default so right now the network and the\n[56:08] cluster has a dependency and now you see\n[56:10] why these errors are separated because\n[56:12] you have two different outputs and they\n[56:14] may evolve separately. So the cluster\n[56:16] depends on the network.\n[56:17] >> Sorry, the yeah the cluster depends on\n[56:19] the network. If I do grid ctl state\n[56:22] list, I can see that the clust the the\n[56:25] cluster is stale because it has not been\n[56:27] applied. It has not been observed by the\n[56:28] grid API, right?\n[56:30] >> The grid ctl state in it again generates\n[56:34] the\n[56:34] >> the backend config for me.\n[56:37] >> But now comes the interesting part. I\n[56:38] can use grid ctl or whatever however I\n[56:40] integrate the SDK into my command line\n[56:42] or my Golang tooling to to in or to sync\n[56:46] the depths. So to sync the depths means\n[56:49] it's going to generate the remote state\n[56:51] lookup for the network using that unique\n[56:52] identity and then pre-generating the\n[56:54] network locals for me. So I know that\n[56:56] there's a subnet ID. Again, this is\n[56:58] because I declare that this state needs\n[57:00] those two outputs. So it's going to\n[57:02] generate\n[57:03] >> you're using the data is using the grid\n[57:06] backend to grab the to make the link.\n[57:10] Okay. You so you're not relying on the\n[57:12] file system.\n[57:13] >> So I have yeah no no file system. So I\n[57:16] can go across repositories right. So\n[57:18] this is an API server which is our think\n[57:21] you can pretty much do this with space\n[57:23] lift. You can do this with Terraform\n[57:25] cloud for sure.\n[57:27] >> This is something I think would be\n[57:28] incredibly fun to deploy in my\n[57:30] workplace. So I mean do you have a\n[57:32] standalone binary which I can start\n[57:34] running and linking up uh different uh\n[57:37] state files and and drawing a graph? I\n[57:40] think that has a lot of value actually.\n[57:42] It has a lot of value. This is going to\n[57:43] be Apache to open source. I want to open\n[57:45] source this once I've got the type\n[57:47] schema integration with Terra construct.\n[57:49] I it's right now it's in GitHub private\n[57:51] repo. I can give you access. Um I'm not\n[57:54] sure about open sourcing it because it's\n[57:56] very I mean at this point it's similar\n[57:58] to open taco. I have to be honest. I I I\n[58:01] talked to the Open Taco people. I\n[58:03] understood how they use it.\n[58:05] >> It's not Open Taco, it's the [laughter]\n[58:07] grid. Um they're they're doing great\n[58:10] work with Open Taco by the way. I look\n[58:12] on the pull requests, they are adding a\n[58:13] lot of features. They added SQL light\n[58:15] already and and they they're using\n[58:17] Lightream. I I think that's what\n[58:19] >> So they they bas So so there's a lot of\n[58:21] overlap what you're doing in open\n[58:22] typing.\n[58:23] >> There's a lot of overlap except I want\n[58:24] type schemas and they're not talking to\n[58:26] me. [laughter]\n[58:28] So, I'm like, like I said, I told them\n[58:30] that I could oneshot this in cloud, so I\n[58:32] took 10 days to oneshot this in cloud.\n[58:34] [laughter]\n[58:36] >> Oh, man. I'm loving the innovation here.\n[58:37] I'm loving it. Um, yeah, I mean, I I I\n[58:42] definitely would love to to to have this\n[58:45] visualization on on some state files.\n[58:48] Um, but I don't I'm just playing I'm\n[58:50] just playing devil's advocate here,\n[58:51] Vince. I just I I I see myself\n[58:54] >> u enjoying like a visualization\n[58:57] >> but not the type schema.\n[58:58] >> But uh but even the type schema that\n[59:01] could help me uh to do some bugs or\n[59:04] something like that. Um, I mean that's\n[59:06] the way that's the way I see typing is\n[59:08] like helping me figure out where there's\n[59:11] issues\n[59:14] >> uh like I I would see it as a\n[59:16] visualization but like but that's that's\n[59:19] a hard that's a hard sell as a as a\n[59:22] product like you know like it's\n[59:24] >> I'm not selling it like I'm I'm so my\n[59:26] main goal here is um to basically make\n[59:29] something available that I can use\n[59:30] myself. Also the way I designed it, I I\n[59:33] make the package the SDK is a strongly\n[59:36] type Golang and because I'm using\n[59:38] connect RPC, I also created TypeScript\n[59:40] package because that's what I use in my\n[59:41] dashboard in my web app. So in my web\n[59:43] app, I'm actually using the um the grit\n[59:48] um where is it the grid? Where is the\n[59:50] grid tacons? Here I'm using the TCON. Um\n[59:54] I'm autogenerating the clients in\n[59:56] Typescript and in Golang. Uh it could be\n[59:59] Java, whatever because it's using\n[1:00:01] connect RPC. Uh al although I do need to\n[1:00:04] wrap it because connect RPC handlers are\n[1:00:06] pretty horrible. And anyway, what I want\n[1:00:09] is to basically use this one in my\n[1:00:12] library to\n[1:00:13] >> interact grid. It's some third party.\n[1:00:16] What is that?\n[1:00:17] >> No, that's my workspace. So that's my TS\n[1:00:19] SDK, right? It's autogenerated from from\n[1:00:22] the protobuff definitions and then a\n[1:00:25] little\n[1:00:25] >> tons\n[1:00:27] constructs. Oh,\n[1:00:29] >> it's all my project, baby. [laughter]\n[1:00:32] >> Okay. Okay. I'm a little bit slow. No,\n[1:00:34] but it looks I I definitely see the\n[1:00:36] value in that. I really would like to\n[1:00:37] try that out, actually.\n[1:00:39] >> Yeah. So, how it differs from open taco\n[1:00:42] is they're focused on like you can\n[1:00:44] control the grid using the Terraform\n[1:00:45] provider. My goal is I'm giving you an\n[1:00:48] SDK. I can generate the terapform\n[1:00:50] provider from the SDK. I can generate um\n[1:00:53] JavaScript integrations with the grid\n[1:00:55] which is what I'm doing for my project\n[1:00:57] because I want you know and I want\n[1:00:58] additional endpoints control. I want to\n[1:01:00] control what is it that you can attach\n[1:01:02] to a state. I want to be able or to the\n[1:01:04] dependencies the outputs itself. That's\n[1:01:06] what I want to control. So um so I'm\n[1:01:08] doing this currently with with specit\n[1:01:11] and I'm telling you this like 14 days\n[1:01:13] now and I've been able to bootstrap the\n[1:01:16] repo, build the state dependency logic,\n[1:01:19] add some CLI improvements, wire up the\n[1:01:21] dashboard um and now I'm working on\n[1:01:24] authentication and authorization. So\n[1:01:26] OIDC integration\n[1:01:27] >> actually I'm curious what it ends up\n[1:01:29] doing there. I was think in a web app or\n[1:01:33] whatever app is always interesting. So\n[1:01:35] my prompt was very very dumb. Um and it\n[1:01:39] took me I think the last [clears throat]\n[1:01:41] eight hours to\n[1:01:43] >> I want to out because no tech right\n[1:01:45] you're not supposed to say the tech. So\n[1:01:46] it's like I need to add authentication\n[1:01:48] authorization and arbback control. I\n[1:01:50] want to um basically protect both the\n[1:01:54] control plane. Well actually somebody\n[1:01:56] else onem I think I think again go codex\n[1:02:00] doesn't doesn't give a Codex just\n[1:02:01] went and changed my prompt cuz I didn't\n[1:02:03] give it that prompt. I gave it a much\n[1:02:05] simpler prompt and Codex went like\n[1:02:06] actually the user is doing a lot more\n[1:02:08] and he's like we have a control plane\n[1:02:10] which is our grid API and then we have\n[1:02:12] the data plane which is the terraform\n[1:02:13] interacting with the terapform state. So\n[1:02:15] both of them need to be covered by\n[1:02:16] authorization and I need to expose like\n[1:02:18] the authentication token to the\n[1:02:20] terraform process so that it can\n[1:02:21] actually run the apply. So it's very\n[1:02:23] interesting. Uh I think I've nailed the\n[1:02:25] tasks now. I'm pretty sure I can get\n[1:02:28] this like authentication. Well, I'll be\n[1:02:31] interested because I think this one\n[1:02:32] might be one that it might trip on up\n[1:02:35] on, but uh cool.\n[1:02:37] >> Hey,\n[1:02:37] >> I'll let you know. Hey,\n[1:02:39] >> that was awesome, Vincent. Oh, one more\n[1:02:40] thing. Just one more thing.\n[1:02:41] >> So, so I just ran the apply, right? So,\n[1:02:44] right now it shows that it has conf\n[1:02:47] consumed and they are clean.\n[1:02:49] >> Now, what happens when the network\n[1:02:50] changes? Like that happens all the time,\n[1:02:52] right? People recreate network.\n[1:02:54] >> Why did you say clean and and and stale?\n[1:02:56] I mean, that's doesn't seem like the the\n[1:02:59] right terminology. I mean, with drift\n[1:03:01] with drift detection in terraform, it's\n[1:03:05] they do they say stale and clean? I've\n[1:03:07] gone\n[1:03:07] >> I have no idea. I just\n[1:03:09] >> Okay, you just made them up. Okay,\n[1:03:10] whatever.\n[1:03:11] >> Yeah.\n[1:03:11] >> So, there's a thing here with the\n[1:03:13] network. For some reason, every time you\n[1:03:15] apply uh a time stamp forces the VPC to\n[1:03:18] be recreated.\n[1:03:19] >> Very convenient.\n[1:03:22] So at this point this one has changed\n[1:03:24] and recreated the output. And if I\n[1:03:26] refresh now we see that the subnets are\n[1:03:28] the same but the VPCS. Well, this is not\n[1:03:30] realistic example, right? But that's why\n[1:03:33] >> it's interesting because it flags um a\n[1:03:36] typical problem, right?\n[1:03:38] >> Yes. So this is one of the problems of\n[1:03:39] the integration registry, right? Where\n[1:03:41] we're not able to keep track of like who\n[1:03:43] lost the value. This is actually 100%\n[1:03:46] open taco because they have an in digest\n[1:03:48] and an out digest on the edge when the\n[1:03:50] when you dry these edges. So whenever a\n[1:03:53] state files get written it keep captures\n[1:03:56] the outputs and writes out the out\n[1:03:58] digest and all the other states whenever\n[1:04:00] they apply they they they um observe the\n[1:04:05] incoming outputs and they write out\n[1:04:07] their indigest. So, whenever the\n[1:04:08] indigest and the out digest differs,\n[1:04:10] that's when an arrow is no longer um\n[1:04:14] clean, basically.\n[1:04:15] >> I don't quite understand, but I'll have\n[1:04:17] to try it, I guess.\n[1:04:18] >> Yeah, never mind. Like,\n[1:04:20] >> okay, so time time out, man. My brain is\n[1:04:21] about to turn to to mush.\n[1:04:23] >> That's it. That's it, really. Um\n[1:04:25] >> thanks, Vincent. And if if anyone got\n[1:04:29] this far, I I really applaud you. You\n[1:04:31] >> look I think we're gonna cut this.\n[1:04:34] I drive for 4 hours to work uh because I\n[1:04:37] work in London. So I I don't mind long\n[1:04:39] form content to be honest. It's better\n[1:04:41] than listening to like hey,\n[1:04:44] you know, I kind of\n[1:04:45] >> I think you will look Ah, you mean like\n[1:04:47] last time when I cut it, it was too\n[1:04:48] much.\n[1:04:49] >> No, no, I think I think I think I think\n[1:04:51] you do what what I would do. You mean\n[1:04:53] you cut it pretty well for the first\n[1:04:55] third, but the two the last two/3s you\n[1:04:56] didn't cut it.\n[1:05:00] I mean, that was my impression. Maybe\n[1:05:02] you cut it so well I didn't even notice.\n[1:05:05] >> Uh, I don't remember. But I do try to.\n[1:05:08] >> This is two hours of content. It's It's\n[1:05:11] going to be so hard to cut it. But if\n[1:05:12] you want to cut it, you do you, Vincent.\n[1:05:16] >> You don't know me. I I record myself\n[1:05:18] using Speckit for four hours and I cut\n[1:05:20] it down into like a 30 minute like to\n[1:05:22] the interesting section.\n[1:05:24] >> I do.\n[1:05:25] >> So you're uploading videos of you using\n[1:05:26] Speckit already. I have loom I share\n[1:05:29] with my colleagues or with my friends\n[1:05:31] and then I see nobody watch it.\n[1:05:32] >> Come on, [laughter] get a YouTube\n[1:05:34] channel. Get a YouTube channel.\n[1:05:36] >> Someone will watch. I don't know who you\n[1:05:38] are, but thank you.\n[1:05:41] >> Okay, see you.\n[1:05:42] >> I don't know how am I going to get this.\n[1:05:43] Yeah. See you. Have a lunch or whatever.\n[1:05:46] >> Yeah. Bye. You too. Cheers. Good night.",

Just\nbecause you bought a place, I suppose,\njust like I moved to\n>> No, no. I I I came to Vietnam in 2006\nand um I worked 10 years as a\nprofessional services\num consultant implementing ERP systems\nlike financial management system called\ninfor systems. And so that was mostly\nwith international clients. So I was\nbased out of Vietnam but I would be\ntraveling all the time. And my\nbackground is software engineering, but\num I spent 10 years training people on\nhow to enter invoices into an accounting\nsystem without knowing anything about\naccounting initially. Um, so that was\nlike and that's kind of where I learned\nthat you really only understand\nsomething if you\num if you can explain it to someone else\nbut also you get a very different\nperspective from other people cuz they\nput me in front of like manuals of this\naccounting system and they said okay in\none month you're going to the customer\nyou're going to shadow a senior first\nand then later you're going to have to\ndo the trainings on your own.\n>> So you're training like Vietnamese?\n>> No, no, no. International. So I was\nbased out of Vietnam, but um the company\nI worked for had a very big contract\nwith Hilton Hotels Worldwide. So I went\nmostly to Hilton hotels like Gardening\nor\n>> Are you allowed to say these people's\nnames\nor do I have to retract?\n>> No, it's fine. [laughter] I worked 10\nyears um for\npretty much mainly on Hilton and some\nother hospitality clients.\n>> All right. But yeah, I mean it's it's\nnot a secret.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Then how did you get into infrastructure\nthen? How did you become a Kubern I mean\nI think I knew you back in Singapore as\na Kubernetes um zealot,\n>> right?\n>> Made me absolutely made which made me\nwant to push you away because I I I I\njust had bad experience after bad\nexperience with with Kubernetes. I mean\nI use community don't get me wrong and\nwhen it when it's appropriate but uh it\nit does frustrate me.\n>> Yeah. So after about you know 7 years of\ngoing to customers. So from 2006 until\n2013 about um most of the time I would\nyou know we would we would be there to a\nwhole day to install a Windows systems\nyou know we would be having a word\ndocument and we would have our\ninstallation you know with the\nrequirements for the client because\nevery\ncustomer we work with they have\ndifferent requirements. if they are a\nreal estate investment fund in\nLuxembourg, they have different security\nrequirements than the hospitality like\nthe way that they manage the servers,\nthe way that you get access to a server.\nAnd I also worked for Gadak Cement which\nis a whole wholesim subsidiary in\nAzarban and I worked and always had to\nlike follow these manual like\ninstallation steps from a word document\nand I wrote a lot of PowerShell scripts\nto kind of like automate that process,\nyou know. I had a lot of fun with with\nlike um active is it ADO active objects\nfrom Microsoft uh inn net. So so with\nPowerShell you actually have like the\nwhole net. So you could create any\nobject that the Windows system had and I\ncould load like uh access database\nfiles. So some of this software that I\nworked with used access databases. So I\ncould use PowerShell to load the access\ndatabase, read some of the data, modify\nit. So I started making\n>> back now. Gosh, you you must be as old\nas I am.\n>> Yeah. So, so that was a lot of fun like\nbecause we had a lot of bash scripts and\nstuff that other consultants had built.\nUm but yeah, I mean we as we do the same\nthing a lot. So we try to optimize our\nwork, right? So, so we have some\ninternal scripts that we have and um\nthat's part of our professional services\nour our um you know expertise that we\nbring to to to okay supply the system\nright so I I actually spent a lot of\ntime building unattended install scripts\nwith powershell\n>> uh and it wasn't once I saw one customer\nwhich was kadak cementin they had the\nwhole VMware that was back in 201 I\ndon't know 2011 maybe before that VMware\nwas already spread quite in a lot of\nplaces, but\n>> I was working on like preparing a\ntraining session and I had everything\nset up on my virtual machine, but then I\nhad to copy over the settings to the the\nactual client server for um for an a\ntraining session and I said, \"Oh no, um\nI ran out of time and one of the IT\nadministrators says, \"You have you're\nrunning VMware.\nUm what's your IP address? let me clone\nthe VM machine from your laptop and I'll\ncreate four copies for every attendee.\nYeah. And I was like what the hell?\n[laughter]\nSo, so you know after you know spending\nall this time you know creating\nscreenshots so we have a document we we\nwe take screenshots of what we have\nactually done on their machine and then\nyou know hand over to the IT\nadministrator. um you know after doing\nthat flow in many um you know for many\ncustomers I come to this place and\nthey're like let me you know let me\nconnect to your laptop to the VMware\nport and copy the VM. I was like, uh,\nokay, what the hell? At that point, I\nkind of realized that all of this\nWindows manual process is kind of\nnonsense. And I started looking also I\nwanted to run game servers. And I\nlearned I I had like we we bought like a\nPower Edge Dell server that we wanted to\nput in a data center like a colo in in\nVietnam with a friend to run games on\nit. And he needed Windows.\n>> Yeah. I wanted Counter Strike uh you\nCS:GO at the time,\n>> right around 2013. And um at the time he\nneeded Windows for he he ran a big\ngaming uh news website iame.vietnam in\nVietnam and um he needed he wanted to\nhost an up andcoming game but it was\nWindows only. So I ran my my we needed\nto run VMs right Windows and um and\nLinux and so then I also wanted to have\nbetter performance because as soon as\nyou run Counter Strike in the VM you\nstart having performance problems. So I\nstarted to play with like Linux\ncontainers uh and Docker at the time and\nthat's how I got into Docker originally\nand I started going to to uh meetups in\nin Vietnam to learn about like I want to\ningest because I wanted to get create a\ngaming platform for Counterstrike that\nwas like ESL existed, HLTV existed.\nThose are very big like Counterstrike\nrelated related services and I felt that\nthey did not give a lot of like\nstatistics. There was um fragbite sorry\nnot fragbite got frag in America they\ngave oh and esa they had very detailed\nstatistics uh like about your\ncontribution to a round they calculated\nso they could assign skill points to a\nplayer much better than most of the\nother platforms. Yeah. So I was like I\nhad built gaming I had run gaming\ntournaments in in Belgium. So I knew how\nto get all of the logs so you could get\nevery single event from the locks. So\nyou could tell the the Counter-Strike\nserver to send all the locks to you. And\nI was used to like\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I was used basically at the time\nyou used like like IRC bots, you know,\nyou say a certain keyword and that\nmessage was received and the bot would\nwould um identify with a regular\nexpression or whatever or just look if\nthe if the text starts with a certain\nkeyword and then it would execute\ncommands. So people would say things and\nif it had that command then the bot\nwould respond. So, we had like a bot\nthat would read the Counter Strike logs\nand then would keep track of the score\nuh and then keep track of like when it\nneeds to restart or switch the teams so\nthey could, you know, manage a\ntournament. So, I was like, cool, I just\nneed to ingest all of the the statistics\nabout the players. So, I wanted to build\nlike a platform and I I learned Angular\nand NodeJS and Python and try to build\nthis on my own at the same time, you\nknow, as a side project. And I I then\nreally got into Docker and and and go to\nmeetup. So I I got into the Docker\nmeetups and and then\n>> Yeah, that's cool. Like a lot I mean I I\nbasically got into this into this game\nthrough gaming and I think that's a very\ncommon uh\n>> what do you call it? Origin story for a\nlot of people in this business.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Servers to infrastructure engineers.\n>> Yes. And also um going to the meetups\ngave you a lot of like insights um into\nwhat other people were doing and allowed\nyou to talk to people and figure out\nlike even though I was at my day job I\nwas working for 10 years with like these\njust financial accounting systems and\nbuilding you know nets power and\npowershell scripts and and things like\nthat and then now I was like learning\nbash python docker like immutable\nservers and and and So that was like\nreally exciting and interesting you know\num but\n>> but then you then you got into\nKubernetes hard.\n>> Yeah. So one of the meetups that was\naround 2014 after the Google people had\nannounced Kubernetes as a project uh at\nthe Docker Con. Um it looked way\noverkill like initially when I looked at\nwhat they talked about the cublet that\nwas interesting. Yeah. you could run\nthat separately to get like information\nabout your docker demon and the\ncontainers on your host. So that was\nlike yeah maybe I like the cublet but I\ndon't like this everything else right\nand then\n>> the control plane is quite good isn't it\nlike\n>> it was absolutely crazy in the beta. So\nback in 2014 uh I think around September\nthey they went from beta to like sta\nstable v1 um around September. So they\nhad announced it in July and it looked\nreally complicated and at the time I was\nusing digital ocean because I didn't\nknow AWS and I wanted like simple VPS,\nright? A a droplet cost like $5 a month\n>> and it was great for a hobby, right?\n>> Ocean was great, wasn't it? It was so\neasy.\n>> Yeah. And and but they had also um an a\nbounty like if you if you propose an\narticle and they approved it, then they\nwould give you like $30 credit to run.\n>> Oh. and and write the article for them\nand their ex\n>> sorry\n>> that was a brilliant idea to get people\nengaged. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So to to basically create a huge\nknowledge base and to have the community\nbuild a lot of interesting use cases on\ntop of digital ocean and there was an\narticle from a guy who worked at digital\nocean I think about setting up\nKubernetes on digital ocean droplets but\nit was like you originally kubernetes\nwas all bash shell scripts like you had\nto run this script to to build this and\nthat. I mean it was horrible\ninstallation mechanism and then Kelsey\nHigh Tower had written this um guide for\ncore OS. So I was using coros a lot\nwhich is like\n>> yeah o really good\n>> everything is is through systemd unit.\nSo it was all systemd and then they\nbuilt their their fleet\n>> on top of system.\n>> I love the upgrade mechanism where where\n>> yeah so they have dual boot and they had\nlike a locksmith um to basic and was was\nfrom coros right they used to to track\num the whole fleet when one acquired the\nlock to reboot into the second\npartition. They also used the idea of\nchannels. So if you are running on a\ncertain version of chores and you're\nsubscribed to like the stable channel\nand a new version is available, it would\nyou know behind the scenes download the\nsecond uh the new version on a second\npartition and then it would\n>> I think that came\nOS\n>> slight slight little ch tangent before\nChrome OS I had my startup web converger\nwhich had an update mechanism which I\nthought was quite novel I still think\nit's novel and that was based on git. So\nbasically the whole root of the the OS\nis checked into git and then the idea is\nthat it once it's running you do a git\npull and that's how it gets the sort of\nlike deltas and then on reboot it checks\nout the new um updates. Um, so I was\nquite and I'm still am quite uh well uh\nboasting well boasting or promoting my\nmethod over the Chrome OS one because I\nstill think the Chrome OS one is a\nlittle bit overkill but anyway,\n>> right? Um so so the cool thing was I\nreally loved Coros and Kelsey was\nworking at Coros and had this very nice\nguide on how to set up a Kubernetes\nfleet using Coros. Um but he had only\nexamples for AWS and at the time maybe\neven Google Cloud. was before he he\njoined Google and those guides were like\nfirst you have to create your your uh\nyour private key infrastructure your PKI\n>> Kubernetes is the hard way that's how it\nstarts I believe\n>> well it was the hard way before the hard\nway was a thing [laughter] so I I wrote\nthis this guide for for digital ocean\nwhich was massive you know it started by\nyou know bootstrapping your PII with\nselfert like self-signed certificate\nauthority generating different client\nkeys for the SC CD client setting up\nflannel you know and I I did a full deep\ndive into like how does\n>> I've forgotten it sounds\n>> flannel was a core o um pxlan packet\nencapsulation system so it's basically\nto create the overlay network right um\nwhen kubernetes that's one of the great\nthings about kubernetes right every\ncontainer within the fleet must talk to\nmust be able to talk to other containers\nthat may be running on different\nmachines so they create this overlay\nnetwork on top of the underlaying cloud\nnetwork. So you create like maybe three\ncore o droplets and then you create a\nbunch of flannel um demons that keep\ntrack of the range of IP addresses\ncontainers within their host can have\nand then flannel whenever a network\npacket comes in encapsulates it that\nnetwork packet on the overlay network\nencapsulate it in the underlay network\nto then send it to the right node and\nthen that decapsulated and then send it\nokay the source is this container. So,\nso Flannel was a very basic one you\nbacked by CD and then um kind of merged\nwith Calico because Kalico added\nadditional ways of encapsulation that um\nwere less like latency in introduced\nless latency. So, so it was super\ninteresting. I mean all of these tools\ncame out of Coros um and actually this\nwas after somebody within the Docker\nmeetup had asked like hey you know this\nKubernetes thing does somebody want to\nlook at it and I had and and it was\naround the V1 release. So a lot of these\nstuff was um you know getting\nstabilized. Uh so there were less bash\nscripts to download all the all the\nbinaries. You actually had proper Golang\nbinaries that you could download from\nthe releases. And so I was able to to\ntalk about it like watching Brandon\nBurns and Kelsey High Tower talk about\nKubernetes and seeing the live demo of\nKelsey High Tower where he just you know\ntriggers uh a replica set. I think it\nwas later that they introduced\ndeployments. Originally it was um\nreplication\nuh it was not replica set it was like\nreplica controller\num but it was very confusing because the\nname of the object was called like a\nreplication controller where you give it\nthe number of pots you want to run uh\nbut then in real in reality the\ncontroller is something that runs inside\nthe AP inside the control plane that\nthat looks at the request and the actual\nobject is the replica set is how many\nyou want to run of them right so then\nthey renamed it on v 1.1 or 1.2 and they\nintroduced a thing called the deployment\nto basically control the rollover\nmechanism like how do you want to roll\nout between different replica sets. Uh\nso that was all introduced around the\ntime that I went to for Asia in in\nSingapore uh and do a presentation about\nKubernetes there. So I was talking about\nthis amazing, you know, mechanism of\nreplication controllers and then they\nchanged it all to replica sets and I was\nlike I'm very confused about this new\nstuff.\n>> I was a little bit puzzled about replica\nsets myself because because ultimately\n>> it seemed attached to to how you would\nwant to scale your app because because\nif you have too many replicas then you\nyou're going to maybe take too many too\nmany uh CPU or whatever RAM resources.\nAnd I thought\n>> everything it changed so much\n>> like how like if I'm running my app how\nmany replicas do I need? Do I need two\nthree four five 10? Do I do I do it to\nto maximize the resour so\n>> like I I never\n>> when I'm talking about 2014 15 all of\nthat was like very basic. Um today you\nwould obviously use like autoscaling you\nwould um even you have vertical\nautoscaling now you can resize pods\nwithout restarting them. Those are all\nthings that you can do stable because\nlike I just\nit is\n>> because because a few years ago I just\nthought I I just don't trust this\nautoscaler but um but yeah may maybe I'm\n>> so so that that's how I got into it\nright I mean initially I was doing coros\nfor my friend startup um and every time\nthe droplet every time cor updated\nnobody has access anymore because\n[laughter] I was maintaining their SSH\nkeys separately\n>> what was relation ship between core o\nand kubernetes because coros came out of\ndocker didn't it? No what did it\n>> no coros is a was a company um that was\nalso called coros and they had an um\nthey had an operating system called\ncoros which was a container centric\noperating system. So you would run even\nyour debug tools you would run\neverything through contra containers and\nthe actual it was kind of like a\nprecursor to Talos uh today I think\n>> um that idea of like using docker images\nto like I don't know um get your basic\nbash or something well I mean bash is\nnot a good example but like your tooling\nyeah\n>> yeah and and chores originally they they\nhad their own scheduler right um that\nthey built separate from kubernetes\nwhich was fleet and fleet\nThey basically extended the idea of a\nsystemd unit to um to something that you\ncould run across multiple nodes and you\nhad some scheduling constraints on the\nsystemd unit. I forgot the name of it\nthat uh it was a set of units or\nsomething like that. Uh but as\nKubernetes became more popular they\ndeprecated their own fleet and they\nstarted they adopted um Kubernetes and\nthen they built their own flavor of it\ncalled tectonic.\n>> The Kubernetes is system D3. Um, so it\nfeels like systemd went head-to-head\nwith Kubernetes and Kubernetes one,\nright?\n>> M, not really. I mean, systemd was the\nway to run like was replacing your\nupstart and your init systems on the\noperating system, right? And Redhead\nmade it the default and a lot of uh\ndistributions like rejected it, but then\nUbuntu adopted it and then everyone\nfollowed.\n>> Uses a different well c what what's the\nname of the control plan? cublet or\nwhatever to\n>> uh no kubernetes completely decoupled\nfrom it like systemd was purely your\ninit system on your operating on your\n>> how does kubernetes managed the pods and\n>> well that's the container runtime\n>> right\n>> so the container runtime interface so\noriginally a lot of them use docker to\nto use to basically like pull the\ncontainer image set up the file system\nlaunch the process within the cont like\nthe name spaces and the control groups\nset everything up for you, right? Um,\nand then over time there was this uh\nsplit between Docker and Coros because\num Docker was moving fast and breaking\nthings and so Red Hat froze the Docker\nversions and then Coros created a new\nproject called Rocket which is using\nsystemdspawn.\n>> Yeah, systemdspawn. Yes.\n>> And that was like Leonard uh was it name\nLeonard like pit one\n>> butering. Yeah, he he he basically said\nhe came to Singapore as well talked\nabout like systemd and spawn is how I\ndebug. Yeah, systemdspawn is how I debug\num kernels. So I use systemdnspawn all\ntime. It's a very solid product and then\nCororo built rocket on top of it and\nthey added um the good thing about this\ncompetition was that they said like okay\nDocker is using very insecure uh like\nthey didn't have proper verification of\nthe images and and so Koro said we need\nto focus on that and Docker was like\nthat's not our priority our priority is\ndeveloper experience and Coro says okay\nwe're building systemdspawn and we're\nadding this GPG based signing of images\nand and layer like image layer\nverification like basically what\nenterprises need for security and the\nresponse of docker was there well you're\nusing gpg is so old we use tuf like the\nupdate framework and we are using like a\nnotary for signing layers and and they\nthey came up with like a new completely\nnew tool set I think docker at the time\nhad a lot of money as well a lot of VC\ninvestments and so they docker was like\nthis one company and and Solomon hike\nwas like fighting super hard against\nthese giants Google redhead and and\nothers and And um\n>> yeah, they had their own and whatever.\n>> Yeah. So when when they did a Docker con\nthat year that um Cor and Stroet, they\nmade an exposition about like um the the\nwhale at the start of the conference.\nThey did something. I only watched\neverything on Twitter. I I never went to\nany of these events, but I saw on\nTwitter that they had like this this\nopening of the conference and the rocket\nlaunch failed. And hint hint, rocket\nfailed. Like [laughter] they would do\nthese things all the time. Oh man, we\ncan I'm just conscious we this is\nsupposed to be the intro for your grid\num app.\n>> Oh my god. This is going to be a video\nonto itself almost\n>> but like\n>> No, no, no. Yeah, just a background.\n>> Why did core OS fail actually?\n>> It didn't fail. It was acquired by\nRedhead.\n>> Okay. Well, they did I mean it did fail\nin my book because it did seem to go out\nof the view that it seems to have lost\nminds. I think the biggest problem was\nthey had built tectonic which was like a\nterraform based kubernetes flavor. So\nthey had their own um boot system. So\nthey had like this um cloud init\nextension called I forgot ignition. They\nhad this ignition u it's like user data\non steroids uh for pixie booting on on\non networks like your coros and so on.\nIt was amazing like I never ran cor OS\non on LAN but they they were focused on\nlike enterprise customers not\nnecessarily running in the cloud and\nTectonic was all Terraform with like\nignition provider and the problem was\nTectonic was really expensive like the\nlicense to run Tectonic like you could\nrun it for free but you wouldn't get\nsome of the like SSO and other\nenterprise features so originally\nTectonic\n>> was their their commercial offering What\nis the link with Terraform? You you you\nwould use Terraform to provision it or\nsomething or\n>> Yeah. So they they had the like Tectonic\nwas basically a whole bunch of Terraform\npackaged up with Kubernetes bootstrap\nwith ignition with on top of core OS. So\nit would give you a fleet of coros um\nnodes and it would bootstrap CD and the\ncontrol plane for Kubernetes and it\nwould bootstrap every node to join the\ncluster properly and all that. So\ntectonic on top of that it was a bit\nlike open shift right. So, so at the\ntime a lot of these kubernetes\ndistributions came out like open shift\num from ranch like there was wrencher\nand there was also from fedora or susi\nlinux they had also their own flavor and\npretty much everyone was launching their\nkubernetes flavor\n>> um and before the clouds launched them\nlike Google had\n>> I think had nothing\n>> yeah I did not like it\n>> it was I mean it's the same thing with\nlike I I So my background's always been\nvery operational.\n>> Sorry,\n>> it was the most minimal one. I think\nthat's why I was attracted to\n>> it was the most like easy one like\ndocker compos like the reason developers\nlike to run docker compose is because\nit's easy almost no dials and knobs same\nlike wrencher you would just run it it\nwould just run it would spin up\neverything and it would just run and I\nhated that because I I was deep into\nlike spinning up my CD my own\ncertificates my own you know user data\nat that time. So, so, so the thing is I,\nyou know, you start digging in really\ndeep and then as you are, you know, I\nwasn't working at a company that was\nlike having real needs. I I wasn't\nworking at any company using Kubernetes,\nright? So, for I was doing this all for\nfun. So, all of this stuff that took\naway my fun like rancher that was no\ngood. I wanted to do it myself. So I\nremember very early somebody asked like\nI was talking about running a mail\nserver on the on on on digital ocean\nlotion and somebody said why wouldn't\nyou just use AWS and I was like oh you\nknow why would I pay all of this extra\nmoney [laughter] I can do it myself and\nthen of course you you get called\n>> Yeah. No and then you get called in\nthese problems um because my friend\nstartup he's trying to send emails and\nthen they go into like the they go into\n>> Yeah. they go in quarantine and then\nhe's like, \"Oh, Vincent, what is this?\nLike our our spam house uh reputation is\nbad and and then it's because you're\nusing digital ocean IPs and they are\nobviously like blacklisted in spam house\nand so then you start to get all of\nthese issues and also you know once I\ngot all of the Kubernetes figured out\nand I could [clears throat] do cluster\nupgrades easily and all of that and then\nyou don't want to bother with it anymore\nafter a while like that's done. you've\nyou've played enough with it and now you\nwant to just focus on deploying things\non top of it. So it took a while to get\nto that stage and also when you're in a\ncompany and you have to deliver a\nbusiness value and not just spin up\nclusters\n>> then you start to say actually you know\nI can use\n>> in your current role are you still a\nKubernetes u uh monkey or whatever the\nterm is for\n>> uh so my last role that I use Kubernetes\nwas like two years ago.\n>> Okay. So now you've like gone\nterraformish. Well, you got CDK or\n>> Yeah. Um\nI I really was interested about CDK. I\njust never had the opportunity to play\nwith it, right?\n>> Um so so I got into\n>> an organization that used CDK and then\num I saw the benefits of it and and then\nalso I worked with I worked plenty of\ntimes that I trained people how to use\nKubernetes. And when you use something\nlike ECS and you have something like CDK\nthat can create container definitions or\nFargate backed uh you know just define\nmy workload it's so much easier to to\nwork with than if you have to like you\nknow define everything with Argo CD and\nGitHubs and and endless lines of YAML\nand and so again it's one of those\nthings that's very interesting for a\nwhile and then once you've done it you\nget really bored of it [laughter]\nyou know initially.\n>> Well I mean yeah like I think I\nempathize with you. I I we we we're all\nexposed to these these technologies. Um\nand and we as you should and like Yeah.\nI know about Kubernetes, I know about\nTerraform, I know about CDK. The more we\nknow the better we are really. It's not\nlike I do find it weird when\n>> the more we understand the trade-offs as\nwell.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because that's a problem. Like we don't\nreally know the trade-offs. If we only\nknow one tool, we think this is the best\ntool ever until we start using other\n>> tools. When people try to sell\nthemselves as as a Kubernetes\ninfrastructure engineer, like why don't\nyou learn learn other things, a dude?\n>> But the good thing is though, like I use\nFargate a lot at work now. And there's\nseveral cases where we're like, oh, we\nneed to do this thing or that thing. And\nI'm like, well, that that would just be\nan ingress manifest on Kubernetes and\nthat would just be like something like a\nservice mesh or like an\n>> trade-offs, the comparisons. That's very\n>> you very quickly like find the\nlimitations where you're like well in\nKubernetes I would have I would control\nmy my service mesh or my uh overlay\nnetwork. Uh for example one issue that\nwe had is we wanted to save cost and use\nlike memory swappiness and like be able\nto because we have very bury workloads\nof different um services. So one service\nwe don't need very big machines but when\nthey do need the resources when certain\nrequest comes in they they need to be\nable to to to take up a lot of memory\nand CPU and not necessarily fight each\nother. So the idea was to basically\novers subscribe nodes. Uh which you can\ndo easily with Kubernetes, right? You\ncan you can have only two nodes and and\ngive them give your pods a lot of memory\neven though you don't have the memory\navailable. Um Kubernetes will be able to\nrun them and you can't do that with\nFargate obviously because Fargate you\nhave to give it exactly what you want\nand it's going to run exactly that. You\ncan't really burst. Um so so then we\nneeded to run our own ECS nodes and um\nthat was before AWS announced managed\nnodes by the way that they also just\nannounced like a month ago. Um but\nanyway\n>> wait a minute AWS has had managed ECS\nfor a while. I mean Fargate is managed.\nWhat do you mean?\n>> No no managed managed autoscaling groups\nlike um you didn't have that until like\na month ago.\n>> Okay, I'll take it away.\n[laughter] Okay.\n>> Yeah, they they just announced it like\nyou could spin up right your capacity\nproviders in ECS can be either Fargate\ncapacity provider where they take care\nof everything and you just say the\ndimensions of what you want and they\nwill just you know make it available but\nyou can't oversubscribe really much.\n>> Okay. I see. Okay. So we I think we need\nto to to to what do you call it uh\nconnect to your your grid project. So,\nhow would you introduce your grid\nproject? So, that makes the next video\nkind of\n>> makes sense.\n>> Um,\nhow do I\n>> Well, let me let me see if I can jog\nyour memory. Like, I think you\nintroduced grid to me because you said\nthat, you know, the the whole open tacos\nthings was interesting, but it it didn't\nsupport strongly typed\n>> right\n>> stacks. So the grid API is sort of\ndemonstrating that you can you can\nproperly track your your infrastructure\nstate\nuh yeah in a compelling way using yeah\nthe the strongly typed CDK stacks.\n>> Yes. So, so a lot of these projects that\nwere introduced like from Terram team\nwhich is the state graph and from digger\nwhich is the open tackle um they're just\nfocused on classic terapform which\ndoesn't expose a lot of the type system\nof the resources right so\nstate graph does promise that every\nresource has a type so it should be able\nto give you more information it get it\nit gets rid of all of the states. So\ninstead of having like many many small\nstates, you have one big state graph.\nEvery resource is in there. Every\nresource has like attributes that are\nstrongly typed. So you don't need to go\nthrough the state as a boundary or as an\nencapsulation mechanism. Um because\neverything lives next to each other,\nright? Um with with Digger they are\nstill allowing you to create multiple\nstates and you are able to define the\ndependencies between the states and\nyou're able to define arbback on top of\nthat and now they're integrating with\nwork OS for like you know your\ndeployment mechanisms. I haven't looked\nat open taco recently. Um but the both\nof them I mean I I I kind of like the\nopen taco approach because I still\nbelieve that you want to encapsulate\na little bit like the the the for\nexample the platform team may want to\nencapsulate the landing zone that they\nprovide right um what we as a service\nprovide to other teams we maybe only\nwant to expose the subnet ids and the\nVPC ID and we don't want to like have\nall of the VPC information network\ngateways everything uh All these\nresources don't mean much for other\nteams. We just say this is the landing\nzone and we have a couple of outputs for\nyou, a network ID and a subnet ID and\nyou can launch in there. Right? So to me\na terapform state as an encapsulation\nmechanism still makes sense. I don't\nknow how state graph is going to solve\nthat problem. Um and I talked to them\nand they were like we want type\ninformation just like you. Um but\nthey're building it there on their own.\nThey're doing it in Okamel and I haven't\nbeen really been like able to\ncommunicate with them much\n>> in Okamel. Oh man.\n>> Yeah. So, so then open taco they're\nbuilding this in Golang which is much\nmore approachable in in a DevOps\necosystem because you know Terraform\nKubernetes everything is Golang. So,\nGolang tooling uh is is available and I\ntry to talk to them but they don't\nreally respond at all and also because\nof the reaction of the community towards\nopen taco it feels a little bit like\npersona non grata. So, um I feel like I\nwant something similar that allows me to\nexpose the deeply typed information that\nI have from my library. So I have a\nlibrary that gives you these higher\nlevel constructs. We talked about it. We\nshowed like this the way that you can\nvisualize it. You can define like hey by\nthe way my constructs imple can be\ndisplayed on on a diagram and this is\nhow it displays itself. So you can add\nthese interfaces on top of it. Right.\n>> That demo that we recorded just for\npeople's context was recorded like two\nweeks ago.\n>> You said that you were going to you were\ngoing to specitate the uh the or\n>> authentication. Yeah. I think I said\n[clears throat] in the video back then\nthat I don't think it's going to be\npainful.\n>> It's going to be painful. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. So, so the Was I right, Vincent?\nFor once.\n>> Yes, you were right, Kai. [laughter]\nYou want\nOkay. So, so the speckit experiment was\ntwo, three weeks. I think by the time\nthat we recorded demo, I had spent two\nweeks on it and I had it had raced\nthrough all of my questions and it had\nbuilt a monor repo with Golang. It had\nbuilt a CLI and SDK. has built a UI,\nhooked everything up and you was and\nthat will be shown in the demo. Uh the\none thing missing for me to deploy this\ninto my organization is to have a strong\nauthentication and because you know you\nwant to be able to integrate with SSO uh\nand things like that. So I thought you\nknow I'm just going to ask packet to do\nthat. And I think my biggest mistake was\nto to assume that this could all be done\nin like one feature.\n>> Uh I didn't break it down. I said like\nthis is authentication, authorization\nand um you know no web login and\neverything\n>> SL\nno SL just OIDC uh and and so specit did\na great job three days planning it um\nlike I said I spent 70% time planning\nand then 40% time implementing for some\nother features so I was like I was very\nconfident I was done with the planning\nphase um however it kind of\n>> when when you say planning phase were\nyou using like the plan mode of claude\nor would you use plan mode of spot?\n>> Yes, because the plan mode of cloud\nworks within a context window, right?\nAnd then as soon as a context window is\ndone, maybe you can carry over like with\na compact, you can carry over some to-do\nitems, but it's very limited and a lot\nof context gets lost. So the spec kits\nplanning phase is really focused on\ncapturing all of the functional\nrequirements and like gap analysis and\nedge cases and writing that down into\nmarkdown.\n>> Did you ever play with beads in the end,\nSteve?\nDid you find Yay or nay?\n>> What's your So, so full honesty, I been\nplaying with it only today and so far um\nit does some interesting things. I think\nBeats prompts the agent to spend a\nlittle extra time to to do its own\nplanning phase on each individual issue.\nSo my my biggest problem with speckit as\ndoing this oidc which supposedly I said\nwas going to take me three days and it's\nbeen almost four weeks. Um, my biggest\nissue is that the resulting task lists\nbecame a 2,000line markdown file and\neven you know even when I start on one\nphase maybe six tasks within that\nmassive list of like 80 tasks um it kind\nof like blows the context pretty fast\nlike hey uh cloud we're going to we've\ngot this beautiful plan and research and\neverything.\n>> How do you track the context? is like I\nthink in Claude you have to go\nslashcontext every time and that's\nannoying as hell.\n>> Yeah. So I there's this status bar thing\nnow that you can do but I've got only my\n>> I don't think you can\n>> but there's quite a few people that\nwrite tools that run like demons in the\nbackground that that monitor the context\nand so you could run those demons and\nthen display it in the status bar.\n>> How do you track it then? No,\n>> I I do context. [laughter]\nI haven't installed those state I I just\nI just initiated the status bar in my\ncloud right now. So I I do have like my\noriginal bash prompt. Um and I seen\npeople talk on Reddit about hey here's a\ndemon that shows you your tracks your\nusage. You run the demon and then your\nyour bash prompt can show\n>> how everyone wants this but uh they they\nhaven't delivered on this status bar\nshown.\n>> But they they have delivered on other\ncool stuff but you're really derailing\nme. But they have delivered for example\non on the ability to like you can\ntrigger a plan mode get a plan and then\nyou can control G edit it control J J\nthe the G how [clears throat] you say G\n>> okay\n>> gangster um\n>> yeah golf\n>> so you can you can edit the plan now\nbefore when the plan wasn't right you\nhad to you put in a prompt and say no no\nno you're missing this and then it would\ndo another plan and then it would miss\nsomething else\n>> okay so going back to beads your\nthousand line markdown or whatever you\n>> so so this a problem right uh I've got\nthis massive task list from the speckit\nuh research phase and planning phase so\nnot the cloud mode like not the cloud\ncode planning but the specit planning\nwhich is multiple steps a big workflow\ngenerates a lot of research and creates\nvery detailed tasks of like multiple\nphases it became huge because my feature\nwas too big and I should have probably\ncut it down but what I'm hoping now um\nis with beats it actually parses out the\ntasks and tracks them not in a markdown\nfile but in like a database like an SQL\nlight right and it synchronize the\ndatabase file to a JSON format like JSON\nL so you can you know committ it to your\ngit so you can see the diffs yeah and\nthey can even handle the merges of\ncompleted task better supposedly but I\nhaven't done that yet so so with beats\nnow I had a actually just had a very\nnice experience which was it had\ncompleted three tasks and it hadn't\nblocked so beats speeds ads workflow and\nit had unblocked the next task and then\nI was not using son I was using haiku\nand haiku\nlooked at the issue that it needed to\nwork on the task that it needed to work\non and it went into this like planning\nmode which I think is something that\nbeats introduced because I've never seen\ncloud do that until I activated beats\nand after it went into the planning mode\nit came up with its plan and it was\ndifferent from I mean it something\nwasn't right I there was some mistakes\nin there I was like that's not right And\nso the cool thing is I didn't have to\nopen my markdown file and then scroll\ndown to this like phase number eight\nwhich is at line 800 and then find\nexactly what was the original task that\nit was supposed to work on. I could just\nrun beat show that issue originally that\nyou started with and I saw immediately\nlike hey there's a mistake here. Uh and\nso it it really allowed me to slice and\ndice directly to the particular task. So\ninstead of having like uh this massive\nmarkdowns that you have to also blow up\nyour context with you can now like very\ndirectly ask questions about partic\nparticular issues and look at them and\nfind the links between them. So because\nit creates a graph of issues right so so\nfar\n>> of the the links have you like linked\nthem up like showing which ones depend\non another or does it do it\nautomatically?\n>> It did it automatically. So I I asked uh\nyeah I\nI have recorded the loom about this\nprocess. Um but it's a bit messy. Uh\nbasically what happened is\nI was going back and forth between cloud\nand Gemini. Gemini is not good at\nwriting code but it's great at reading\ncode and giving like a review of another\nperson of another plan. Codex can do the\nsame thing but Gemini does it much\nfaster. So what happened is cloud came\nup with this plan. we're going to do\nABC. And then I went to Gemini. I said,\n\"Mate, does that make sense? Like, can\nyou go look if that already exists?\" And\nGemini says, \"No, none of these things\nexist. That is but that is\ncorrect.\" So then I went back to cloud\nand I came up with like a 300line\num prompt and and then I push push it\ninto um a new cloud instance with Beats\nactivated because you have to like\ninstall the MCP, you have to initialize\nyour agent, you have to make sure that\nit knows that it needs to use Beats. And\nthen I gave it this 300 line prompt that\nI fine-tuned with Gemini and it went\nahead and created okay Gemini made it\nvery clear we need to do this this this\nthen this and then cloud used beats\ncreated all the issues linked them\ntogether what what depended on what uh\nwhat unblocks what and then created a a\nbeautiful graph and it started with the\nne the first two issues that were\navailable.\n>> Show a graph.\n>> Um\n>> you're right. Uh I haven't I haven't\nlooked at the I haven't seen a graph,\nbut I've seen the the full JSON output\nand I've seen the full list and I've\nbeen able to look at the issues uh very\nquickly. So I haven't uh tried the graph\nyet but so far like I said I think beads\nadds through its MCP tools some\ninstructions to like prompt cloud when\nit picks up an issue to do some\nadditional research and and the issue\nitself that was created by cloud within\nbeats actually has a lot of context. It\ncaptured all of the requirements,\nacceptance criteria and things like\nthat, which is I was surprised because I\nthought, you know, when you have a to-do\nlist in in cloud, it's just like one\nline. I need to do this one thing. I\ndon't know how cloud tracks more\ninformation than that just one line. But\nin Beats, I can see it. Like there's a\ntitle and there's a description. It says\nlike this is what we need to do. This is\nwhy we need to do it. These are the\nfiles we need to change. And this is the\nacceptance criteria. Was like, oh,\nthat's pretty cool. I'm not sure. I'm\nnot a thousand% sure it's the MCP\nbecause I noticed when I hit this MCP\nbug last week that that uh Claude, for\nexample, was just invoking the BD CLI\nright on my my sh.\n>> Yeah, I I had to bootstrap um the agent\nto make sure that it has like you need\nto use the tools, not not the CLI\n>> BD quick start or whatever inside your\nagents MD or whatever.\n>> Yeah, I did. I did. I did the BD on\nboarding. Um, and so yeah, but I also\nwanted to originally like why do I need\nan MCP? Like I hate MCPS because\n>> Yeah, I don't that's what I was going to\nsay next. I don't think you need an MCP,\nbut uh just because\n>> it was broken and it seemed to still\nwork.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And um I also\ninstalled the agent skill. So be beats\nalso has like this new thing from cloud\ncalled uh a like skills.\n>> All right. I think I think on the web\npage you can it's called a plugin. Is\nthat the same thing? No,\n>> I'm not sure. So I didn't want to\ninstall the plugin. I I didn't know what\nit was going to do. So I actually went\nthrough everything that the plugin does\nmyself. Like I installed the the the\nCLI. I think we you have to do anyway.\nYou have to install the CLI and then I\nused UV to install the tool which is the\nMCP. So I can run the MCP directly. I\ndid not install it as a as a as a as a\nplug-in. And then I had to do the the\nthe gith hooks, but that's part of your\nBD init. So when you init in a\nrepository, it will create your git\nhooks. Then it had something like do you\nwant to go multi-reo? And I think that's\none of the cool features is that it can\ndo multi-reo. But mine is a very big\nmonor repo, so I don't want to do that.\nSo I was like, it gave me a warning.\n>> I didn't know that.\n>> Yeah, there's a demon.\n>> Yeah,\n>> that's this is really good. Okay. I\nmean, I think we have to cut it here\nbecause I I\n>> think we need to do a separate session\non beat. Yeah,\n>> I don't know if you have enough for\nintro. Uh, but yeah,\n>> we got plenty for intro. I mean, I'm\nhoping just to cut this. I also need to\ngo and uh yeah, and I'll time stamp it\nso people could skip it if they wanted\nto. Okay,\n>> by the end of this week, I want to um\ntry beads with speckit. So now I'm\nlearning it like on my current task like\nbut then the next step is I want speckit\nnot to create this 20,000 line markdown.\nI want speckit to use beats. I haven't\ndone that yet. Um, so I'm using I'm\nlearning it first. Yeah,\n>> sounds awesome. Okay, we'll keep in\ntouch. See you.\n>> Bye. Okay, see you. Have a nice day.\nReally really enjoy this. I think we\ncovered a lot of things. I think\n>> maybe.\nOkay, one more thing.\n>> Um, so so basically we talked about open\ntaco and all of these state management\nsolutions also. Now we just talked about\nthe integration patterns, right? We\nmentioned that you can you can use a\nvariable file on disk or a big config\nfile that keeps track of all of the\ndifferent like a dictionary of all of\nthe different integration keys. Right?\nSo at my organization we we started\noriginally trying to use an integration\nregistry. Then we move towards like the\nteams only publish dev from their\nproduct repo and when they want to go to\nstaging and need to integrate there they\npublish their infrastructure as a\npackage and then we consume it and\nintegrate it within our monor repo. So\nwe have a big terapform monor repo. A\nlot of organizations have a big\nterapform monor repo because you have\nthose file system requirements to read\ndata, right? Um because we couldn't use\nthe integration registry. So instead\nthey publish their artifact, they\nversion it and then we integrate it. The\nsame for production. Um but I still want\nto have the ability to go across\nrepositories and integrate without um\nyou know having to publish things. So\nthat's why I started to build this thing\ncalled the grid which is around Terra\nconstructs. So Terra constructs has\nalready the capability of strongly\ntyping your outputs. So if you need to\nintegrate on things, you know exactly\nwhat the shape will look like of what\nyou depend on. For example, if we have a\ncluster, we we may have a VPC ID output.\nWe have subnets which is an array of\nstrings. We may have more more\ncomplicated integration points, right?\nUm but let me just let me just run the\nAPI real quick. API surf\nuh not server surf\nbinary.\n>> Let's put it on the path. So now this\nthe the grid API is running and I will\ngo into the web app and run the the the\ndashboard. It's a very basic dashboard.\n>> Everything's a bit slow right now. I\ndon't know why. Okay. Maybe it's because\nI have 100 different things open.\n>> Yes, it's V hot moderator load. Vue.js,\nright?\n>> Uh no, this is React. [laughter] I don't\nknow anything about front end. Um so so\nthis was all written using specit using\nuh specdriven development.\n>> Holy moly.\n>> And yeah and and some of the UI elements\noriginally bootstrapped by bolt. Uh but\nthen yeah so so this is basically the\ngrid when you are creating for example\nthe network which has a bunch of in this\ncase there are zero outputs because I\nhaven't really applied anything. Um but\nthen you have dependencies that define\nfor example the staging cluster depends\non the subnet ids from the network and\non the VPC ID from the network also the\nstaging database depends on the VPC ID\nto provision into the network\n>> right so we have these dependency\ntrackers and this is really the idea was\nmainly from open taco right\n>> why why are there two arrows going into\nthe cluster am I going\n>> because multiple every output is tracked\nindividually\n>> okay\n>> okay I I can do a demo where I actually\napply things with Terraform so you can\nsee the colors change when things and\nthen you know why there's multiple\nerrors. This this is a a preset database\nwith some filtering. So I can\n>> you know we we we need to do like a\nvisual\nI think the theme for the next chat is a\nvisual infrastructure because I did want\nto talk about uh Adam Jacobs uh oh my\ngod\nwhat is this startup called? Help me\nGod.\n>> Uh system initiative.\n>> Yeah\n>> I right\n>> because I'm think I'm thinking system\ninitiative when I'm looking at this.\nI'm not building uh what he call a\ndynamic graph where every node has like\ndifferent their own um hooks on create,\nread, update, delete. So it's a\nprogrammable graph. That's what system.\n>> Okay. Okay. So yours is more of like a\nlike a visualization type of\n>> mine is a terraform state on um manager\nand the idea is to integrate tightly\nwith terra constructs so that all of\nthese um all of these\npoints here are actually strongly typed.\nSo if I if I'm\nyou can see your level twos and things\nlike that in here.\n>> Yeah, but I'm I'm using modules as an\nencapsulation. So whatever the product\nteam they can be writing terapform\nmodules in here. Uh sorry I'm not using\nmodules in encapsulation. I'm using\nstates as an encapsulation. So the so in\nmy case the platform team is using the\nAWS VPC module to provision the the\nnetwork and all.\n>> Okay. Okay. State state state. Got it.\n>> Yeah. And if they want to expose the VPC\nand the subnet ids they should be able\nto expose them as with the schema. So if\nthey're doing it using terra construct\nthe schema is attached to the L2s. So if\nyou you know you say to the L2 push your\noutputs out to your state so you know\nyou make it available as a as a contract\nto other teams then other teams when\nthey use Terra constructs they will read\nthat output and they get the schema with\nit. So they know that this this output\nhas this shape because this is one of\nthe problems that I have when I was\nusing the integration registry, right? I\nwhat are the parts that write things and\nhow do I find the keys that I need and\nwhat is the shape of those keys? How do\nI write them down? How do I read them\nback out so that I get a strongly\nversioned um feedback\n>> contracts and stuff? Yeah.\n>> Right. So let me let me uh do a database\nreset\nhere. Um go back make DB reset.\nIt's going to delete the Postgress\nvolume and restart it.\n>> Okay. Oh,\n>> by the way, um why didn't you use SQL\nlight? You just\n>> It's I'm using an ORM. Uh and it's using\nthe PG dialect if I want to use SQL. I'm\nactually adding SQL light as a next\nstep.\n>> Um\n>> that's that's one that's the next\nfeature that speckit's going to be\nworking. Unsurprisingly, Claude is an\nabsolute demon with uh with SQL Light\nbecause SQL Light has like no proper\ngolem times and types and stuff, right?\n>> Um I don't really know. Couldn't\n>> When you say demon, do you mean the\nbeast like really good at it or the\ndemon like chaotic?\n>> No. No. I'm It's really good at it. Like\nit able\n>> I thought demon like like it's a devil.\n>> No, I love it. it like it it was able to\ncreate these like materialized views and\nother optimizations to to make quite\ncomplex views really simple to generate.\nI mean it's so incredible really.\nSo I I will restart the grid API server\nand I will restart the web app.\nOkay. And now if I refresh there's\nnothing in there, right? So now if I go\nto the\n>> by the way you can you can bootstrap\ntasks in VS code if you have instead of\nlike\nthere. Yeah\n>> it's it's just search VS code tasks\nyou'll find out how to do it.\n>> Okay I'll need to do that. So I go into\nthe example Terraform. So here I have a\nsome setup and I should clear but I will\njust create a network and um okay so I\ngo into the network I\nI remove anything that's there. So right\nnow there's just the terraform\nconfiguration which is\n>> just um a null resource. It's not really\nanything. It's not using AWS but it\nsimulates a VPC output with the ID of\nthe null resource and a subnet ID. It's\nnot the list. It's just an example.\n>> Go to the top of the file. Why did you\nOkay, so you just specify the provider.\nOh, actually\n>> it's a single file. Okay.\n>> Yeah, it's all it's all it's it's really\njust a sample Terraform configuration\nand I will use the grid uh control. So\nthis command line currently is just a\nsample CLI implementation. For my\npersonal use, I'm going to use it to\nintegrate within our bootstrapping\nbecause we have like a a Golang CLI to\nbootstrap Terraform and so I'm going to\nuse it to automatically integrate with\nthe API. So the the CLI is just one\nsample implementation that I include\nwith the monor repo but I have my own\nthat I I need to integrate it into. So\nI'm using state create to create a new\nstate and I have to give it a logic ID.\nSo this is one of the first things in\nterapform or in infrastructure a lot of\ntimes names change. So maybe this could\nbe like the uh product a network or\nsomething like that. But over time we\nrealize that actually product a network\nshould be shared and it should now\nbecome shared network. So the logic ID\nis decoupled under the hood. generates a\nunique identity separately. The CLI uses\nUID v7 but this is again the database\naccepts whatever the client wants to use\n>> that's actually uh a really good idea\nbecause the minute we have to change our\nTF state uh\n>> it becomes a nightmare more so if you\nuse back end key uh I'm I'm always just\nyeah I hate that\n>> you need to do migrations then you need\nto keep tracking where the other states\nwere that you depend on\n>> yeah so I like this idea but I mean\nyou're only just using it to just keep\ntrack of it you're not using it to help\nmanage\nuh\nwhat uh the logic ID yeah the logic ID\nis is is a is a mutable attribute of the\nstate but it can be uh but it is\nglobally constrained as unique so across\nthe postress there's I mean\n>> I I like the idea but like you're not\nusing it to actually store the state\nyou're just using it to keep track of it\nof course\n>> yeah uh yeah we're just we're just using\nit to keep track of it as a unique\nidentifier\n>> yeah it's a good idea\nso at This point I have created by the\nway I have not run terraform apply yet\nbut if I refresh and I will make this\nlike polling uh with like web workers\nwhatever but right now I just forced it\nto be to this is one thing when you do\nspecd driven development it's really\nimportant to scope things down and at\nthis point I thought like this might be\ntoo complicated so I put it very\nexplicit put\n>> I mean to be honest I'm I'm gang refresh\nI don't like to uh to wait for things to\nhappen\n>> automatically so now terapform init and\napply\nwill then\nregister the subnet ID and the VPC ID as\noutputs in in the grid. Right? So this\nthis is running Terapform, right? I'm\nnot running anything else. This is\nliterally just Terraform talking to the\ngrid API and then grid API is extracting\nthe outputs and keeping track of them\nokay separately. So if I do grid ctl\nlist\n>> uh state list,\n>> I can see it. I can also um I can see\nit's clean because it's just been\napplied. So if I go to my uh cluster\nwhich needs to depend on the network,\nlet me remove every terapform file or\ngrid uh file that should be in there. So\nit's only the no resources again that\nare in here, right? And in this case the\ncluster needs to read the network VPC\nID, right? It it depends on that. So I\ncan say grid ctl state create cluster u\nlogic ID, right? And then grit ctl u\ndeps add from network and it will bind\nthe outputs of the network and this is\nwhere the type will be important right\nbut right now this is a non Terra\nconstruct demo this is pure terapform no\ntyping yet right\n>> so in this case I'm the the two the the\nselection is a bit weird you need to\npress enter I'm going to change that but\nanyway um it was a default\n>> generated by AI I can tell\n>> yeah [laughter] I think it's a pterm\ndefault so right now the network and the\ncluster has a dependency and now you see\nwhy these errors are separated because\nyou have two different outputs and they\nmay evolve separately. So the cluster\ndepends on the network.\n>> Sorry, the yeah the cluster depends on\nthe network. If I do grid ctl state\nlist, I can see that the clust the the\ncluster is stale because it has not been\napplied. It has not been observed by the\ngrid API, right?\n>> The grid ctl state in it again generates\nthe\n>> the backend config for me.\n>> But now comes the interesting part. I\ncan use grid ctl or whatever however I\nintegrate the SDK into my command line\nor my Golang tooling to to in or to sync\nthe depths. So to sync the depths means\nit's going to generate the remote state\nlookup for the network using that unique\nidentity and then pre-generating the\nnetwork locals for me. So I know that\nthere's a subnet ID. Again, this is\nbecause I declare that this state needs\nthose two outputs. So it's going to\ngenerate\n>> you're using the data is using the grid\nbackend to grab the to make the link.\nOkay. You so you're not relying on the\nfile system.\n>> So I have yeah no no file system. So I\ncan go across repositories right. So\nthis is an API server which is our think\nyou can pretty much do this with space\nlift. You can do this with Terraform\ncloud for sure.\n>> This is something I think would be\nincredibly fun to deploy in my\nworkplace. So I mean do you have a\nstandalone binary which I can start\nrunning and linking up uh different uh\nstate files and and drawing a graph? I\nthink that has a lot of value actually.\nIt has a lot of value. This is going to\nbe Apache to open source. I want to open\nsource this once I've got the type\nschema integration with Terra construct.\nI it's right now it's in GitHub private\nrepo. I can give you access. Um I'm not\nsure about open sourcing it because it's\nvery I mean at this point it's similar\nto open taco. I have to be honest. I I I\ntalked to the Open Taco people. I\nunderstood how they use it.\n>> It's not Open Taco, it's the [laughter]\ngrid. Um they're they're doing great\nwork with Open Taco by the way. I look\non the pull requests, they are adding a\nlot of features. They added SQL light\nalready and and they they're using\nLightream. I I think that's what\n>> So they they bas So so there's a lot of\noverlap what you're doing in open\ntyping.\n>> There's a lot of overlap except I want\ntype schemas and they're not talking to\nme. [laughter]\nSo, I'm like, like I said, I told them\nthat I could oneshot this in cloud, so I\ntook 10 days to oneshot this in cloud.\n[laughter]\n>> Oh, man. I'm loving the innovation here.\nI'm loving it. Um, yeah, I mean, I I I\ndefinitely would love to to to have this\nvisualization on on some state files.\nUm, but I don't I'm just playing I'm\njust playing devil's advocate here,\nVince. I just I I I see myself\n>> u enjoying like a visualization\n>> but not the type schema.\n>> But uh but even the type schema that\ncould help me uh to do some bugs or\nsomething like that. Um, I mean that's\nthe way that's the way I see typing is\nlike helping me figure out where there's\nissues\n>> uh like I I would see it as a\nvisualization but like but that's that's\na hard that's a hard sell as a as a\nproduct like you know like it's\n>> I'm not selling it like I'm I'm so my\nmain goal here is um to basically make\nsomething available that I can use\nmyself. Also the way I designed it, I I\nmake the package the SDK is a strongly\ntype Golang and because I'm using\nconnect RPC, I also created TypeScript\npackage because that's what I use in my\ndashboard in my web app. So in my web\napp, I'm actually using the um the grit\num where is it the grid? Where is the\ngrid tacons? Here I'm using the TCON. Um\nI'm autogenerating the clients in\nTypescript and in Golang. Uh it could be\nJava, whatever because it's using\nconnect RPC. Uh al although I do need to\nwrap it because connect RPC handlers are\npretty horrible. And anyway, what I want\nis to basically use this one in my\nlibrary to\n>> interact grid. It's some third party.\nWhat is that?\n>> No, that's my workspace. So that's my TS\nSDK, right? It's autogenerated from from\nthe protobuff definitions and then a\nlittle\n>> tons\nconstructs. Oh,\n>> it's all my project, baby. [laughter]\n>> Okay. Okay. I'm a little bit slow. No,\nbut it looks I I definitely see the\nvalue in that. I really would like to\ntry that out, actually.\n>> Yeah. So, how it differs from open taco\nis they're focused on like you can\ncontrol the grid using the Terraform\nprovider. My goal is I'm giving you an\nSDK. I can generate the terapform\nprovider from the SDK. I can generate um\nJavaScript integrations with the grid\nwhich is what I'm doing for my project\nbecause I want you know and I want\nadditional endpoints control. I want to\ncontrol what is it that you can attach\nto a state. I want to be able or to the\ndependencies the outputs itself. That's\nwhat I want to control. So um so I'm\ndoing this currently with with specit\nand I'm telling you this like 14 days\nnow and I've been able to bootstrap the\nrepo, build the state dependency logic,\nadd some CLI improvements, wire up the\ndashboard um and now I'm working on\nauthentication and authorization. So\nOIDC integration\n>> actually I'm curious what it ends up\ndoing there. I was think in a web app or\nwhatever app is always interesting. So\nmy prompt was very very dumb. Um and it\ntook me I think the last [clears throat]\neight hours to\n>> I want to out because no tech right\nyou're not supposed to say the tech. So\nit's like I need to add authentication\nauthorization and arbback control. I\nwant to um basically protect both the\ncontrol plane. Well actually somebody\nelse onem I think I think again go codex\ndoesn't doesn't give a Codex just\nwent and changed my prompt cuz I didn't\ngive it that prompt. I gave it a much\nsimpler prompt and Codex went like\nactually the user is doing a lot more\nand he's like we have a control plane\nwhich is our grid API and then we have\nthe data plane which is the terraform\ninteracting with the terapform state. So\nboth of them need to be covered by\nauthorization and I need to expose like\nthe authentication token to the\nterraform process so that it can\nactually run the apply. So it's very\ninteresting. Uh I think I've nailed the\ntasks now. I'm pretty sure I can get\nthis like authentication. Well, I'll be\ninterested because I think this one\nmight be one that it might trip on up\non, but uh cool.\n>> Hey,\n>> I'll let you know. Hey,\n>> that was awesome, Vincent. Oh, one more\nthing. Just one more thing.\n>> So, so I just ran the apply, right? So,\nright now it shows that it has conf\nconsumed and they are clean.\n>> Now, what happens when the network\nchanges? Like that happens all the time,\nright? People recreate network.\n>> Why did you say clean and and and stale?\nI mean, that's doesn't seem like the the\nright terminology. I mean, with drift\nwith drift detection in terraform, it's\nthey do they say stale and clean? I've\ngone\n>> I have no idea. I just\n>> Okay, you just made them up. Okay,\nwhatever.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, there's a thing here with the\nnetwork. For some reason, every time you\napply uh a time stamp forces the VPC to\nbe recreated.\n>> Very convenient.\nSo at this point this one has changed\nand recreated the output. And if I\nrefresh now we see that the subnets are\nthe same but the VPCS. Well, this is not\nrealistic example, right? But that's why\n>> it's interesting because it flags um a\ntypical problem, right?\n>> Yes. So this is one of the problems of\nthe integration registry, right? Where\nwe're not able to keep track of like who\nlost the value. This is actually 100%\nopen taco because they have an in digest\nand an out digest on the edge when the\nwhen you dry these edges. So whenever a\nstate files get written it keep captures\nthe outputs and writes out the out\ndigest and all the other states whenever\nthey apply they they they um observe the\nincoming outputs and they write out\ntheir indigest. So, whenever the\nindigest and the out digest differs,\nthat's when an arrow is no longer um\nclean, basically.\n>> I don't quite understand, but I'll have\nto try it, I guess.\n>> Yeah, never mind. Like,\n>> okay, so time time out, man. My brain is\nabout to turn to to mush.\n>> That's it. That's it, really. Um\n>> thanks, Vincent. And if if anyone got\nthis far, I I really applaud you. You\n>> look I think we're gonna cut this.\nI drive for 4 hours to work uh because I\nwork in London. So I I don't mind long\nform content to be honest. It's better\nthan listening to like hey,\nyou know, I kind of\n>> I think you will look Ah, you mean like\nlast time when I cut it, it was too\nmuch.\n>> No, no, I think I think I think I think\nyou do what what I would do. You mean\nyou cut it pretty well for the first\nthird, but the two the last two/3s you\ndidn't cut it.\nI mean, that was my impression. Maybe\nyou cut it so well I didn't even notice.\n>> Uh, I don't remember. But I do try to.\n>> This is two hours of content. It's It's\ngoing to be so hard to cut it. But if\nyou want to cut it, you do you, Vincent.\n>> You don't know me. I I record myself\nusing Speckit for four hours and I cut\nit down into like a 30 minute like to\nthe interesting section.\n>> I do.\n>> So you're uploading videos of you using\nSpeckit already. I have loom I share\nwith my colleagues or with my friends\nand then I see nobody watch it.\n>> Come on, [laughter] get a YouTube\nchannel. Get a YouTube channel.\n>> Someone will watch. I don't know who you\nare, but thank you.\n>> Okay, see you.\n>> I don't know how am I going to get this.\nYeah. See you. Have a lunch or whatever.\n>> Yeah. Bye. You too. Cheers. Good night.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:40]\nWhy did you move to Vietnam? Just because you bought a place, I suppose, just like I moved to >> No, no. I I I came to Vietnam in 2006 and um I worked 10 years as a professional services um consultant implementing ERP systems like financial management system called infor systems. And so that was mostly with international clients. So I was based out of Vietnam but I would be traveling all the time. And my background is software engineering, but um I spent 10 years training people on how to enter invoices into an accounting system without knowing anything about accounting initially. Um, so that was like and that's kind of where I learned that you really only understand something if you um if you can explain it to someone else but also you get a very different perspective from other people cuz they put me in front of like manuals of this accounting system and they said okay in one month you're going to the customer you're going to shadow a senior first and then later you're going to have to do the trainings on your own. >> So you're training like Vietnamese? >> No, no, no. International. So I was based out of Vietnam, but um the company I worked for had a very big contract with Hilton Hotels Worldwide. So I went mostly to Hilton hotels like Gardening or >> Are you allowed to say these people's names or do I have to retract? >> No, it's fine. [laughter] I worked 10 years um for pretty much mainly on Hilton and some other hospitality clients. >> All right. But yeah, I mean it's it's not a secret. >> Yeah. >> Then how did you get into infrastructure then? How did you become a Kubern I mean I think I knew you back in Singapore as a Kubernetes um zealot, >> right? >> Made me absolutely made which made me want to push you away because I I I I just had bad experience after bad experience with with Kubernetes. I mean I use community don't get me wrong and when it when it's appropriate but uh it it does frustrate me. >> Yeah. So after about you know 7 years of going to customers. So from 2006 until 2013 about um most of the time I would you know we would we would be there to a whole day to install a Windows systems you know we would be having a word document and we would have our installation you know with the requirements for the client because every customer we work with they have different requirements. if they are a real estate investment fund in Luxembourg, they have different security requirements than the hospitality like the way that they manage the servers,…\n\n[slide:2] [5:19–16:37]\nkind of realized that all of this Windows manual process is kind of nonsense. And I started looking also I wanted to run game servers. And I learned I I had like we we bought like a Power Edge Dell server that we wanted to put in a data center like a colo in in Vietnam with a friend to run games on it. And he needed Windows. >> Yeah. I wanted Counter Strike uh you CS:GO at the time, >> right around 2013. And um at the time he needed Windows for he he ran a big gaming uh news website iame.vietnam in Vietnam and um he needed he wanted to host an up andcoming game but it was Windows only. So I ran my my we needed to run VMs right Windows and um and Linux and so then I also wanted to have better performance because as soon as you run Counter Strike in the VM you start having performance problems. So I started to play with like Linux containers uh and Docker at the time and that's how I got into Docker originally and I started going to to uh meetups in in Vietnam to learn about like I want to ingest because I wanted to get create a gaming platform for Counterstrike that was like ESL existed, HLTV existed. Those are very big like Counterstrike related related services and I felt that they did not give a lot of like statistics. There was um fragbite sorry not fragbite got frag in America they gave oh and esa they had very detailed statistics uh like about your contribution to a round they calculated so they could assign skill points to a player much better than most of the other platforms. Yeah. So I was like I had built gaming I had run gaming tournaments in in Belgium. So I knew how to get all of the logs so you could get every single event from the locks. So you could tell the the Counter-Strike server to send all the locks to you. And I was used to like >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I was used basically at the time you used like like IRC bots, you know, you say a certain keyword and that message was received and the bot would would um identify with a regular expression or whatever or just look if the if the text starts with a certain keyword and then it would execute commands. So people would say things and if it had that command then the bot would respond. So, we had like a bot that would read the Counter Strike logs and then would keep track of the score uh and then keep track of like when it needs to restart or switch the teams so they could, you know, manage a tournament. So, I was like, cool, I just need to ingest all of the the statistics about the players. So, I…\n\n[slide:3] [16:17–27:35]\nAnd I thought >> everything it changed so much >> like how like if I'm running my app how many replicas do I need? Do I need two three four five 10? Do I do I do it to to maximize the resour so >> like I I never >> when I'm talking about 2014 15 all of that was like very basic. Um today you would obviously use like autoscaling you would um even you have vertical autoscaling now you can resize pods without restarting them. Those are all things that you can do stable because like I just it is >> because because a few years ago I just thought I I just don't trust this autoscaler but um but yeah may maybe I'm >> so so that that's how I got into it right I mean initially I was doing coros for my friend startup um and every time the droplet every time cor updated nobody has access anymore because [laughter] I was maintaining their SSH keys separately >> what was relation ship between core o and kubernetes because coros came out of docker didn't it? No what did it >> no coros is a was a company um that was also called coros and they had an um they had an operating system called coros which was a container centric operating system. So you would run even your debug tools you would run everything through contra containers and the actual it was kind of like a precursor to Talos uh today I think >> um that idea of like using docker images to like I don't know um get your basic bash or something well I mean bash is not a good example but like your tooling yeah >> yeah and and chores originally they they had their own scheduler right um that they built separate from kubernetes which was fleet and fleet They basically extended the idea of a systemd unit to um to something that you could run across multiple nodes and you had some scheduling constraints on the systemd unit. I forgot the name of it that uh it was a set of units or something like that. Uh but as Kubernetes became more popular they deprecated their own fleet and they started they adopted um Kubernetes and then they built their own flavor of it called tectonic. >> The Kubernetes is system D3. Um, so it feels like systemd went head-to-head with Kubernetes and Kubernetes one, right? >> M, not really. I mean, systemd was the way to run like was replacing your upstart and your init systems on the operating system, right? And Redhead made it the default and a lot of uh distributions like rejected it, but then Ubuntu adopted it and then everyone followed. >> Uses a different well c what what's the name of the…\n\n[slide:4] [27:15–38:33]\nreally know the trade-offs. If we only know one tool, we think this is the best tool ever until we start using other >> tools. When people try to sell themselves as as a Kubernetes infrastructure engineer, like why don't you learn learn other things, a dude? >> But the good thing is though, like I use Fargate a lot at work now. And there's several cases where we're like, oh, we need to do this thing or that thing. And I'm like, well, that that would just be an ingress manifest on Kubernetes and that would just be like something like a service mesh or like an >> trade-offs, the comparisons. That's very >> you very quickly like find the limitations where you're like well in Kubernetes I would have I would control my my service mesh or my uh overlay network. Uh for example one issue that we had is we wanted to save cost and use like memory swappiness and like be able to because we have very bury workloads of different um services. So one service we don't need very big machines but when they do need the resources when certain request comes in they they need to be able to to to take up a lot of memory and CPU and not necessarily fight each other. So the idea was to basically overs subscribe nodes. Uh which you can do easily with Kubernetes, right? You can you can have only two nodes and and give them give your pods a lot of memory even though you don't have the memory available. Um Kubernetes will be able to run them and you can't do that with Fargate obviously because Fargate you have to give it exactly what you want and it's going to run exactly that. You can't really burst. Um so so then we needed to run our own ECS nodes and um that was before AWS announced managed nodes by the way that they also just announced like a month ago. Um but anyway >> wait a minute AWS has had managed ECS for a while. I mean Fargate is managed. What do you mean? >> No no managed managed autoscaling groups like um you didn't have that until like a month ago. >> Okay, I'll take it away. [laughter] Okay. >> Yeah, they they just announced it like you could spin up right your capacity providers in ECS can be either Fargate capacity provider where they take care of everything and you just say the dimensions of what you want and they will just you know make it available but you can't oversubscribe really much. >> Okay. I see. Okay. So we I think we need to to to to what do you call it uh connect to your your grid project. So, how would you introduce your grid project? So, that makes…\n\n[slide:5] [38:13–49:31]\nis with beats it actually parses out the tasks and tracks them not in a markdown file but in like a database like an SQL light right and it synchronize the database file to a JSON format like JSON L so you can you know committ it to your git so you can see the diffs yeah and they can even handle the merges of completed task better supposedly but I haven't done that yet so so with beats now I had a actually just had a very nice experience which was it had completed three tasks and it hadn't blocked so beats speeds ads workflow and it had unblocked the next task and then I was not using son I was using haiku and haiku looked at the issue that it needed to work on the task that it needed to work on and it went into this like planning mode which I think is something that beats introduced because I've never seen cloud do that until I activated beats and after it went into the planning mode it came up with its plan and it was different from I mean it something wasn't right I there was some mistakes in there I was like that's not right And so the cool thing is I didn't have to open my markdown file and then scroll down to this like phase number eight which is at line 800 and then find exactly what was the original task that it was supposed to work on. I could just run beat show that issue originally that you started with and I saw immediately like hey there's a mistake here. Uh and so it it really allowed me to slice and dice directly to the particular task. So instead of having like uh this massive markdowns that you have to also blow up your context with you can now like very directly ask questions about partic particular issues and look at them and find the links between them. So because it creates a graph of issues right so so far >> of the the links have you like linked them up like showing which ones depend on another or does it do it automatically? >> It did it automatically. So I I asked uh yeah I I have recorded the loom about this process. Um but it's a bit messy. Uh basically what happened is I was going back and forth between cloud and Gemini. Gemini is not good at writing code but it's great at reading code and giving like a review of another person of another plan. Codex can do the same thing but Gemini does it much faster. So what happened is cloud came up with this plan. we're going to do ABC. And then I went to Gemini. I said, \"Mate, does that make sense? Like, can you go look if that already exists?\" And Gemini says, \"No, none of these things…\n\n[slide:6] [49:11–55:30]\nteam they can be writing terapform modules in here. Uh sorry I'm not using modules in encapsulation. I'm using states as an encapsulation. So the so in my case the platform team is using the AWS VPC module to provision the the network and all. >> Okay. Okay. State state state. Got it. >> Yeah. And if they want to expose the VPC and the subnet ids they should be able to expose them as with the schema. So if they're doing it using terra construct the schema is attached to the L2s. So if you you know you say to the L2 push your outputs out to your state so you know you make it available as a as a contract to other teams then other teams when they use Terra constructs they will read that output and they get the schema with it. So they know that this this output has this shape because this is one of the problems that I have when I was using the integration registry, right? I what are the parts that write things and how do I find the keys that I need and what is the shape of those keys? How do I write them down? How do I read them back out so that I get a strongly versioned um feedback >> contracts and stuff? Yeah. >> Right. So let me let me uh do a database reset here. Um go back make DB reset. It's going to delete the Postgress volume and restart it. >> Okay. Oh, >> by the way, um why didn't you use SQL light? You just >> It's I'm using an ORM. Uh and it's using the PG dialect if I want to use SQL. I'm actually adding SQL light as a next step. >> Um >> that's that's one that's the next feature that speckit's going to be working. Unsurprisingly, Claude is an absolute demon with uh with SQL Light because SQL Light has like no proper golem times and types and stuff, right? >> Um I don't really know. Couldn't >> When you say demon, do you mean the beast like really good at it or the demon like chaotic? >> No. No. I'm It's really good at it. Like it able >> I thought demon like like it's a devil. >> No, I love it. it like it it was able to create these like materialized views and other optimizations to to make quite complex views really simple to generate. I mean it's so incredible really. So I I will restart the grid API server and I will restart the web app. Okay. And now if I refresh there's nothing in there, right? So now if I go to the >> by the way you can you can bootstrap tasks in VS code if you have instead of like there. Yeah >> it's it's just search…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "Vincent De Smet discusses his professional journey from implementing ERP systems in Vietnam to becoming a specialist in cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes. The conversation covers the evolution of container orchestration, the technical trade-offs between different cloud services, and the development of his new project, Grid. De Smet details how his background in manual system administration led him to seek better automation and type safety in infrastructure as code. He also provides a deep dive into his current development workflow, which leverages AI agents and spec-driven development to build complex software systems.\n\n[slide:1]\n## From ERP Consulting to Infrastructure Automation\nVincent De Smet moved to Vietnam in 2006, initially working for a decade as a professional services consultant. His primary role involved implementing Infor ERP systems for international clients, including major hospitality brands like Hilton Hotels. During this time, he learned that *you really only understand something if you if you can explain it to someone else* while training users on complex accounting software. His transition toward software engineering and infrastructure began as he sought to automate the repetitive, manual processes of installing Windows systems. He moved from following static Word documents with screenshots to writing extensive PowerShell scripts. These scripts allowed him to interact with the .NET framework, load access databases, and create unattended installation routines. This early exposure to automation and the realization that manual processes were inefficient set the stage for his later interest in immutable infrastructure and containerization.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Gaming Origins and the Rise of Docker\nThe shift into infrastructure engineering was heavily influenced by De Smet's interest in gaming. Around 2013, he attempted to run Counter-Strike: Global Offensive servers in Vietnam. He discovered that running game servers in traditional virtual machines led to significant performance degradation. This challenge led him to explore Linux containers and Docker as a more efficient alternative. He began building a gaming platform that required ingesting massive amounts of log data to generate player statistics, similar to professional platforms like ESEA. He utilized IRC bots and regular expressions to parse logs and manage tournament flows. This project forced him to learn modern web technologies, including NodeJS, Python, and Angular. By attending local meetups in Vietnam, he transitioned from the Windows-centric world of ERP to the burgeoning ecosystem of Go, Docker, and immutable server architecture.\n\n[slide:3]\n## The Early Days of Kubernetes and CoreOS\nDe Smet was an early adopter of Kubernetes, following its announcement by Google in 2014. He initially viewed the system as overkill but was fascinated by the kubelet's ability to manage containers. He documented the \"hard way\" of setting up Kubernetes on Digital Ocean droplets, which involved manually bootstrapping PKI, configuring etcd, and setting up Flannel for overlay networking. He highlights the significance of CoreOS during this era, particularly its container-centric operating system and the Fleet scheduler. He describes the technical competition between Docker and CoreOS, noting how CoreOS developed Rocket (rkt) to address security concerns like image signing and verification. This period was marked by rapid innovation and shifting standards, as Kubernetes eventually superseded alternative schedulers like Fleet and Docker Swarm. De Smet notes that while CoreOS was eventually acquired by Red Hat, its influence on the industry remains through projects like ignition and the concept of automated OS updates.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Infrastructure Trade-offs and Resource Management\nThe discussion explores the practical trade-offs between using Kubernetes and managed services like AWS Fargate. De Smet argues that while Fargate offers simplicity, it lacks the fine-grained control over resource oversubscription that Kubernetes provides. In Kubernetes, engineers can oversubscribe nodes, allowing pods to burst and utilize available memory and CPU beyond their guaranteed limits, which is essential for handling bury workloads cost-effectively. He notes that *the reason developers like to run docker compose is because it's easy almost no dials and knobs* but emphasizes that enterprise-scale infrastructure requires more robust controls. He discusses the evolution of ECS and the recent introduction of managed autoscaling groups, highlighting that the choice of tool depends on the specific business value and operational requirements of the organization. This understanding of trade-offs led him to develop Grid, a tool designed to manage infrastructure state with stronger type safety than traditional methods.\n\n[slide:5]\n## AI-Driven Development and Task Management\nDe Smet provides a detailed look at his current development process, which heavily utilizes AI agents like SpecKit and Beads. He describes a \"spec-driven\" approach where he uses AI to plan features, perform gap analysis, and generate functional requirements in Markdown. He highlights the challenges of managing massive AI-generated task lists, which can grow to thousands of lines. To solve this, he uses Beads, a tool that tracks tasks in a database rather than a flat file, allowing for better context management and issue linking. He explains how he uses different AI models for specific tasks: Gemini for reviewing code and plans due to its speed and large context window, and Claude for the actual implementation. This workflow allows him to \"slice and dice\" complex features into manageable issues with clear acceptance criteria. He emphasizes that the planning phase is critical, often taking up the majority of the development time to ensure the AI agent has sufficient context to execute correctly.\n\n[slide:6]\n## The Grid Project and Strongly Typed State\nThe final segment focuses on \"Grid,\" De Smet's project for managing infrastructure state. Grid is designed to solve the problems associated with \"integration registries\" in large organizations, where different teams need to share infrastructure outputs like VPC IDs or subnet IDs. Unlike existing solutions that rely on loosely typed strings, Grid aims to provide strongly typed schemas for infrastructure outputs using Terra Constructs. This allows for better contract testing between teams and ensures that dependencies are versioned and validated. De Smet demonstrates the Grid API and dashboard, showing how it tracks dependencies between different Terraform states. The system can detect when a dependency becomes \"stale\" due to changes in an upstream resource. He explains that Grid uses state as an encapsulation mechanism, allowing platform teams to expose specific resources to product teams without revealing the underlying complexity. The project is built using Go and Connect RPC, providing autogenerated clients for multiple languages and a React-based visualization layer."
