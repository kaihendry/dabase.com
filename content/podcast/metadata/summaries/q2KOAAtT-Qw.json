    "content": "Transcript:\nWelcome everybody.\nIt's it's Vincent and I just chatting\nabout infrastructure and AI and uh what\nwhat what what's fun and cool I suppose.\nUm Vincent, you you wanted to show me\nsomething. I I know you've been itching.\nStraight on to the demo. Yeah, I can. Um\ngive me a minute. I'll cut this out.\n>> Are you on Are you on Mac? cuz the\n>> Yeah, I am.\n>> Okay.\n>> It's It follows me. It\n>> You got center stage enabled.\n>> Yeah. I have no idea. It just works,\nright?\n>> Sorry, I have to uh plug some I have a\npump. My AC pump. My AC is um in a funny\nposition and it needs to pump the water\nout up. So, there's a pump, but the pump\nis a bit dodgy.\n>> What's your temperature there? It looks\nlike you're sweaty. And\n>> yeah, I went to the gym this morning. So\nit is it is quite hot here.\n>> Yeah. Uh but I did so that's another\nthat's a great thing about AI but and\nthose budgets of AI by the way because I\nhit my budget like I have a 5 hour\nsession and then I hit my budget maybe\nin two hours and so then I have 3 hours\nto go to the gym, right? I mean the\namount of work I get done in two hours\nis is pretty much the same what I what I\nwould do in a day. So it's pretty great.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, I I never thought about like\nthat, but yeah, like I'm a big fan of\nlike uh being careful with your time and\nyou know the Pomodoro technique where\nyou just jam in stuff. So if is\n>> So is the AI spend limit or Claude\nworking the same way? Which plan are you\non again?\n>> I'm on the like the lowest paid plan 20\nbucks around Codex and Cloud.\n>> Sorry. Oh, and it and it basically works\nby by time. Like if you smashing your\nyour token,\n>> the moment you send your first message,\na 5 hour session starts\n>> and then you get a certain token budget\nwithin those 5 hours depending on your\nplan. And so it will remind you now they\nadded like a nice usage command since\nthey did sonet 4.5 last week and cloud\ncode version two. So they added a lot\nmore um context management and\nnotifications about your usage um when\nand and also they added more I think\nthey enforcing the weekly limits\nstronger and um basically\nwithin 5 hours you have a budget you\nkeep track of how it's going so I can\nsee like oh I'm at 50% let me maybe do a\nlittle bit more myself instead of just\nasking cloud to do it or or like um\nswitch over to Codeex which often do.\nUm, so that\n>> I I tried Codeex I think after you\ntalking about it and it is a lot better\nexperience than I remember.\n>> Yeah, it has improved a lot but I don't\nuse the CLI. Uh although that the CLI\nnow recently has been updated as well.\nIt's a little bit better. But the the\nIDE plugin, you know, lets you paste in\nimages, reference well, you can\nreference files on both sides. But I\nfind the I the IDE um plugin quite nice\nin uh in codeex because I can, you know,\nput it on full agent mode and it seems\nto use its tools and utility like better\nlike when it needs to edit a file.\n>> Maybe you should show share the screen.\nshow show it perhaps\n>> I think cuz that would be more\ninteresting for people. Okay,\nso this is a project that I've been\nworking on since the last time we talked\nwhere we talked about some of the events\nhappening around Terraform states and\nstate management open tacos announcement\nand I've talked to those people and I\nwanted to get some features in but I\nhave not been able to reach them and so\nI started decided like it can't be that\nhard right I even commented on one guy\nlike he posted like oh when you start a\nnew project it's so exciting because you\nget to make a text tech decisions and\nthen maybe you will regret those and I\nsaid like well cloud will oneshot it\nanyway so who cares\nso I I I thought if I I talk big like\nthat let me try it right let me see if I\ncan oneot this thing\n>> I'm I'm curious to see what's in your\nclaw directory in your codeex which is\njust session management or something\n>> so this is what spec this is speckit um\nspeckit gives you a command to bootstrap\na repository to use speckit this kind of\nfunny Now because cloud code uh has\nannounced plug-in marketplace so you can\nlook at specit like a plug-in market\nsorry like a like a marketplace plug-in\nit comes with a bunch of commands\nbasically prompt templates a bunch of\nscripts and um yeah that's pretty much\nit like it uses templates for some uh\nspecification files that you may want to\nbuild. So, so this cloud folder here\nthat has these commands, this is all\nprepared by specit.\n>> Oh, I see. So, it just So, what's a\ncommand then? It's like a it's like a\nprompt.\n>> I will try. Hold on. Um I I I want to\nopen the the specit website. Yeah. So,\num a command is like a prepared prompt.\nIt can have arguments. So you can call\nthose you know like when you do slash\nyou can um call those like analyze.\n>> Yes. So then you all of your files that\nyou put in here under the commands\nfolder will show up as slashcomands in\nyour cloud code and you can also have\narguments.\n>> Do do you use that a lot? I mean do you\nactually\n>> speckit is completely built around this\nworkflow. So I've never used it until I\nuse specit. So you basically I mean so\nyou find yourself going analyze clarify\nconstitution whatever that means in plan\n>> I don't know I've never used kro but the\nidea let me go spec kit let me open the\nwebsite of spec kit the idea of\nspecdriven development is to basically\ncapture the reasoning behind code\nbecause they say rightfully so that the\ncode itself is no long is never hold on\nI'm going to open this\nThey have a website here somewhere.\nUh anyway,\nwhere is the\nthe ideology behind it? Hold on, let me\nfind that\nspec driven development.\n>> Right. So, so the the whole idea behind\nspecket which is the code was never\nreally the secret sauce like before um\nbasically people delivered code and the\ncode is what represents the business\nlogic documentation outdates becomes\noutdated very quickly but with LLM\ndriven workflows the code becomes more\nof like an after like an artifact\nsomething that gets produced and you\nquickly like factor it or throw it away\nand what's more important is your\nspecifications and the test suites built\naround\nRight.\n>> Specs and test suites. I I fully agree\nthat sounds really good.\n>> So, so the power of inversion like this\nthis this explanation is really good to\nread up front to understand really why\nit matters and why it is really worth it\nto do it that way. Definitely if you\nworked like like my previous workflow\nbefore speckit was I spend time with\nchipt on the web interface or in my\nphone when I'm in bed or when I'm\nwalking around thinking about ideas and\ntrying to understand how to use certain\ntechnology in some of my projects\non on that note like um how do you\ncapture your ideas that you have\nspontaneously like I to be honest I I\ntry use voice recording\nand just cap try capture like me, you\nknow, in the middle of the night saying\ndo this workflow. Uh, and then I often\nforget about it like but do you have a\nbetter way of sort of capturing ideas\nand stuff?\n>> So, Chat GPT now has this feature where\nyou can create folders. So, I've been\nworking on this this well has probably\nbeen there for a while, but I've been\nusing this feature to create folders\nmore more aggressively. And yeah,\nsometimes I just tap the the dictate um\nand I just, you know, dictate what I'm\nthinking.\n>> Uh for example,\n>> that that works from the mobile, I guess\nyou must do.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But you can do it on on your\nlaptop as well. I started using uh\ndictate on my my MacBook. Although that\nthe transcription is not as good as if\nyou use uh in the app because in the app\nI think it uses the LLM to trans\ntranscribe. So um so here I was\nliterally uh in my in my bedroom and I\nsaid what's data without a schema? You\nknow what's worse is data that used to\nhave a schema but the schema is gone.\nAnd here I'm talking about how my idea\nof like capturing the TypeScript um\nschema on top of the Terraform state\ngives you more of structured information\nabout the actual Terraform\ninfrastructure as code. Right? So, this\nwas all spoken in and transcribed by the\nLLM and then it says like, okay, and I\nsay, hey, help me create a launch uh\nsite and it kind of captures like some\nof the hooks that we want to put on\nthere, right? But as you can see, I have\na lot of like ideas and chats and it's\nvery hard for me to find back some of\nthese ideas. Um, sometimes like I know I\ndiscussed something somewhere, it's\nsomewhere in in one of these chats. The\nworst is after I've like done a drill\ndown into\n>> So, you can't you can't search through\nthem or something like that. You can you\ncan search through this but I don't know\nit's I I still I I have discussed the\nsame thing so many times because it\nbecomes uh you know when you do a\ndictation you discuss something and\nmaybe you're building on something that\nyou had um discussed before uh but\nbasically it's lost somewhere in these\nchats. So with specit\num I feel like I do this in a much more\nstructured way. So before speckit I had\nthese chats I had to somehow capture all\nof these different responses from chatpt\npick out the bits that I liked remove\nthe bits that I didn't like and then\ncreate uh a document to to to\nbasically track what I'm trying to do.\nSo with specitate that starts with like\na user description. So the first step is\nto to do specify the specify command is\nto to to kick off the workflow. So user\na user description is that like a use\ncase or is it something else?\n>> Yeah, that that's that's the hardest\nthing to to know about specit is like\nwhat do I exactly say in at each uh step\nof the way. So they do have a very good\nexample on their readme. Um there's like\na detailed walk through detailed process\nwhere um they go through like the first\nthing okay once you've initialized your\nrepository and it is copied over your\ncloud commands into your git repository\nand it set everything up for you. You\ncan choose codeex, you can choose cloud,\nyou can use github copilot because this\nis a Microsoft product. And um they also\nchanged like now now they have a prefix\nonto each slash command. Um I I have not\ntalked about the constitution.\n>> Sorry Vincent you is this a Microsoft\nproduct? Did you say\n>> it's a GitHub right? GitHub is from\nMicrosoft.\n>> Oh okay. Okay.\n>> Yes. So so so the first thing is in this\nexample here like you need to do a\nfunctional specification not the the\nclarification you need to start on the\nactual spec project specification right.\nSo that's the first thing you do you do\nspecify um and that's after you've done\nconstitution. So I will talk more about\nconstitution later but first you have to\ncome up with like a prompt of what we're\ngoing to develop. You ask me what is\nthis thing that you're putting in. Uh be\nas explicit as possible about what\nyou're trying to build and why. Don't\ntalk about tech. Don't say like I want\nthe Golang uh monolithic application or\nwhatever. No, you're talking purely\nabout what you're going to develop at\nthat point. And so the great thing is\nonce you've kicked off this this initial\nprompt um it's going to come up with a\nbunch of like what's the user scenario\nwhat are the usea like what are the\npersonas um if when like user stories it\nbasically follows a template um to\n>> so it creates the use cases for you what\nreally\n>> yeah so the specify argument basically\nruns a script to create new feature\nwhich will then set up a new get branch.\nSo when you use spec specify to to\ninitialize your repo or your project\nfolder, it will create a git repo and\nthen you set up the constitution which I\nwill talk about later and then you say I\nwant to create a new feature. It sets up\na new branch for that feature and\nprepares a spec folder. So everything is\norganized. It's like um ADR on on\nsteroids or LLM driven ADR. Are you\nfamiliar with ADR?\n>> Uh yeah. Yeah. We I use them my work uh\narchitecture\nuh decision record, right?\n>> Yes. uh it's architecture decision\nrecords the same thing you run a command\nand you create a decision record\nmarkdown and then you walk through it\nwith your colleagues and then you lock\nit in right\n>> it's the same thing here um you're doing\nADR but it's all driven through LLMs so\nthe LLM is asked to run a script\n>> but this is but the uh vocabulary here\nis a feature right you call ADR is a\nfeature here\n>> I guess so I I I I've only read about\nADR I've always wanted to use it uh and\nthen I started using speckit and I was\nlike oh that's probably what ADR\nWell, I see ADR maybe I'm doing it\nwrong, but I see it more of a as a post\nactivity like a like a documentation\nthing like you've worked some options uh\nand this is why you went with this\noption you know.\n>> Yeah. But when I tried to contribute to\nAtlantis, they uh they just adopted ADR\nand they asked me to before I started\nanything create the actual you know\nproposal of what I'm going to build like\nthe feature what I'm going to build and\nand how I'm going to build it and where\nI'm going to make changes so that they\ncould agree uh with me first if this was\nthe way that they they wanted the\nproject to evolve uh for my feature to\nget a better chance to get it uh\naccepted. Right. And I I think in open\nsource that's kind of how you use ADR.\nWell, I always think the other way\naround like I I think you need to have\ncode otherwise you don't have an ADR\nreally. You need to have an\nimplementation. You need to because\nbecause you know you can you can propose\nthe moon on a stick but does it even\nwork? You'll never know.\n>> I think you don't Yeah, sure. You you\nmust have some type of credibility in in\nthe changes that you're proposing. But\nfor example, for me, I spend maybe a day\nor two reading the Atlantis source code\nand then identifying a couple of areas\nwhere I think the feature should impact\nand and then I can put my ADR in before\nI write the code to get like a a sanity\ncheck from the project maintainers,\nright? Like I'm saying I'm going to\nbuild this feature and I believe I need\nto change these code paths and they may\nvery quickly flag well actually that\ncode path kind of deprecated. um more of\nthe of the logic that you're looking at\nlives there and and we can get that\nright first. Right.\n>> Okay. I I guess I guess to be honest\nit's it is a better attack cuz early\nearly fast feedback is is a principle\nuh I also live by but uh if this project\ndoes it then then go for it I suppose.\n>> Yeah. So in my case with the Atlantic\nsituation I was like great I get to\ncreate my first ADR. I'll do it next\nweek. And then next week never happened.\nSo um anyway with specit I I was very\nmotivated with due to the recent events\nto to like really try out um how this\ncould like work and without specit this\nis what I came up with like I come with\nthe product requirement definition. I\ncreated like a V1 of what I want. I want\nthe API to look like this and then a V2\na little bit updated after more chat GPT\nchats and then I asked uh cloud go ahead\nand and did it and and cloud was very\nenthusiastic. Um it always goes like\nperfect amazing the test pass\neverything's great but nothing worked\nlike nothing worked together.\n>> Okay. So this is your this was your\nfirst way. Okay. Okay.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. This was my first way. So I\nwent into chat uh did a bunch of chats\ntried to uh you know consolidate it into\nlike a a product requirement document\ntried to capture all of the things that\nI wanted repository layout\n>> because I because I guess you went tech\nfirst here and maybe specitate is the\nother way. I I have so this is the the\nbig thing I learned about speckit is\nlike I I never really did proper product\num development and I didn't have all of\nthese users scenarios and all and edge\ncases thought out I this way like I can\ndo it for very small things like I want\nto build a terapform provider I want to\nbuild a small binary I want to build a\nterminal user interface I can even\nterminal user interface start to get a\nlittle bit dodgy but like because cloud\nis so good at like being being creative\nit kind of works like oh great cloud\ncame up with all this additional stuff\nthat I never asked for, but because the\nproject was small enough, it actually\nworked. It was able to complete it, for\nexample. But once you start hitting like\na big project where you have many moving\nparts that need to lift to like work\ntogether and and then you have\nassumptions on the left and assumptions\non the right and nothing works together,\n>> right?\n>> So, so that's where specit is really\ngreat. Um because and I there was a\nthread earlier on on Reddit about that I\njust read earlier on Reddit um which was\na way to capture the like in a monor\nrepo to capture the meaning of each\ndirectory because when you want to make\nchanges in a monor repo there's\ndefinitely responsibilities that live in\ncertain parts and if you unleash an an\nLLM it will just like try to do\neverything in one area and then\n>> you know duplicate the logic. So this is\nI I mean I I like the owners uh\nparadigm. I mean to be honest I don't\nwork on projects with that many owners\nto be honest. Uh but the the a the I\nlike the um the agent markdown is is\nquite cool because you can sprinkle them\nin in your in your code hierarchy. Um\n>> okay. Yeah. So you could you could\ncapture a bit more like don't do this\nhere. If you need to change let's go\nover there.\n>> I suppose\n>> but it's tedious to maintain it right.\nSo, so what is the approach here for for\nlike\n>> okay so so so the Reddit thread was\nmentioning we they they iterate on an\nidea and then after 20 messages back and\nforth the context kind of grows and then\nover time the LLM when it actually\nstarts implementing it to totally loses\ntrack of where things are supposed to go\nlike you said you can like manually\nmaintain agent files across your\nrepository the way that specit\napproaches this is when you get down to\nthe actual task generation it's very\nspecific specific about where you're\ngoing to change what and why. So every\nsingle task that the LLM works on has\nvery detailed like all self-contained\ninformation. Like\nthat's at the very end and and I'm\ntelling you specit takes me like easily\ntwo five hour sessions. So easily like\ntwo hours per session. So 4 hours at\nleast to get it to the point before I\neven start to write code which is very\nfrustrating when you start because\nyou're so used to you know jump into\ncloud and have it generate a whole bunch\nof code and now you have to like go\nthrough all of these edge cases you know\nreview the functional requirements you\nknow do research and then align the plan\nand the research against those\nfunctional requirements and validate it\nand and and the first time my first\nfeature which is like the start like\nbootstrap the mon repo and build some\nbasic functionality\nit I totally like yes yes yes yes okay\nyes next on the first few steps because\nI also didn't even know what like most\nof those steps were meant to do um and\nand so I I ran up the the implementation\npart became very painful because specit\ndivides it and you you specify the\nfeature you you know start to formulate\na plan where you actually define what is\nthe text stack that you want to use that\ngets you know does some research to find\nout more about the libraries that you're\ninteracting with and how they integrate\nwith each\nUm and then once you've got the\nresearch, the plan, some data, models,\nthen you start to generate the tasks and\nthen you go through a couple of\niterations of actually analyzing very\nvery carefully how those functional\nrequirements map back to those tasks and\nif everything is like covered in terms\nof like um requirements and and and\n>> and I did like like I said the first\ntime I completely ignored that iteration\nand I went straight into implementation\nand halfway through I realized I made a\nbig mistake. and like half of the code\nwas actually not not quite right and I\nhad to go back and try to make changes\nand I found it a bit hard to like uh\nadjust the course at that point because\nI hadn't done the a lot of the research\nup front and of course\n>> the idea is like how can I know that\nI've got everything right from the start\nright um you can't but\n>> um with this approach now with like\nreally going into a lot of the edge\ncases the the feature that I did last\ntime which was like adding\num labels on terraform states literally\nI think two days to get the specs right\nand then I went to sleep at like 9:00\np.m. Ask cloud to start implementing\nmaybe woke up around like midnight to\nask codeex to review and continue the\nimplementation and then by morning 7:00\na.m. kicked off another final\nimplementation round and by lunch it was\nfully implemented and it hadn't\nencountered any issues and I went\nstraight into the UI and it worked and\nit was like holy crazy.\n>> So this is really interesting. So\n>> what you said there where you got clawed\nto kick off the implementation.\nUm is is that like a specit thing to\nlike you know specit implement? Okay.\n>> Yes.\nAnd then is it also a spec kit thing to\nlike get codeex another model to review\nit?\n>> Uh not not explicitly but they do say\nthat it's an interactive process. So\nthey give you these starter commands to\ncreate those documents and you're they\nalso say like don't expect this like\n>> um don't expect the first response to be\nwhat you want right you must actually\nvalidate and go through it. Um and then\nyou know the first thing is after it\nwent through this prompt it will then\nhave a couple of needs clarification. It\nwill generate edge cases like you may\nsay here they talk about task taskify a\nteam productivity platform should allow\nusers to create projects and then it\nwill create like um clarification\nquestions like what if two users create\nthis project with the same name like\nwhat what happens because you haven't\nclarified that right what if the user\ndeletes a project that is um has a lot\nof tasks assigned to it how like is\nthere a delete cascade in the background\nlike how does that work so you have to\ngo through a lot of these um details.\n>> Well, okay. So, this this sounds great.\nAbsolutely great for like bootstrapping\na project. But what what happens if you\nthe uh just out of interest if there was\nan existing project like say you have an\nexisting project and you want to\nspecitify it? Is that possible?\n>> They do have a section about introducing\nit on existing projects. I have to say\nlike this YouTube video here on the on\nthe on the root p on the landing page or\nthe root rate me it takes you to the\nchannel of of one of the main advocates\nbehind it and if you look at his posts\nfrom the like his YouTube videos from\nthe like week last week and literally I\nthink 3 days ago he did another update\nbecause they changed a couple of the\ncommands they added new command into it\nwhich is a checklist command for your um\nvalidation so you can validate that you\nhave really covered every area. Um, so,\nso these YouTube videos are amazing and\nhe does talk about like how to go and\nuse it into an existing project. Yeah, I\nthink this is when I talk to people that\nuse Ko, they say that this is very\nsimilar to Ko um but it's completely\nindependent from like a specific IDE,\nright? You it works with multiple uh LLM\nagents. It uses the CLI under the hood.\nSo, cloud is actually calling the cloud\nCLI to do some like summarizations and\nthings like that under the hood. So when\nyou mentioned Kira that that's uh sorry\nI I I not too sure what that means.\n>> Kirro is an AWS product that kind of\nlaunched the idea of specdriven\ndevelopment right they they really said\nlike people are using Almstrong uh the\nspecification is where you should start\nand they build a whole IDE around it.\nAh, so Speckit and Kirro, how are they\nrelated? Just\n>> not at all.\n>> They're not related. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So, so, so Kira is a commercial\nproduct from AWS. It's an ID with a\nsubscription with a subscription and\nthey use Sonale as well. Um, but they\nprovide you they have like nice little\nhooks inside the IDE. For example, if\nyou have a task, there's a little green\nbutton that appears around it. So, you\ncan click start implementing this task.\nand the LLM and start implementing it.\nThat's kind of like you see that that's\non the demo right now.\n>> Yeah. It's kind of like pretty cool.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. Because I mean Copilot has that,\nyou know, you can like save and\n>> Yeah. Or\n>> I I think I think the specit with GitHub\ncopilot does a similar thing, but I'm\nnot using GitHub copilot. I'm just using\nthe cloud code with because I'm used to\ncloud code. Yeah.\n>> Cool. Man, this is this is mind-blowing\nstuff, man. So, okay. So you got your\nspeck kit, you got your task breakdown,\nyou you kick it off overnight, you get\ncodeex to review it. So how do you kick\noff codeex by the way? Is it is it just\na like what you\n>> originally I always use the codeex ID on\nthe side here? So I just install the the\nthe plugin into in here. I need to\nupdate it I guess. Um so on one side I\nhave copilot the GitHub you know\nprovided. I have a seat uh provided by\norganization as well and then I have my\npersonal codeex here. um that I have\nthat I that is\nyeah that that's my codeex.\n>> Okay.\n>> I don't know what to say about it.\n>> So so your codeex is specified like how\ndo you know that it's like\n>> yeah so so codeex only supported prompt\narguments since last week. So the the\nspeckit has this argument at the start\nhere right the user input the user will\nprovide some input. So when you kick off\nthe command here um\nwhen you kick off specify yeah this is\nclassic cloud code doing the disco in\nthe terminal um so when you say like\nwe're we're we are going to revise the\nfiltering\nlibrary or something like that right I\ndon't know that's actually not a good\nspec because it should not be related to\nthe there's no functional requirement\nthere's no that's just pure tech that's\na really that spec actually. Okay, it\nshould really be about like the user\nfiltering experience is bad. Uh the\nperform like when a user clicks the\nfilter it takes you know minutes before\nthe result appears and then it will\ngenerate user stories and edge cases and\nlike what are the benchmarks that we\nneed to create what are the tests to\nvalidate that that it is implemented\ncorrectly and then we can go into the\ntechnical research like okay we find\nsome hot pots we need to add some\nindexes into the database and do things\nlike that. So that would be in the in\nthe plan phase. So specify the first\nphase you say the functional requirement\nwhy do you need to do this what you want\nto do exactly. Then you do plan where it\nwill kick off um several documents and\nand no actually before sorry before you\ngo into plan um the specify will have\ngenerated edge cases and will have\nquestions like what happens if uh if\nthis or that right and then it will ask\nyou clarification about how do you want\nto handle those like are you okay with\nthis um and when you click up and for\nthat also there's there's um an LLM\nprompt which will basically go through\nthe document find any areas that needs\nclarification and then give you three or\nfour options on how you may want to\naddress this. So there's a question\noption A, B or C. So because we all use\nNLM ultimately to answer those\nquestions, right? Yeah, I don't really\nI'm not really sure like what are some\nof the common ways that I could solve\nthis and suspect it will give you like\nthree or four uh clarification options\nthere and then you can\n>> so but going back to codec soc.\nSo you basically run some commands in\nclaude and you run uh the same sort of\ncommands in in codeex alternately.\n>> Yeah. So codec since last week has these\narguments. So I I I started using the\nCLI and what I noticed is that the CLI\nin CEX never wants to execute the\nscripts. Maybe this is some training\nthat OpenAI did to prevent like uh\nprompt injection attacks because there's\nbeen a few. So, so Codex even if the\nprompt says you will run this script, it\ndoesn't run the script. So, so now I'm\nlike confirm to me you will run this\nparticular script and that works and it\nsays yes I will run it and then actually\nwhen I say\n>> um I I I trigger the prompt. So you see\nthe prompt was expanded here. So I call\nthe prompt command and then it says user\ninput is here. We need to identify\nactually I left the user input blank it\nlooks like. Um I also noticed that if I\nput too much codeex will just lose half\nthe prompt. I don't know. So maybe I\nstopped putting\n>> prompts. So on the subject of security,\nI'm not going to lie, when I use Claude,\nI sometimes specify, you know, skip\ndangerously skip permissions because I\nhate having to uh, you know, press\nenter.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So do you have a different approach to\nto security?\n>> Uh, depends on what repository I work\non. If it's my own that I just\nbootstrapped, I'm okay with like most of\nit. Yeah.\n>> So you just skip all the permissions.\n>> I don't run MCPS or barely any because I\nbelieve that MCPS pollute the uh context\nwindow and the context window is scarce.\nSo I try to keep as much of the context\nwindow free and so I only one MCP. Now\n>> on on the on the subject of context\nwindow like um I do think the\ninteraction with MCP is quite good\nbecause it tells you when it runs the\ntool. It tells you what the input is and\nthe output. Um, at least with Claude,\nit's quite clear to me, but like to me\nto me like a lot of these prompt\nprompting things,\nuh, I mean, they're quite verbose. I\nmean, like when you when you're running\nthese commands, are you actually viewing\nall the input? Are you like like do you\nhave a a finger on the whole context\nwindow or do you letting it do its\nthing?\n>> It depends. Like I used to be very\nhands-on with the implementation phase.\nDefinitely when I wasn't going very\ndetailed with like all the educations\nand functional requirements I started I\nrealized I need to stop it to do the\nwrong thing. However like the last\nfeature that I let it implement like\nliterally I went to sleep. So I after I\nfeel a lot more confident about the I\nran the validate process like four times\nliterally I think I use 50 I think at\nthis point I use almost like 40% of my\nweekly token budget just on spec\ngeneration and and and like validation\nof the specs and then the actual\nimplementation takes 30% or so. Yeah.\n>> Wow. So, and then your spec um what is\nthe source of truth there? Like it's is\nit sitting in in a markdown file\nsomewhere?\n>> Yeah. So, that's a that's a pattern I\ndid before specit as well because cloud\nis great when you first start start\nusing cloud. You go like let's go in\nplan mode and create a bunch of to-dos\nand then it ticks nicely through those\nto-dos. If you get stuck on something,\nyou can like re like help it, you can\nnudge it along. You're following along\nand all that, right? But very quickly\nwhen the projects gets bigger, you you\nident you realize that those to-dos like\nthey're sometimes based on\nmisconceptions or or you run out of\ncontext and then you need to compact and\nthen the compact summary throws away a\nlot of the stuff that you originally was\npart of the reasons why the to-dos\nexisted. So so those to-dos don't scale\nand so I started say asking cloud like\nokay check off the things that you've\ncompleted like when it started\napproaching context window limits and\nwrite it down for handover. I call it\nlike we need to hand over to someone,\nright? So, write everything down into a\nmarkdown. Um, and then I would open a a\nnew cloud session. Well, I didn't know\nhow to use the clear comp um command\nproperly, but I used a new cloud window\nand then I would just like read the\nhandover document. Um, there's a couple\nof to-dos there.\n>> There's there's a command called\ncompact, right? I think you\n>> Yes, but I found that the compact throws\naway like too many details. definitely\nsome of the initial research that you've\ndone and some of the reasoning why the\nto-dos exists and then if you you know\nhalfway through are going down the wrong\npath and then the original you know\nlogic is gone then the to-dos no longer\nmakes sense and then cloud starts to be\nvery creative and then it nothing works\nanymore. So that's why I already had\nthis this experience um of of throwing\naway contexts easily and that's\nsomething that people say like\n>> you know your context is like a jewel\nyou need to craft it very right to get\nit into the right you know data that you\nwant and actually cloud added a lot of\ncommands for you like the double escape\nif you are uh on cloud you can double\ndouble escape and you can rewind back to\none of the previous like context\nsnapshots or something like that\n>> I didn't know that\n>> res and you can even this one actually\ndouble escape is restore the code or\nconversation from a point before. This\nis something\n>> escape. Wow, I knew about I just learned\nabout shift tab I think. I think is it\nshift tab?\n>> Yeah, shift tab. Shift tab is like the\nthe amazing experience when you first\nstart using cloud code like because you\nactually get to you know determine the\nplan and the to-dos before you start\nwriting down anything, right? But again\nlike the plan mode hits it limit when\nyou start building right large\nrepositories. And so that's where, you\nknow, writing things down into a\nmarkdown for handover really helps. And\nthen specit um really formalizes that\nworkflow because it really puts in like\nfirst we're going to get the functional\nrequirements, then we're going to go\nthrough it and we're going to eliminate\nanything that needs clarification. It's\nliterally one of the checkboxes. If you\ntry to run the plan command or the plan\nprompt, normally cloud will see the\ninstruction that if there's anything\nthat still needs clarification, abort\nstraight back to the user. You need to\ngo clarify. Wow. Yeah,\n>> but the funny thing is it's LLMs, right?\nSo, so when I do this with codecs,\nsometimes it sees this and just goes\nlike, \"Yeah, whatever.\" And just keeps\ngoing. It's like, \"Come on, man. There's\nIt's right there. Don't continue if\nthere's still items to be clarified.\"\n>> Sorry if I asked you this question\nbefore, but how did you come across Spec\nKit?\n>> Um, how did I come across it?\n>> Like hacker news or something?\n>> No, I'm I'm I'm on like a lot of\nReddits. I'm on cloud code Reddit, on\nentropic, on the OpenAI Reddit, like the\nsubreddits, I mean, and I think it was\nposted there. I definitely saw all of\nthe like on the AWS subreddit about Ko.\nI read a lot about specri development. I\ndidn't I was building something at the\ntime with cloud code and I was quite\nhappy the way it was going. But it\ndefinitely resonated with me because I\nwas doing already those handover\ndocuments basically define what needs to\nbe developed. I just didn't realize how\nhow detailed the process was. Um\n>> because yeah so so what what you asked\nme earlier is like how does this\nactually work on an existing project and\nwhen you need to like adopt things I I\ndon't know\n>> okay\n>> because I I started from scratch but I\nam using it on a large project right now\nand it is able to add in new features\nquite\n>> I think we're bouncing around a bit like\nI I still don't actually understand\nwhere your your specs live. They just\nlive in the specs folder there.\n>> Okay. So, so the first step is you\nspecify what you're trying to build, why\nyou're trying to build it, and then it\nwill when you kick off that pro prompt,\nit will create a branch and it will\ncreate a folder in the specs directory.\nAnd so then you're working on a branch\non that specific feature, right? So this\nis one of the things people mention on\nReddit is like how does this scale\nacross a team like how do you keep track\nof like multiple people and their spec\nbranches? So I also don't know that like\nthis is a question that my colleague\nasked me when I I showed it to him. um\nlike how will this like do you have\neveryone working on their own spec\nbranches and so on? How do you\ncollaborate on these branches?\n>> Um because it's going to be\n>> I can't answer those questions.\n>> If it's a fastmoving project, it might\nbe a real pain to to merge, right?\n>> There might be a lot of different uh so\nso I think that's one important thing.\nAside from the agents, there's the\nconstellation uh which is part of the\nmemory. So it creates a dot. So on one\nside it creates your commands under your\ncloud or your agent. So it has the\nprepared prompts there. Then it creates\na special specify folder where it has\nthe templates. For example, when it\nneeds to write a new spec, it it has a\nvery detailed plan template. So again,\nthis is kind of like one shot or nshot\nLLM usage where you tell it like look at\nthis and now replicate it. Now look at\nthis then followed my example. Follow my\nexample. Right? So it say read this then\ndo this. Read this then do this. Right?\nSo it it follows cloud is great. It\nfollows this structure really really\nwell. Codeex sometimes gives you a\ncompletely different template like\ncompletely nothing like it and sometimes\nchip 5 just\n>> what do you mean\n>> very nicely follows it.\n>> It like it doesn't read\n>> it doesn't follow it. I don't know why\nSona is doing a great job but uh that's\nwhy that's why I have very dedicated\nlike if I want\n>> so so what is doing a good job? Sonai\n>> sonet son um is a French way to say\nsonet uh\n>> sonet means a tune or doesn't it or like\na\n>> it's a it's a type of pros I think like\nif you write\n>> son\n>> okay yeah\n>> so I'm going to I'm going to be I'm\ngoing to say this is a French word\noriginally right\n>> yeah just like\n>> proson\n>> uh\nso you're using four you're using 4.5 I\nmean when it comes to model choices is\nare you quite are you picky about it? Do\nyou go son for the 4.5?\nSo this is the thing right these things\nchange so fast um that's why I also\navoid MCPS and other stuff like I trust\nthem to provide the best working\nenvironment I cannot keep up with it so\nwhen they say use Sony 4.5 I'll be okay\nand they and uh and and that's the thing\nwhere a lot of people last week were\nvery upset and because they are kind of\ntelling people not to use opus and they\nmake you blow your budget if you use\nopus they charge it double right they\nreally want people to use Sonet and\npeople are like oh Son is not as good as\nOpus blah blah blah but\n>> they really craft code and the context\nand the tooling everything around the\nmodel and they're saying really don't\nuse don't use sorry don't use opus so\n>> that's good to hear because like I had\nlike some FOMO that I'm just not using\nmaking\n>> the right choices but I it has it has to\nbe auto going forward I mean it's\n>> I agree like it's it's a full-time job\nlike I watch some YouTube channels like\ngo coder who very frequently breaks down\nhe has his own benchmark um where he\nsays okay I've tested Quen I've tested\nGLM I've tested JGPT OSS uh for local\nLLMs um and and he goes into great\ndetail and I used to like wait until\nmade a video to actually figure out is\nthere like an improvement is there a\nsignificant improvement in his benchmark\nthat would justify me to spend time to\nplay with it and and I've actually\nstarted um I mean at some point you just\nwant to get the worked on. You don't\nhave the time to just keep reading about\nall the LLMs and\n>> cuz cuz every time there's like, oh,\nactually you need to use XML now. Yeah,\nyou you should pro you write your prom.\nOh, actually YAML is much better. Oh,\nno, no, JSON is the way.\n>> I'm sure you're making some crazy\nexamples there. Anyway, I I think\n>> No, no, that's real. That's real like\nReddit posts about this is my JSON\n>> formatted. Yes. No, it's not a\n>> that's like that's like a virus. Like\nyou start using XML and then uh\nheadache. Yeah.\n>> Um\nOh, I think you g I think you gave me at\nleast a very good overview of uh spec\nkit there. So maybe maybe we should we\nshould go back to to uh the value add on\nTerraform.",

I I know you've been itching.\n[0:18] Straight on to the demo. Yeah, I can. Um\n[0:24] give me a minute. I'll cut this out.\n[0:27] >> Are you on Are you on Mac? cuz the\n[0:29] >> Yeah, I am.\n[0:30] >> Okay.\n[0:30] >> It's It follows me. It\n[0:32] >> You got center stage enabled.\n[0:34] >> Yeah. I have no idea. It just works,\n[0:37] right?\n[0:38] >> Sorry, I have to uh plug some I have a\n[0:41] pump. My AC pump. My AC is um in a funny\n[0:45] position and it needs to pump the water\n[0:47] out up. So, there's a pump, but the pump\n[0:50] is a bit dodgy.\n[0:52] >> What's your temperature there? It looks\n[0:53] like you're sweaty. And\n[0:56] >> yeah, I went to the gym this morning. So\n[0:58] it is it is quite hot here.\n[1:01] >> Yeah. Uh but I did so that's another\n[1:03] that's a great thing about AI but and\n[1:04] those budgets of AI by the way because I\n[1:06] hit my budget like I have a 5 hour\n[1:08] session and then I hit my budget maybe\n[1:10] in two hours and so then I have 3 hours\n[1:13] to go to the gym, right? I mean the\n[1:15] amount of work I get done in two hours\n[1:17] is is pretty much the same what I what I\n[1:20] would do in a day. So it's pretty great.\n[1:23] >> Yeah. Yeah, I I never thought about like\n[1:26] that, but yeah, like I'm a big fan of\n[1:28] like uh being careful with your time and\n[1:31] you know the Pomodoro technique where\n[1:33] you just jam in stuff. So if is\n[1:36] >> So is the AI spend limit or Claude\n[1:38] working the same way? Which plan are you\n[1:40] on again?\n[1:41] >> I'm on the like the lowest paid plan 20\n[1:44] bucks around Codex and Cloud.\n[1:47] >> Sorry. Oh, and it and it basically works\n[1:49] by by time. Like if you smashing your\n[1:52] your token,\n[1:53] >> the moment you send your first message,\n[1:55] a 5 hour session starts\n[1:58] >> and then you get a certain token budget\n[2:00] within those 5 hours depending on your\n[2:02] plan. And so it will remind you now they\n[2:05] added like a nice usage command since\n[2:07] they did sonet 4.5 last week and cloud\n[2:10] code version two. So they added a lot\n[2:12] more um context management and\n[2:15] notifications about your usage um when\n[2:19] and and also they added more I think\n[2:20] they enforcing the weekly limits\n[2:22] stronger and um basically\n[2:26] within 5 hours you have a budget you\n[2:29] keep track of how it's going so I can\n[2:31] see like oh I'm at 50% let me maybe do a\n[2:34] little bit more myself instead of just\n[2:36] asking cloud to do it or or like um\n[2:40] switch over to Codeex which often do.\n[2:42] Um, so that\n[2:43] >> I I tried Codeex I think after you\n[2:45] talking about it and it is a lot better\n[2:47] experience than I remember.\n[2:49] >> Yeah, it has improved a lot but I don't\n[2:51] use the CLI. Uh although that the CLI\n[2:54] now recently has been updated as well.\n[2:55] It's a little bit better. But the the\n[2:58] IDE plugin, you know, lets you paste in\n[3:00] images, reference well, you can\n[3:02] reference files on both sides. But I\n[3:04] find the I the IDE um plugin quite nice\n[3:09] in uh in codeex because I can, you know,\n[3:14] put it on full agent mode and it seems\n[3:16] to use its tools and utility like better\n[3:19] like when it needs to edit a file.\n[3:21] >> Maybe you should show share the screen.\n[3:23] show show it perhaps\n[3:25] >> I think cuz that would be more\n[3:27] interesting for people. Okay,\n[3:30] so this is a project that I've been\n[3:32] working on since the last time we talked\n[3:34] where we talked about some of the events\n[3:37] happening around Terraform states and\n[3:39] state management open tacos announcement\n[3:43] and I've talked to those people and I\n[3:45] wanted to get some features in but I\n[3:48] have not been able to reach them and so\n[3:50] I started decided like it can't be that\n[3:52] hard right I even commented on one guy\n[3:54] like he posted like oh when you start a\n[3:56] new project it's so exciting because you\n[3:58] get to make a text tech decisions and\n[3:59] then maybe you will regret those and I\n[4:01] said like well cloud will oneshot it\n[4:03] anyway so who cares\n[4:05] so I I I thought if I I talk big like\n[4:07] that let me try it right let me see if I\n[4:10] can oneot this thing\n[4:10] >> I'm I'm curious to see what's in your\n[4:12] claw directory in your codeex which is\n[4:14] just session management or something\n[4:17] >> so this is what spec this is speckit um\n[4:20] speckit gives you a command to bootstrap\n[4:23] a repository to use speckit this kind of\n[4:27] funny Now because cloud code uh has\n[4:29] announced plug-in marketplace so you can\n[4:32] look at specit like a plug-in market\n[4:34] sorry like a like a marketplace plug-in\n[4:37] it comes with a bunch of commands\n[4:39] basically prompt templates a bunch of\n[4:41] scripts and um yeah that's pretty much\n[4:45] it like it uses templates for some uh\n[4:48] specification files that you may want to\n[4:49] build. So, so this cloud folder here\n[4:52] that has these commands, this is all\n[4:55] prepared by specit.\n[4:57] >> Oh, I see. So, it just So, what's a\n[5:01] command then? It's like a it's like a\n[5:03] prompt.\n[5:05] >> I will try. Hold on. Um I I I want to\n[5:09] open the the specit website. Yeah. So,\n[5:12] um a command is like a prepared prompt.\n[5:15] It can have arguments. So you can call\n[5:18] those you know like when you do slash\n[5:21] you can um call those like analyze.\n[5:24] >> Yes. So then you all of your files that\n[5:28] you put in here under the commands\n[5:29] folder will show up as slashcomands in\n[5:31] your cloud code and you can also have\n[5:35] arguments.\n[5:36] >> Do do you use that a lot? I mean do you\n[5:38] actually\n[5:38] >> speckit is completely built around this\n[5:40] workflow. So I've never used it until I\n[5:43] use specit. So you basically I mean so\n[5:46] you find yourself going analyze clarify\n[5:48] constitution whatever that means in plan\n[5:52] >> I don't know I've never used kro but the\n[5:54] idea let me go spec kit let me open the\n[5:57] website of spec kit the idea of\n[6:00] specdriven development is to basically\n[6:03] capture the reasoning behind code\n[6:06] because they say rightfully so that the\n[6:09] code itself is no long is never hold on\n[6:12] I'm going to open this\n[6:16] They have a website here somewhere.\n[6:20] Uh anyway,\n[6:22] where is the\n[6:25] the ideology behind it? Hold on, let me\n[6:28] find that\n[6:32] spec driven development.\n[6:34] >> Right. So, so the the whole idea behind\n[6:37] specket which is the code was never\n[6:39] really the secret sauce like before um\n[6:42] basically people delivered code and the\n[6:44] code is what represents the business\n[6:46] logic documentation outdates becomes\n[6:48] outdated very quickly but with LLM\n[6:51] driven workflows the code becomes more\n[6:53] of like an after like an artifact\n[6:55] something that gets produced and you\n[6:57] quickly like factor it or throw it away\n[6:59] and what's more important is your\n[7:01] specifications and the test suites built\n[7:04] around\n[7:04] Right.\n[7:06] >> Specs and test suites. I I fully agree\n[7:08] that sounds really good.\n[7:10] >> So, so the power of inversion like this\n[7:12] this this explanation is really good to\n[7:14] read up front to understand really why\n[7:16] it matters and why it is really worth it\n[7:18] to do it that way. Definitely if you\n[7:20] worked like like my previous workflow\n[7:23] before speckit was I spend time with\n[7:26] chipt on the web interface or in my\n[7:29] phone when I'm in bed or when I'm\n[7:30] walking around thinking about ideas and\n[7:33] trying to understand how to use certain\n[7:35] technology in some of my projects\n[7:40] on on that note like um how do you\n[7:44] capture your ideas that you have\n[7:45] spontaneously like I to be honest I I\n[7:48] try use voice recording\n[7:49] and just cap try capture like me, you\n[7:53] know, in the middle of the night saying\n[7:55] do this workflow. Uh, and then I often\n[7:58] forget about it like but do you have a\n[8:01] better way of sort of capturing ideas\n[8:03] and stuff?\n[8:04] >> So, Chat GPT now has this feature where\n[8:07] you can create folders. So, I've been\n[8:09] working on this this well has probably\n[8:12] been there for a while, but I've been\n[8:13] using this feature to create folders\n[8:15] more more aggressively. And yeah,\n[8:18] sometimes I just tap the the dictate um\n[8:21] and I just, you know, dictate what I'm\n[8:23] thinking.\n[8:24] >> Uh for example,\n[8:25] >> that that works from the mobile, I guess\n[8:26] you must do.\n[8:28] >> Yeah. Yeah. But you can do it on on your\n[8:30] laptop as well. I started using uh\n[8:31] dictate on my my MacBook. Although that\n[8:33] the transcription is not as good as if\n[8:35] you use uh in the app because in the app\n[8:36] I think it uses the LLM to trans\n[8:38] transcribe. So um so here I was\n[8:41] literally uh in my in my bedroom and I\n[8:44] said what's data without a schema? You\n[8:46] know what's worse is data that used to\n[8:47] have a schema but the schema is gone.\n[8:49] And here I'm talking about how my idea\n[8:51] of like capturing the TypeScript um\n[8:54] schema on top of the Terraform state\n[8:56] gives you more of structured information\n[8:58] about the actual Terraform\n[9:00] infrastructure as code. Right? So, this\n[9:01] was all spoken in and transcribed by the\n[9:04] LLM and then it says like, okay, and I\n[9:06] say, hey, help me create a launch uh\n[9:08] site and it kind of captures like some\n[9:10] of the hooks that we want to put on\n[9:11] there, right? But as you can see, I have\n[9:13] a lot of like ideas and chats and it's\n[9:16] very hard for me to find back some of\n[9:17] these ideas. Um, sometimes like I know I\n[9:20] discussed something somewhere, it's\n[9:22] somewhere in in one of these chats. The\n[9:24] worst is after I've like done a drill\n[9:26] down into\n[9:26] >> So, you can't you can't search through\n[9:28] them or something like that. You can you\n[9:30] can search through this but I don't know\n[9:31] it's I I still I I have discussed the\n[9:34] same thing so many times because it\n[9:36] becomes uh you know when you do a\n[9:38] dictation you discuss something and\n[9:40] maybe you're building on something that\n[9:41] you had um discussed before uh but\n[9:44] basically it's lost somewhere in these\n[9:45] chats. So with specit\n[9:48] um I feel like I do this in a much more\n[9:52] structured way. So before speckit I had\n[9:54] these chats I had to somehow capture all\n[9:57] of these different responses from chatpt\n[9:59] pick out the bits that I liked remove\n[10:01] the bits that I didn't like and then\n[10:03] create uh a document to to to\n[10:07] basically track what I'm trying to do.\n[10:10] So with specitate that starts with like\n[10:12] a user description. So the first step is\n[10:14] to to do specify the specify command is\n[10:17] to to to kick off the workflow. So user\n[10:20] a user description is that like a use\n[10:21] case or is it something else?\n[10:24] >> Yeah, that that's that's the hardest\n[10:26] thing to to know about specit is like\n[10:28] what do I exactly say in at each uh step\n[10:31] of the way. So they do have a very good\n[10:34] example on their readme. Um there's like\n[10:37] a detailed walk through detailed process\n[10:40] where um they go through like the first\n[10:43] thing okay once you've initialized your\n[10:45] repository and it is copied over your\n[10:47] cloud commands into your git repository\n[10:49] and it set everything up for you. You\n[10:51] can choose codeex, you can choose cloud,\n[10:53] you can use github copilot because this\n[10:54] is a Microsoft product. And um they also\n[10:58] changed like now now they have a prefix\n[10:59] onto each slash command. Um I I have not\n[11:03] talked about the constitution.\n[11:04] >> Sorry Vincent you is this a Microsoft\n[11:06] product? Did you say\n[11:07] >> it's a GitHub right? GitHub is from\n[11:09] Microsoft.\n[11:10] >> Oh okay. Okay.\n[11:12] >> Yes. So so so the first thing is in this\n[11:15] example here like you need to do a\n[11:16] functional specification not the the\n[11:18] clarification you need to start on the\n[11:21] actual spec project specification right.\n[11:23] So that's the first thing you do you do\n[11:25] specify um and that's after you've done\n[11:28] constitution. So I will talk more about\n[11:30] constitution later but first you have to\n[11:32] come up with like a prompt of what we're\n[11:34] going to develop. You ask me what is\n[11:36] this thing that you're putting in. Uh be\n[11:38] as explicit as possible about what\n[11:40] you're trying to build and why. Don't\n[11:42] talk about tech. Don't say like I want\n[11:44] the Golang uh monolithic application or\n[11:46] whatever. No, you're talking purely\n[11:48] about what you're going to develop at\n[11:50] that point. And so the great thing is\n[11:52] once you've kicked off this this initial\n[11:55] prompt um it's going to come up with a\n[11:57] bunch of like what's the user scenario\n[11:59] what are the usea like what are the\n[12:01] personas um if when like user stories it\n[12:05] basically follows a template um to\n[12:09] >> so it creates the use cases for you what\n[12:12] really\n[12:12] >> yeah so the specify argument basically\n[12:14] runs a script to create new feature\n[12:17] which will then set up a new get branch.\n[12:19] So when you use spec specify to to\n[12:22] initialize your repo or your project\n[12:24] folder, it will create a git repo and\n[12:26] then you set up the constitution which I\n[12:27] will talk about later and then you say I\n[12:29] want to create a new feature. It sets up\n[12:31] a new branch for that feature and\n[12:32] prepares a spec folder. So everything is\n[12:34] organized. It's like um ADR on on\n[12:37] steroids or LLM driven ADR. Are you\n[12:39] familiar with ADR?\n[12:41] >> Uh yeah. Yeah. We I use them my work uh\n[12:44] architecture\n[12:46] uh decision record, right?\n[12:47] >> Yes. uh it's architecture decision\n[12:49] records the same thing you run a command\n[12:51] and you create a decision record\n[12:53] markdown and then you walk through it\n[12:54] with your colleagues and then you lock\n[12:55] it in right\n[12:56] >> it's the same thing here um you're doing\n[12:58] ADR but it's all driven through LLMs so\n[13:01] the LLM is asked to run a script\n[13:02] >> but this is but the uh vocabulary here\n[13:05] is a feature right you call ADR is a\n[13:07] feature here\n[13:09] >> I guess so I I I I've only read about\n[13:11] ADR I've always wanted to use it uh and\n[13:14] then I started using speckit and I was\n[13:16] like oh that's probably what ADR\n[13:18] Well, I see ADR maybe I'm doing it\n[13:20] wrong, but I see it more of a as a post\n[13:25] activity like a like a documentation\n[13:27] thing like you've worked some options uh\n[13:30] and this is why you went with this\n[13:32] option you know.\n[13:34] >> Yeah. But when I tried to contribute to\n[13:37] Atlantis, they uh they just adopted ADR\n[13:40] and they asked me to before I started\n[13:42] anything create the actual you know\n[13:45] proposal of what I'm going to build like\n[13:47] the feature what I'm going to build and\n[13:48] and how I'm going to build it and where\n[13:50] I'm going to make changes so that they\n[13:51] could agree uh with me first if this was\n[13:54] the way that they they wanted the\n[13:55] project to evolve uh for my feature to\n[13:58] get a better chance to get it uh\n[13:59] accepted. Right. And I I think in open\n[14:01] source that's kind of how you use ADR.\n[14:03] Well, I always think the other way\n[14:05] around like I I think you need to have\n[14:06] code otherwise you don't have an ADR\n[14:09] really. You need to have an\n[14:10] implementation. You need to because\n[14:12] because you know you can you can propose\n[14:14] the moon on a stick but does it even\n[14:16] work? You'll never know.\n[14:20] >> I think you don't Yeah, sure. You you\n[14:23] must have some type of credibility in in\n[14:25] the changes that you're proposing. But\n[14:27] for example, for me, I spend maybe a day\n[14:29] or two reading the Atlantis source code\n[14:31] and then identifying a couple of areas\n[14:33] where I think the feature should impact\n[14:36] and and then I can put my ADR in before\n[14:38] I write the code to get like a a sanity\n[14:41] check from the project maintainers,\n[14:42] right? Like I'm saying I'm going to\n[14:44] build this feature and I believe I need\n[14:45] to change these code paths and they may\n[14:47] very quickly flag well actually that\n[14:50] code path kind of deprecated. um more of\n[14:52] the of the logic that you're looking at\n[14:54] lives there and and we can get that\n[14:56] right first. Right.\n[14:57] >> Okay. I I guess I guess to be honest\n[14:59] it's it is a better attack cuz early\n[15:01] early fast feedback is is a principle\n[15:04] uh I also live by but uh if this project\n[15:08] does it then then go for it I suppose.\n[15:11] >> Yeah. So in my case with the Atlantic\n[15:12] situation I was like great I get to\n[15:14] create my first ADR. I'll do it next\n[15:17] week. And then next week never happened.\n[15:19] So um anyway with specit I I was very\n[15:24] motivated with due to the recent events\n[15:26] to to like really try out um how this\n[15:29] could like work and without specit this\n[15:33] is what I came up with like I come with\n[15:34] the product requirement definition. I\n[15:36] created like a V1 of what I want. I want\n[15:39] the API to look like this and then a V2\n[15:41] a little bit updated after more chat GPT\n[15:43] chats and then I asked uh cloud go ahead\n[15:46] and and did it and and cloud was very\n[15:47] enthusiastic. Um it always goes like\n[15:50] perfect amazing the test pass\n[15:52] everything's great but nothing worked\n[15:54] like nothing worked together.\n[15:56] >> Okay. So this is your this was your\n[15:57] first way. Okay. Okay.\n[15:59] >> Yeah. Yeah. This was my first way. So I\n[16:00] went into chat uh did a bunch of chats\n[16:03] tried to uh you know consolidate it into\n[16:06] like a a product requirement document\n[16:09] tried to capture all of the things that\n[16:10] I wanted repository layout\n[16:12] >> because I because I guess you went tech\n[16:14] first here and maybe specitate is the\n[16:16] other way. I I have so this is the the\n[16:18] big thing I learned about speckit is\n[16:20] like I I never really did proper product\n[16:23] um development and I didn't have all of\n[16:26] these users scenarios and all and edge\n[16:28] cases thought out I this way like I can\n[16:31] do it for very small things like I want\n[16:32] to build a terapform provider I want to\n[16:34] build a small binary I want to build a\n[16:35] terminal user interface I can even\n[16:38] terminal user interface start to get a\n[16:39] little bit dodgy but like because cloud\n[16:41] is so good at like being being creative\n[16:44] it kind of works like oh great cloud\n[16:46] came up with all this additional stuff\n[16:47] that I never asked for, but because the\n[16:49] project was small enough, it actually\n[16:50] worked. It was able to complete it, for\n[16:52] example. But once you start hitting like\n[16:54] a big project where you have many moving\n[16:56] parts that need to lift to like work\n[16:57] together and and then you have\n[16:58] assumptions on the left and assumptions\n[17:00] on the right and nothing works together,\n[17:03] >> right?\n[17:04] >> So, so that's where specit is really\n[17:06] great. Um because and I there was a\n[17:08] thread earlier on on Reddit about that I\n[17:11] just read earlier on Reddit um which was\n[17:14] a way to capture the like in a monor\n[17:17] repo to capture the meaning of each\n[17:19] directory because when you want to make\n[17:20] changes in a monor repo there's\n[17:23] definitely responsibilities that live in\n[17:25] certain parts and if you unleash an an\n[17:28] LLM it will just like try to do\n[17:29] everything in one area and then\n[17:31] >> you know duplicate the logic. So this is\n[17:33] I I mean I I like the owners uh\n[17:36] paradigm. I mean to be honest I don't\n[17:38] work on projects with that many owners\n[17:41] to be honest. Uh but the the a the I\n[17:44] like the um the agent markdown is is\n[17:46] quite cool because you can sprinkle them\n[17:48] in in your in your code hierarchy. Um\n[17:51] >> okay. Yeah. So you could you could\n[17:53] capture a bit more like don't do this\n[17:54] here. If you need to change let's go\n[17:56] over there.\n[17:57] >> I suppose\n[17:57] >> but it's tedious to maintain it right.\n[18:00] So, so what is the approach here for for\n[18:02] like\n[18:03] >> okay so so so the Reddit thread was\n[18:05] mentioning we they they iterate on an\n[18:08] idea and then after 20 messages back and\n[18:10] forth the context kind of grows and then\n[18:13] over time the LLM when it actually\n[18:14] starts implementing it to totally loses\n[18:16] track of where things are supposed to go\n[18:18] like you said you can like manually\n[18:20] maintain agent files across your\n[18:21] repository the way that specit\n[18:23] approaches this is when you get down to\n[18:26] the actual task generation it's very\n[18:29] specific specific about where you're\n[18:30] going to change what and why. So every\n[18:32] single task that the LLM works on has\n[18:35] very detailed like all self-contained\n[18:37] information. Like\n[18:39] that's at the very end and and I'm\n[18:41] telling you specit takes me like easily\n[18:44] two five hour sessions. So easily like\n[18:47] two hours per session. So 4 hours at\n[18:49] least to get it to the point before I\n[18:51] even start to write code which is very\n[18:53] frustrating when you start because\n[18:54] you're so used to you know jump into\n[18:56] cloud and have it generate a whole bunch\n[18:57] of code and now you have to like go\n[18:59] through all of these edge cases you know\n[19:02] review the functional requirements you\n[19:04] know do research and then align the plan\n[19:06] and the research against those\n[19:07] functional requirements and validate it\n[19:09] and and and the first time my first\n[19:12] feature which is like the start like\n[19:14] bootstrap the mon repo and build some\n[19:16] basic functionality\n[19:18] it I totally like yes yes yes yes okay\n[19:21] yes next on the first few steps because\n[19:23] I also didn't even know what like most\n[19:25] of those steps were meant to do um and\n[19:27] and so I I ran up the the implementation\n[19:30] part became very painful because specit\n[19:33] divides it and you you specify the\n[19:34] feature you you know start to formulate\n[19:37] a plan where you actually define what is\n[19:39] the text stack that you want to use that\n[19:41] gets you know does some research to find\n[19:43] out more about the libraries that you're\n[19:44] interacting with and how they integrate\n[19:46] with each\n[19:47] Um and then once you've got the\n[19:49] research, the plan, some data, models,\n[19:52] then you start to generate the tasks and\n[19:54] then you go through a couple of\n[19:56] iterations of actually analyzing very\n[19:58] very carefully how those functional\n[20:00] requirements map back to those tasks and\n[20:02] if everything is like covered in terms\n[20:04] of like um requirements and and and\n[20:08] >> and I did like like I said the first\n[20:09] time I completely ignored that iteration\n[20:12] and I went straight into implementation\n[20:14] and halfway through I realized I made a\n[20:15] big mistake. and like half of the code\n[20:17] was actually not not quite right and I\n[20:20] had to go back and try to make changes\n[20:22] and I found it a bit hard to like uh\n[20:25] adjust the course at that point because\n[20:27] I hadn't done the a lot of the research\n[20:29] up front and of course\n[20:31] >> the idea is like how can I know that\n[20:33] I've got everything right from the start\n[20:35] right um you can't but\n[20:38] >> um with this approach now with like\n[20:40] really going into a lot of the edge\n[20:42] cases the the feature that I did last\n[20:44] time which was like adding\n[20:46] um labels on terraform states literally\n[20:49] I think two days to get the specs right\n[20:52] and then I went to sleep at like 9:00\n[20:54] p.m. Ask cloud to start implementing\n[20:56] maybe woke up around like midnight to\n[20:59] ask codeex to review and continue the\n[21:00] implementation and then by morning 7:00\n[21:03] a.m. kicked off another final\n[21:05] implementation round and by lunch it was\n[21:07] fully implemented and it hadn't\n[21:09] encountered any issues and I went\n[21:11] straight into the UI and it worked and\n[21:13] it was like holy crazy.\n[21:16] >> So this is really interesting. So\n[21:19] >> what you said there where you got clawed\n[21:22] to kick off the implementation.\n[21:24] Um is is that like a specit thing to\n[21:27] like you know specit implement? Okay.\n[21:30] >> Yes.\n[21:31] And then is it also a spec kit thing to\n[21:33] like get codeex another model to review\n[21:36] it?\n[21:37] >> Uh not not explicitly but they do say\n[21:40] that it's an interactive process. So\n[21:43] they give you these starter commands to\n[21:44] create those documents and you're they\n[21:47] also say like don't expect this like\n[21:50] >> um don't expect the first response to be\n[21:52] what you want right you must actually\n[21:53] validate and go through it. Um and then\n[21:56] you know the first thing is after it\n[21:57] went through this prompt it will then\n[22:00] have a couple of needs clarification. It\n[22:01] will generate edge cases like you may\n[22:04] say here they talk about task taskify a\n[22:06] team productivity platform should allow\n[22:08] users to create projects and then it\n[22:10] will create like um clarification\n[22:12] questions like what if two users create\n[22:14] this project with the same name like\n[22:16] what what happens because you haven't\n[22:18] clarified that right what if the user\n[22:21] deletes a project that is um has a lot\n[22:24] of tasks assigned to it how like is\n[22:26] there a delete cascade in the background\n[22:28] like how does that work so you have to\n[22:30] go through a lot of these um details.\n[22:32] >> Well, okay. So, this this sounds great.\n[22:35] Absolutely great for like bootstrapping\n[22:36] a project. But what what happens if you\n[22:38] the uh just out of interest if there was\n[22:40] an existing project like say you have an\n[22:43] existing project and you want to\n[22:46] specitify it? Is that possible?\n[22:49] >> They do have a section about introducing\n[22:51] it on existing projects. I have to say\n[22:53] like this YouTube video here on the on\n[22:55] the on the root p on the landing page or\n[22:57] the root rate me it takes you to the\n[22:59] channel of of one of the main advocates\n[23:01] behind it and if you look at his posts\n[23:03] from the like his YouTube videos from\n[23:05] the like week last week and literally I\n[23:07] think 3 days ago he did another update\n[23:09] because they changed a couple of the\n[23:10] commands they added new command into it\n[23:12] which is a checklist command for your um\n[23:15] validation so you can validate that you\n[23:18] have really covered every area. Um, so,\n[23:20] so these YouTube videos are amazing and\n[23:22] he does talk about like how to go and\n[23:25] use it into an existing project. Yeah, I\n[23:27] think this is when I talk to people that\n[23:29] use Ko, they say that this is very\n[23:32] similar to Ko um but it's completely\n[23:35] independent from like a specific IDE,\n[23:37] right? You it works with multiple uh LLM\n[23:40] agents. It uses the CLI under the hood.\n[23:43] So, cloud is actually calling the cloud\n[23:45] CLI to do some like summarizations and\n[23:47] things like that under the hood. So when\n[23:49] you mentioned Kira that that's uh sorry\n[23:51] I I I not too sure what that means.\n[23:55] >> Kirro is an AWS product that kind of\n[23:58] launched the idea of specdriven\n[24:00] development right they they really said\n[24:03] like people are using Almstrong uh the\n[24:06] specification is where you should start\n[24:08] and they build a whole IDE around it.\n[24:11] Ah, so Speckit and Kirro, how are they\n[24:15] related? Just\n[24:17] >> not at all.\n[24:18] >> They're not related. Okay.\n[24:19] >> Yeah. So, so, so Kira is a commercial\n[24:21] product from AWS. It's an ID with a\n[24:23] subscription with a subscription and\n[24:26] they use Sonale as well. Um, but they\n[24:30] provide you they have like nice little\n[24:33] hooks inside the IDE. For example, if\n[24:35] you have a task, there's a little green\n[24:37] button that appears around it. So, you\n[24:38] can click start implementing this task.\n[24:40] and the LLM and start implementing it.\n[24:42] That's kind of like you see that that's\n[24:43] on the demo right now.\n[24:45] >> Yeah. It's kind of like pretty cool.\n[24:46] Yeah.\n[24:47] >> Yeah. Because I mean Copilot has that,\n[24:49] you know, you can like save and\n[24:52] >> Yeah. Or\n[24:52] >> I I think I think the specit with GitHub\n[24:56] copilot does a similar thing, but I'm\n[24:58] not using GitHub copilot. I'm just using\n[24:59] the cloud code with because I'm used to\n[25:01] cloud code. Yeah.\n[25:03] >> Cool. Man, this is this is mind-blowing\n[25:05] stuff, man. So, okay. So you got your\n[25:07] speck kit, you got your task breakdown,\n[25:09] you you kick it off overnight, you get\n[25:11] codeex to review it. So how do you kick\n[25:14] off codeex by the way? Is it is it just\n[25:16] a like what you\n[25:18] >> originally I always use the codeex ID on\n[25:21] the side here? So I just install the the\n[25:23] the plugin into in here. I need to\n[25:25] update it I guess. Um so on one side I\n[25:28] have copilot the GitHub you know\n[25:30] provided. I have a seat uh provided by\n[25:33] organization as well and then I have my\n[25:35] personal codeex here. um that I have\n[25:38] that I that is\n[25:40] yeah that that's my codeex.\n[25:42] >> Okay.\n[25:43] >> I don't know what to say about it.\n[25:45] >> So so your codeex is specified like how\n[25:48] do you know that it's like\n[25:51] >> yeah so so codeex only supported prompt\n[25:55] arguments since last week. So the the\n[25:58] speckit has this argument at the start\n[26:00] here right the user input the user will\n[26:03] provide some input. So when you kick off\n[26:04] the command here um\n[26:08] when you kick off specify yeah this is\n[26:11] classic cloud code doing the disco in\n[26:13] the terminal um so when you say like\n[26:16] we're we're we are going to revise the\n[26:22] filtering\n[26:23] library or something like that right I\n[26:26] don't know that's actually not a good\n[26:27] spec because it should not be related to\n[26:28] the there's no functional requirement\n[26:30] there's no that's just pure tech that's\n[26:32] a really that spec actually. Okay, it\n[26:35] should really be about like the user\n[26:36] filtering experience is bad. Uh the\n[26:38] perform like when a user clicks the\n[26:41] filter it takes you know minutes before\n[26:43] the result appears and then it will\n[26:46] generate user stories and edge cases and\n[26:48] like what are the benchmarks that we\n[26:50] need to create what are the tests to\n[26:51] validate that that it is implemented\n[26:53] correctly and then we can go into the\n[26:55] technical research like okay we find\n[26:57] some hot pots we need to add some\n[26:58] indexes into the database and do things\n[27:00] like that. So that would be in the in\n[27:02] the plan phase. So specify the first\n[27:04] phase you say the functional requirement\n[27:06] why do you need to do this what you want\n[27:07] to do exactly. Then you do plan where it\n[27:10] will kick off um several documents and\n[27:12] and no actually before sorry before you\n[27:15] go into plan um the specify will have\n[27:18] generated edge cases and will have\n[27:20] questions like what happens if uh if\n[27:23] this or that right and then it will ask\n[27:25] you clarification about how do you want\n[27:27] to handle those like are you okay with\n[27:29] this um and when you click up and for\n[27:32] that also there's there's um an LLM\n[27:34] prompt which will basically go through\n[27:37] the document find any areas that needs\n[27:39] clarification and then give you three or\n[27:41] four options on how you may want to\n[27:43] address this. So there's a question\n[27:45] option A, B or C. So because we all use\n[27:47] NLM ultimately to answer those\n[27:49] questions, right? Yeah, I don't really\n[27:50] I'm not really sure like what are some\n[27:52] of the common ways that I could solve\n[27:53] this and suspect it will give you like\n[27:55] three or four uh clarification options\n[27:57] there and then you can\n[27:58] >> so but going back to codec soc.\n[28:02] So you basically run some commands in\n[28:04] claude and you run uh the same sort of\n[28:07] commands in in codeex alternately.\n[28:11] >> Yeah. So codec since last week has these\n[28:14] arguments. So I I I started using the\n[28:17] CLI and what I noticed is that the CLI\n[28:20] in CEX never wants to execute the\n[28:22] scripts. Maybe this is some training\n[28:24] that OpenAI did to prevent like uh\n[28:26] prompt injection attacks because there's\n[28:28] been a few. So, so Codex even if the\n[28:31] prompt says you will run this script, it\n[28:33] doesn't run the script. So, so now I'm\n[28:35] like confirm to me you will run this\n[28:36] particular script and that works and it\n[28:38] says yes I will run it and then actually\n[28:41] when I say\n[28:42] >> um I I I trigger the prompt. So you see\n[28:44] the prompt was expanded here. So I call\n[28:46] the prompt command and then it says user\n[28:49] input is here. We need to identify\n[28:51] actually I left the user input blank it\n[28:52] looks like. Um I also noticed that if I\n[28:55] put too much codeex will just lose half\n[28:57] the prompt. I don't know. So maybe I\n[28:59] stopped putting\n[29:00] >> prompts. So on the subject of security,\n[29:02] I'm not going to lie, when I use Claude,\n[29:05] I sometimes specify, you know, skip\n[29:08] dangerously skip permissions because I\n[29:11] hate having to uh, you know, press\n[29:14] enter.\n[29:15] >> Yeah.\n[29:15] >> So do you have a different approach to\n[29:18] to security?\n[29:21] >> Uh, depends on what repository I work\n[29:24] on. If it's my own that I just\n[29:26] bootstrapped, I'm okay with like most of\n[29:27] it. Yeah.\n[29:28] >> So you just skip all the permissions.\n[29:30] >> I don't run MCPS or barely any because I\n[29:33] believe that MCPS pollute the uh context\n[29:36] window and the context window is scarce.\n[29:38] So I try to keep as much of the context\n[29:40] window free and so I only one MCP. Now\n[29:45] >> on on the on the subject of context\n[29:47] window like um I do think the\n[29:50] interaction with MCP is quite good\n[29:51] because it tells you when it runs the\n[29:53] tool. It tells you what the input is and\n[29:55] the output. Um, at least with Claude,\n[29:57] it's quite clear to me, but like to me\n[30:00] to me like a lot of these prompt\n[30:02] prompting things,\n[30:04] uh, I mean, they're quite verbose. I\n[30:06] mean, like when you when you're running\n[30:08] these commands, are you actually viewing\n[30:10] all the input? Are you like like do you\n[30:13] have a a finger on the whole context\n[30:15] window or do you letting it do its\n[30:17] thing?\n[30:20] >> It depends. Like I used to be very\n[30:23] hands-on with the implementation phase.\n[30:25] Definitely when I wasn't going very\n[30:27] detailed with like all the educations\n[30:28] and functional requirements I started I\n[30:31] realized I need to stop it to do the\n[30:32] wrong thing. However like the last\n[30:34] feature that I let it implement like\n[30:36] literally I went to sleep. So I after I\n[30:39] feel a lot more confident about the I\n[30:42] ran the validate process like four times\n[30:45] literally I think I use 50 I think at\n[30:48] this point I use almost like 40% of my\n[30:50] weekly token budget just on spec\n[30:53] generation and and and like validation\n[30:55] of the specs and then the actual\n[30:57] implementation takes 30% or so. Yeah.\n[31:00] >> Wow. So, and then your spec um what is\n[31:03] the source of truth there? Like it's is\n[31:06] it sitting in in a markdown file\n[31:08] somewhere?\n[31:08] >> Yeah. So, that's a that's a pattern I\n[31:10] did before specit as well because cloud\n[31:13] is great when you first start start\n[31:15] using cloud. You go like let's go in\n[31:16] plan mode and create a bunch of to-dos\n[31:18] and then it ticks nicely through those\n[31:20] to-dos. If you get stuck on something,\n[31:21] you can like re like help it, you can\n[31:23] nudge it along. You're following along\n[31:24] and all that, right? But very quickly\n[31:26] when the projects gets bigger, you you\n[31:28] ident you realize that those to-dos like\n[31:30] they're sometimes based on\n[31:32] misconceptions or or you run out of\n[31:34] context and then you need to compact and\n[31:36] then the compact summary throws away a\n[31:38] lot of the stuff that you originally was\n[31:39] part of the reasons why the to-dos\n[31:41] existed. So so those to-dos don't scale\n[31:44] and so I started say asking cloud like\n[31:47] okay check off the things that you've\n[31:48] completed like when it started\n[31:50] approaching context window limits and\n[31:52] write it down for handover. I call it\n[31:53] like we need to hand over to someone,\n[31:55] right? So, write everything down into a\n[31:56] markdown. Um, and then I would open a a\n[31:59] new cloud session. Well, I didn't know\n[32:00] how to use the clear comp um command\n[32:03] properly, but I used a new cloud window\n[32:05] and then I would just like read the\n[32:06] handover document. Um, there's a couple\n[32:08] of to-dos there.\n[32:10] >> There's there's a command called\n[32:11] compact, right? I think you\n[32:12] >> Yes, but I found that the compact throws\n[32:16] away like too many details. definitely\n[32:18] some of the initial research that you've\n[32:20] done and some of the reasoning why the\n[32:21] to-dos exists and then if you you know\n[32:24] halfway through are going down the wrong\n[32:26] path and then the original you know\n[32:28] logic is gone then the to-dos no longer\n[32:31] makes sense and then cloud starts to be\n[32:32] very creative and then it nothing works\n[32:35] anymore. So that's why I already had\n[32:37] this this experience um of of throwing\n[32:40] away contexts easily and that's\n[32:43] something that people say like\n[32:45] >> you know your context is like a jewel\n[32:47] you need to craft it very right to get\n[32:49] it into the right you know data that you\n[32:51] want and actually cloud added a lot of\n[32:53] commands for you like the double escape\n[32:55] if you are uh on cloud you can double\n[32:57] double escape and you can rewind back to\n[33:01] one of the previous like context\n[33:02] snapshots or something like that\n[33:04] >> I didn't know that\n[33:05] >> res and you can even this one actually\n[33:07] double escape is restore the code or\n[33:09] conversation from a point before. This\n[33:10] is something\n[33:11] >> escape. Wow, I knew about I just learned\n[33:13] about shift tab I think. I think is it\n[33:15] shift tab?\n[33:15] >> Yeah, shift tab. Shift tab is like the\n[33:17] the amazing experience when you first\n[33:19] start using cloud code like because you\n[33:21] actually get to you know determine the\n[33:23] plan and the to-dos before you start\n[33:25] writing down anything, right? But again\n[33:27] like the plan mode hits it limit when\n[33:29] you start building right large\n[33:30] repositories. And so that's where, you\n[33:34] know, writing things down into a\n[33:35] markdown for handover really helps. And\n[33:37] then specit um really formalizes that\n[33:40] workflow because it really puts in like\n[33:42] first we're going to get the functional\n[33:44] requirements, then we're going to go\n[33:45] through it and we're going to eliminate\n[33:47] anything that needs clarification. It's\n[33:48] literally one of the checkboxes. If you\n[33:50] try to run the plan command or the plan\n[33:52] prompt, normally cloud will see the\n[33:54] instruction that if there's anything\n[33:56] that still needs clarification, abort\n[33:58] straight back to the user. You need to\n[33:59] go clarify. Wow. Yeah,\n[34:01] >> but the funny thing is it's LLMs, right?\n[34:03] So, so when I do this with codecs,\n[34:06] sometimes it sees this and just goes\n[34:07] like, \"Yeah, whatever.\" And just keeps\n[34:08] going. It's like, \"Come on, man. There's\n[34:10] It's right there. Don't continue if\n[34:12] there's still items to be clarified.\"\n[34:14] >> Sorry if I asked you this question\n[34:15] before, but how did you come across Spec\n[34:17] Kit?\n[34:18] >> Um, how did I come across it?\n[34:21] >> Like hacker news or something?\n[34:22] >> No, I'm I'm I'm on like a lot of\n[34:25] Reddits. I'm on cloud code Reddit, on\n[34:27] entropic, on the OpenAI Reddit, like the\n[34:30] subreddits, I mean, and I think it was\n[34:33] posted there. I definitely saw all of\n[34:35] the like on the AWS subreddit about Ko.\n[34:37] I read a lot about specri development. I\n[34:40] didn't I was building something at the\n[34:42] time with cloud code and I was quite\n[34:43] happy the way it was going. But it\n[34:45] definitely resonated with me because I\n[34:46] was doing already those handover\n[34:47] documents basically define what needs to\n[34:50] be developed. I just didn't realize how\n[34:53] how detailed the process was. Um\n[34:56] >> because yeah so so what what you asked\n[34:58] me earlier is like how does this\n[35:00] actually work on an existing project and\n[35:01] when you need to like adopt things I I\n[35:05] don't know\n[35:06] >> okay\n[35:07] >> because I I started from scratch but I\n[35:09] am using it on a large project right now\n[35:11] and it is able to add in new features\n[35:13] quite\n[35:14] >> I think we're bouncing around a bit like\n[35:16] I I still don't actually understand\n[35:17] where your your specs live. They just\n[35:19] live in the specs folder there.\n[35:21] >> Okay. So, so the first step is you\n[35:23] specify what you're trying to build, why\n[35:25] you're trying to build it, and then it\n[35:27] will when you kick off that pro prompt,\n[35:29] it will create a branch and it will\n[35:31] create a folder in the specs directory.\n[35:33] And so then you're working on a branch\n[35:35] on that specific feature, right? So this\n[35:37] is one of the things people mention on\n[35:39] Reddit is like how does this scale\n[35:40] across a team like how do you keep track\n[35:42] of like multiple people and their spec\n[35:44] branches? So I also don't know that like\n[35:46] this is a question that my colleague\n[35:47] asked me when I I showed it to him. um\n[35:50] like how will this like do you have\n[35:52] everyone working on their own spec\n[35:54] branches and so on? How do you\n[35:56] collaborate on these branches?\n[35:57] >> Um because it's going to be\n[35:58] >> I can't answer those questions.\n[35:59] >> If it's a fastmoving project, it might\n[36:01] be a real pain to to merge, right?\n[36:05] >> There might be a lot of different uh so\n[36:07] so I think that's one important thing.\n[36:09] Aside from the agents, there's the\n[36:12] constellation uh which is part of the\n[36:14] memory. So it creates a dot. So on one\n[36:16] side it creates your commands under your\n[36:18] cloud or your agent. So it has the\n[36:20] prepared prompts there. Then it creates\n[36:22] a special specify folder where it has\n[36:24] the templates. For example, when it\n[36:26] needs to write a new spec, it it has a\n[36:29] very detailed plan template. So again,\n[36:30] this is kind of like one shot or nshot\n[36:34] LLM usage where you tell it like look at\n[36:36] this and now replicate it. Now look at\n[36:38] this then followed my example. Follow my\n[36:40] example. Right? So it say read this then\n[36:42] do this. Read this then do this. Right?\n[36:44] So it it follows cloud is great. It\n[36:46] follows this structure really really\n[36:47] well. Codeex sometimes gives you a\n[36:49] completely different template like\n[36:52] completely nothing like it and sometimes\n[36:54] chip 5 just\n[36:56] >> what do you mean\n[36:56] >> very nicely follows it.\n[36:57] >> It like it doesn't read\n[36:59] >> it doesn't follow it. I don't know why\n[37:01] Sona is doing a great job but uh that's\n[37:03] why that's why I have very dedicated\n[37:05] like if I want\n[37:06] >> so so what is doing a good job? Sonai\n[37:09] >> sonet son um is a French way to say\n[37:11] sonet uh\n[37:14] >> sonet means a tune or doesn't it or like\n[37:17] a\n[37:18] >> it's a it's a type of pros I think like\n[37:22] if you write\n[37:23] >> son\n[37:25] >> okay yeah\n[37:26] >> so I'm going to I'm going to be I'm\n[37:27] going to say this is a French word\n[37:29] originally right\n[37:30] >> yeah just like\n[37:31] >> proson\n[37:32] >> uh\n[37:34] so you're using four you're using 4.5 I\n[37:36] mean when it comes to model choices is\n[37:38] are you quite are you picky about it? Do\n[37:40] you go son for the 4.5?\n[37:42] So this is the thing right these things\n[37:44] change so fast um that's why I also\n[37:47] avoid MCPS and other stuff like I trust\n[37:50] them to provide the best working\n[37:52] environment I cannot keep up with it so\n[37:55] when they say use Sony 4.5 I'll be okay\n[37:59] and they and uh and and that's the thing\n[38:01] where a lot of people last week were\n[38:03] very upset and because they are kind of\n[38:05] telling people not to use opus and they\n[38:07] make you blow your budget if you use\n[38:09] opus they charge it double right they\n[38:11] really want people to use Sonet and\n[38:13] people are like oh Son is not as good as\n[38:14] Opus blah blah blah but\n[38:16] >> they really craft code and the context\n[38:19] and the tooling everything around the\n[38:21] model and they're saying really don't\n[38:22] use don't use sorry don't use opus so\n[38:25] >> that's good to hear because like I had\n[38:27] like some FOMO that I'm just not using\n[38:30] making\n[38:31] >> the right choices but I it has it has to\n[38:33] be auto going forward I mean it's\n[38:35] >> I agree like it's it's a full-time job\n[38:38] like I watch some YouTube channels like\n[38:40] go coder who very frequently breaks down\n[38:43] he has his own benchmark um where he\n[38:45] says okay I've tested Quen I've tested\n[38:48] GLM I've tested JGPT OSS uh for local\n[38:52] LLMs um and and he goes into great\n[38:55] detail and I used to like wait until\n[38:58] made a video to actually figure out is\n[38:59] there like an improvement is there a\n[39:01] significant improvement in his benchmark\n[39:03] that would justify me to spend time to\n[39:05] play with it and and I've actually\n[39:06] started um I mean at some point you just\n[39:10] want to get the worked on. You don't\n[39:12] have the time to just keep reading about\n[39:14] all the LLMs and\n[39:15] >> cuz cuz every time there's like, oh,\n[39:17] actually you need to use XML now. Yeah,\n[39:19] you you should pro you write your prom.\n[39:20] Oh, actually YAML is much better. Oh,\n[39:22] no, no, JSON is the way.\n[39:24] >> I'm sure you're making some crazy\n[39:25] examples there. Anyway, I I think\n[39:27] >> No, no, that's real. That's real like\n[39:29] Reddit posts about this is my JSON\n[39:32] >> formatted. Yes. No, it's not a\n[39:34] >> that's like that's like a virus. Like\n[39:36] you start using XML and then uh\n[39:38] headache. Yeah.\n[39:39] >> Um\n[39:41] Oh, I think you g I think you gave me at\n[39:43] least a very good overview of uh spec\n[39:45] kit there. So maybe maybe we should we\n[39:48] should go back to to uh the value add on\n[39:51] Terraform.",

Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 54,657 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line.

I I know you've been itching.\nStraight on to the demo. Yeah, I can. Um\ngive me a minute. I'll cut this out.\n>> Are you on Are you on Mac? cuz the\n>> Yeah, I am.\n>> Okay.\n>> It's It follows me. It\n>> You got center stage enabled.\n>> Yeah. I have no idea. It just works,\nright?\n>> Sorry, I have to uh plug some I have a\npump. My AC pump. My AC is um in a funny\nposition and it needs to pump the water\nout up. So, there's a pump, but the pump\nis a bit dodgy.\n>> What's your temperature there? It looks\nlike you're sweaty. And\n>> yeah, I went to the gym this morning. So\nit is it is quite hot here.\n>> Yeah. Uh but I did so that's another\nthat's a great thing about AI but and\nthose budgets of AI by the way because I\nhit my budget like I have a 5 hour\nsession and then I hit my budget maybe\nin two hours and so then I have 3 hours\nto go to the gym, right? I mean the\namount of work I get done in two hours\nis is pretty much the same what I what I\nwould do in a day. So it's pretty great.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, I I never thought about like\nthat, but yeah, like I'm a big fan of\nlike uh being careful with your time and\nyou know the Pomodoro technique where\nyou just jam in stuff. So if is\n>> So is the AI spend limit or Claude\nworking the same way? Which plan are you\non again?\n>> I'm on the like the lowest paid plan 20\nbucks around Codex and Cloud.\n>> Sorry. Oh, and it and it basically works\nby by time. Like if you smashing your\nyour token,\n>> the moment you send your first message,\na 5 hour session starts\n>> and then you get a certain token budget\nwithin those 5 hours depending on your\nplan. And so it will remind you now they\nadded like a nice usage command since\nthey did sonet 4.5 last week and cloud\ncode version two. So they added a lot\nmore um context management and\nnotifications about your usage um when\nand and also they added more I think\nthey enforcing the weekly limits\nstronger and um basically\nwithin 5 hours you have a budget you\nkeep track of how it's going so I can\nsee like oh I'm at 50% let me maybe do a\nlittle bit more myself instead of just\nasking cloud to do it or or like um\nswitch over to Codeex which often do.\nUm, so that\n>> I I tried Codeex I think after you\ntalking about it and it is a lot better\nexperience than I remember.\n>> Yeah, it has improved a lot but I don't\nuse the CLI. Uh although that the CLI\nnow recently has been updated as well.\nIt's a little bit better. But the the\nIDE plugin, you know, lets you paste in\nimages, reference well, you can\nreference files on both sides. But I\nfind the I the IDE um plugin quite nice\nin uh in codeex because I can, you know,\nput it on full agent mode and it seems\nto use its tools and utility like better\nlike when it needs to edit a file.\n>> Maybe you should show share the screen.\nshow show it perhaps\n>> I think cuz that would be more\ninteresting for people. Okay,\nso this is a project that I've been\nworking on since the last time we talked\nwhere we talked about some of the events\nhappening around Terraform states and\nstate management open tacos announcement\nand I've talked to those people and I\nwanted to get some features in but I\nhave not been able to reach them and so\nI started decided like it can't be that\nhard right I even commented on one guy\nlike he posted like oh when you start a\nnew project it's so exciting because you\nget to make a text tech decisions and\nthen maybe you will regret those and I\nsaid like well cloud will oneshot it\nanyway so who cares\nso I I I thought if I I talk big like\nthat let me try it right let me see if I\ncan oneot this thing\n>> I'm I'm curious to see what's in your\nclaw directory in your codeex which is\njust session management or something\n>> so this is what spec this is speckit um\nspeckit gives you a command to bootstrap\na repository to use speckit this kind of\nfunny Now because cloud code uh has\nannounced plug-in marketplace so you can\nlook at specit like a plug-in market\nsorry like a like a marketplace plug-in\nit comes with a bunch of commands\nbasically prompt templates a bunch of\nscripts and um yeah that's pretty much\nit like it uses templates for some uh\nspecification files that you may want to\nbuild. So, so this cloud folder here\nthat has these commands, this is all\nprepared by specit.\n>> Oh, I see. So, it just So, what's a\ncommand then? It's like a it's like a\nprompt.\n>> I will try. Hold on. Um I I I want to\nopen the the specit website. Yeah. So,\num a command is like a prepared prompt.\nIt can have arguments. So you can call\nthose you know like when you do slash\nyou can um call those like analyze.\n>> Yes. So then you all of your files that\nyou put in here under the commands\nfolder will show up as slashcomands in\nyour cloud code and you can also have\narguments.\n>> Do do you use that a lot? I mean do you\nactually\n>> speckit is completely built around this\nworkflow. So I've never used it until I\nuse specit. So you basically I mean so\nyou find yourself going analyze clarify\nconstitution whatever that means in plan\n>> I don't know I've never used kro but the\nidea let me go spec kit let me open the\nwebsite of spec kit the idea of\nspecdriven development is to basically\ncapture the reasoning behind code\nbecause they say rightfully so that the\ncode itself is no long is never hold on\nI'm going to open this\nThey have a website here somewhere.\nUh anyway,\nwhere is the\nthe ideology behind it? Hold on, let me\nfind that\nspec driven development.\n>> Right. So, so the the whole idea behind\nspecket which is the code was never\nreally the secret sauce like before um\nbasically people delivered code and the\ncode is what represents the business\nlogic documentation outdates becomes\noutdated very quickly but with LLM\ndriven workflows the code becomes more\nof like an after like an artifact\nsomething that gets produced and you\nquickly like factor it or throw it away\nand what's more important is your\nspecifications and the test suites built\naround\nRight.\n>> Specs and test suites. I I fully agree\nthat sounds really good.\n>> So, so the power of inversion like this\nthis this explanation is really good to\nread up front to understand really why\nit matters and why it is really worth it\nto do it that way. Definitely if you\nworked like like my previous workflow\nbefore speckit was I spend time with\nchipt on the web interface or in my\nphone when I'm in bed or when I'm\nwalking around thinking about ideas and\ntrying to understand how to use certain\ntechnology in some of my projects\non on that note like um how do you\ncapture your ideas that you have\nspontaneously like I to be honest I I\ntry use voice recording\nand just cap try capture like me, you\nknow, in the middle of the night saying\ndo this workflow. Uh, and then I often\nforget about it like but do you have a\nbetter way of sort of capturing ideas\nand stuff?\n>> So, Chat GPT now has this feature where\nyou can create folders. So, I've been\nworking on this this well has probably\nbeen there for a while, but I've been\nusing this feature to create folders\nmore more aggressively. And yeah,\nsometimes I just tap the the dictate um\nand I just, you know, dictate what I'm\nthinking.\n>> Uh for example,\n>> that that works from the mobile, I guess\nyou must do.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But you can do it on on your\nlaptop as well. I started using uh\ndictate on my my MacBook. Although that\nthe transcription is not as good as if\nyou use uh in the app because in the app\nI think it uses the LLM to trans\ntranscribe. So um so here I was\nliterally uh in my in my bedroom and I\nsaid what's data without a schema? You\nknow what's worse is data that used to\nhave a schema but the schema is gone.\nAnd here I'm talking about how my idea\nof like capturing the TypeScript um\nschema on top of the Terraform state\ngives you more of structured information\nabout the actual Terraform\ninfrastructure as code. Right? So, this\nwas all spoken in and transcribed by the\nLLM and then it says like, okay, and I\nsay, hey, help me create a launch uh\nsite and it kind of captures like some\nof the hooks that we want to put on\nthere, right? But as you can see, I have\na lot of like ideas and chats and it's\nvery hard for me to find back some of\nthese ideas. Um, sometimes like I know I\ndiscussed something somewhere, it's\nsomewhere in in one of these chats. The\nworst is after I've like done a drill\ndown into\n>> So, you can't you can't search through\nthem or something like that. You can you\ncan search through this but I don't know\nit's I I still I I have discussed the\nsame thing so many times because it\nbecomes uh you know when you do a\ndictation you discuss something and\nmaybe you're building on something that\nyou had um discussed before uh but\nbasically it's lost somewhere in these\nchats. So with specit\num I feel like I do this in a much more\nstructured way. So before speckit I had\nthese chats I had to somehow capture all\nof these different responses from chatpt\npick out the bits that I liked remove\nthe bits that I didn't like and then\ncreate uh a document to to to\nbasically track what I'm trying to do.\nSo with specitate that starts with like\na user description. So the first step is\nto to do specify the specify command is\nto to to kick off the workflow. So user\na user description is that like a use\ncase or is it something else?\n>> Yeah, that that's that's the hardest\nthing to to know about specit is like\nwhat do I exactly say in at each uh step\nof the way. So they do have a very good\nexample on their readme. Um there's like\na detailed walk through detailed process\nwhere um they go through like the first\nthing okay once you've initialized your\nrepository and it is copied over your\ncloud commands into your git repository\nand it set everything up for you. You\ncan choose codeex, you can choose cloud,\nyou can use github copilot because this\nis a Microsoft product. And um they also\nchanged like now now they have a prefix\nonto each slash command. Um I I have not\ntalked about the constitution.\n>> Sorry Vincent you is this a Microsoft\nproduct? Did you say\n>> it's a GitHub right? GitHub is from\nMicrosoft.\n>> Oh okay. Okay.\n>> Yes. So so so the first thing is in this\nexample here like you need to do a\nfunctional specification not the the\nclarification you need to start on the\nactual spec project specification right.\nSo that's the first thing you do you do\nspecify um and that's after you've done\nconstitution. So I will talk more about\nconstitution later but first you have to\ncome up with like a prompt of what we're\ngoing to develop. You ask me what is\nthis thing that you're putting in. Uh be\nas explicit as possible about what\nyou're trying to build and why. Don't\ntalk about tech. Don't say like I want\nthe Golang uh monolithic application or\nwhatever. No, you're talking purely\nabout what you're going to develop at\nthat point. And so the great thing is\nonce you've kicked off this this initial\nprompt um it's going to come up with a\nbunch of like what's the user scenario\nwhat are the usea like what are the\npersonas um if when like user stories it\nbasically follows a template um to\n>> so it creates the use cases for you what\nreally\n>> yeah so the specify argument basically\nruns a script to create new feature\nwhich will then set up a new get branch.\nSo when you use spec specify to to\ninitialize your repo or your project\nfolder, it will create a git repo and\nthen you set up the constitution which I\nwill talk about later and then you say I\nwant to create a new feature. It sets up\na new branch for that feature and\nprepares a spec folder. So everything is\norganized. It's like um ADR on on\nsteroids or LLM driven ADR. Are you\nfamiliar with ADR?\n>> Uh yeah. Yeah. We I use them my work uh\narchitecture\nuh decision record, right?\n>> Yes. uh it's architecture decision\nrecords the same thing you run a command\nand you create a decision record\nmarkdown and then you walk through it\nwith your colleagues and then you lock\nit in right\n>> it's the same thing here um you're doing\nADR but it's all driven through LLMs so\nthe LLM is asked to run a script\n>> but this is but the uh vocabulary here\nis a feature right you call ADR is a\nfeature here\n>> I guess so I I I I've only read about\nADR I've always wanted to use it uh and\nthen I started using speckit and I was\nlike oh that's probably what ADR\nWell, I see ADR maybe I'm doing it\nwrong, but I see it more of a as a post\nactivity like a like a documentation\nthing like you've worked some options uh\nand this is why you went with this\noption you know.\n>> Yeah. But when I tried to contribute to\nAtlantis, they uh they just adopted ADR\nand they asked me to before I started\nanything create the actual you know\nproposal of what I'm going to build like\nthe feature what I'm going to build and\nand how I'm going to build it and where\nI'm going to make changes so that they\ncould agree uh with me first if this was\nthe way that they they wanted the\nproject to evolve uh for my feature to\nget a better chance to get it uh\naccepted. Right. And I I think in open\nsource that's kind of how you use ADR.\nWell, I always think the other way\naround like I I think you need to have\ncode otherwise you don't have an ADR\nreally. You need to have an\nimplementation. You need to because\nbecause you know you can you can propose\nthe moon on a stick but does it even\nwork? You'll never know.\n>> I think you don't Yeah, sure. You you\nmust have some type of credibility in in\nthe changes that you're proposing. But\nfor example, for me, I spend maybe a day\nor two reading the Atlantis source code\nand then identifying a couple of areas\nwhere I think the feature should impact\nand and then I can put my ADR in before\nI write the code to get like a a sanity\ncheck from the project maintainers,\nright? Like I'm saying I'm going to\nbuild this feature and I believe I need\nto change these code paths and they may\nvery quickly flag well actually that\ncode path kind of deprecated. um more of\nthe of the logic that you're looking at\nlives there and and we can get that\nright first. Right.\n>> Okay. I I guess I guess to be honest\nit's it is a better attack cuz early\nearly fast feedback is is a principle\nuh I also live by but uh if this project\ndoes it then then go for it I suppose.\n>> Yeah. So in my case with the Atlantic\nsituation I was like great I get to\ncreate my first ADR. I'll do it next\nweek. And then next week never happened.\nSo um anyway with specit I I was very\nmotivated with due to the recent events\nto to like really try out um how this\ncould like work and without specit this\nis what I came up with like I come with\nthe product requirement definition. I\ncreated like a V1 of what I want. I want\nthe API to look like this and then a V2\na little bit updated after more chat GPT\nchats and then I asked uh cloud go ahead\nand and did it and and cloud was very\nenthusiastic. Um it always goes like\nperfect amazing the test pass\neverything's great but nothing worked\nlike nothing worked together.\n>> Okay. So this is your this was your\nfirst way. Okay. Okay.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. This was my first way. So I\nwent into chat uh did a bunch of chats\ntried to uh you know consolidate it into\nlike a a product requirement document\ntried to capture all of the things that\nI wanted repository layout\n>> because I because I guess you went tech\nfirst here and maybe specitate is the\nother way. I I have so this is the the\nbig thing I learned about speckit is\nlike I I never really did proper product\num development and I didn't have all of\nthese users scenarios and all and edge\ncases thought out I this way like I can\ndo it for very small things like I want\nto build a terapform provider I want to\nbuild a small binary I want to build a\nterminal user interface I can even\nterminal user interface start to get a\nlittle bit dodgy but like because cloud\nis so good at like being being creative\nit kind of works like oh great cloud\ncame up with all this additional stuff\nthat I never asked for, but because the\nproject was small enough, it actually\nworked. It was able to complete it, for\nexample. But once you start hitting like\na big project where you have many moving\nparts that need to lift to like work\ntogether and and then you have\nassumptions on the left and assumptions\non the right and nothing works together,\n>> right?\n>> So, so that's where specit is really\ngreat. Um because and I there was a\nthread earlier on on Reddit about that I\njust read earlier on Reddit um which was\na way to capture the like in a monor\nrepo to capture the meaning of each\ndirectory because when you want to make\nchanges in a monor repo there's\ndefinitely responsibilities that live in\ncertain parts and if you unleash an an\nLLM it will just like try to do\neverything in one area and then\n>> you know duplicate the logic. So this is\nI I mean I I like the owners uh\nparadigm. I mean to be honest I don't\nwork on projects with that many owners\nto be honest. Uh but the the a the I\nlike the um the agent markdown is is\nquite cool because you can sprinkle them\nin in your in your code hierarchy. Um\n>> okay. Yeah. So you could you could\ncapture a bit more like don't do this\nhere. If you need to change let's go\nover there.\n>> I suppose\n>> but it's tedious to maintain it right.\nSo, so what is the approach here for for\nlike\n>> okay so so so the Reddit thread was\nmentioning we they they iterate on an\nidea and then after 20 messages back and\nforth the context kind of grows and then\nover time the LLM when it actually\nstarts implementing it to totally loses\ntrack of where things are supposed to go\nlike you said you can like manually\nmaintain agent files across your\nrepository the way that specit\napproaches this is when you get down to\nthe actual task generation it's very\nspecific specific about where you're\ngoing to change what and why. So every\nsingle task that the LLM works on has\nvery detailed like all self-contained\ninformation. Like\nthat's at the very end and and I'm\ntelling you specit takes me like easily\ntwo five hour sessions. So easily like\ntwo hours per session. So 4 hours at\nleast to get it to the point before I\neven start to write code which is very\nfrustrating when you start because\nyou're so used to you know jump into\ncloud and have it generate a whole bunch\nof code and now you have to like go\nthrough all of these edge cases you know\nreview the functional requirements you\nknow do research and then align the plan\nand the research against those\nfunctional requirements and validate it\nand and and the first time my first\nfeature which is like the start like\nbootstrap the mon repo and build some\nbasic functionality\nit I totally like yes yes yes yes okay\nyes next on the first few steps because\nI also didn't even know what like most\nof those steps were meant to do um and\nand so I I ran up the the implementation\npart became very painful because specit\ndivides it and you you specify the\nfeature you you know start to formulate\na plan where you actually define what is\nthe text stack that you want to use that\ngets you know does some research to find\nout more about the libraries that you're\ninteracting with and how they integrate\nwith each\nUm and then once you've got the\nresearch, the plan, some data, models,\nthen you start to generate the tasks and\nthen you go through a couple of\niterations of actually analyzing very\nvery carefully how those functional\nrequirements map back to those tasks and\nif everything is like covered in terms\nof like um requirements and and and\n>> and I did like like I said the first\ntime I completely ignored that iteration\nand I went straight into implementation\nand halfway through I realized I made a\nbig mistake. and like half of the code\nwas actually not not quite right and I\nhad to go back and try to make changes\nand I found it a bit hard to like uh\nadjust the course at that point because\nI hadn't done the a lot of the research\nup front and of course\n>> the idea is like how can I know that\nI've got everything right from the start\nright um you can't but\n>> um with this approach now with like\nreally going into a lot of the edge\ncases the the feature that I did last\ntime which was like adding\num labels on terraform states literally\nI think two days to get the specs right\nand then I went to sleep at like 9:00\np.m. Ask cloud to start implementing\nmaybe woke up around like midnight to\nask codeex to review and continue the\nimplementation and then by morning 7:00\na.m. kicked off another final\nimplementation round and by lunch it was\nfully implemented and it hadn't\nencountered any issues and I went\nstraight into the UI and it worked and\nit was like holy crazy.\n>> So this is really interesting. So\n>> what you said there where you got clawed\nto kick off the implementation.\nUm is is that like a specit thing to\nlike you know specit implement? Okay.\n>> Yes.\nAnd then is it also a spec kit thing to\nlike get codeex another model to review\nit?\n>> Uh not not explicitly but they do say\nthat it's an interactive process. So\nthey give you these starter commands to\ncreate those documents and you're they\nalso say like don't expect this like\n>> um don't expect the first response to be\nwhat you want right you must actually\nvalidate and go through it. Um and then\nyou know the first thing is after it\nwent through this prompt it will then\nhave a couple of needs clarification. It\nwill generate edge cases like you may\nsay here they talk about task taskify a\nteam productivity platform should allow\nusers to create projects and then it\nwill create like um clarification\nquestions like what if two users create\nthis project with the same name like\nwhat what happens because you haven't\nclarified that right what if the user\ndeletes a project that is um has a lot\nof tasks assigned to it how like is\nthere a delete cascade in the background\nlike how does that work so you have to\ngo through a lot of these um details.\n>> Well, okay. So, this this sounds great.\nAbsolutely great for like bootstrapping\na project. But what what happens if you\nthe uh just out of interest if there was\nan existing project like say you have an\nexisting project and you want to\nspecitify it? Is that possible?\n>> They do have a section about introducing\nit on existing projects. I have to say\nlike this YouTube video here on the on\nthe on the root p on the landing page or\nthe root rate me it takes you to the\nchannel of of one of the main advocates\nbehind it and if you look at his posts\nfrom the like his YouTube videos from\nthe like week last week and literally I\nthink 3 days ago he did another update\nbecause they changed a couple of the\ncommands they added new command into it\nwhich is a checklist command for your um\nvalidation so you can validate that you\nhave really covered every area. Um, so,\nso these YouTube videos are amazing and\nhe does talk about like how to go and\nuse it into an existing project. Yeah, I\nthink this is when I talk to people that\nuse Ko, they say that this is very\nsimilar to Ko um but it's completely\nindependent from like a specific IDE,\nright? You it works with multiple uh LLM\nagents. It uses the CLI under the hood.\nSo, cloud is actually calling the cloud\nCLI to do some like summarizations and\nthings like that under the hood. So when\nyou mentioned Kira that that's uh sorry\nI I I not too sure what that means.\n>> Kirro is an AWS product that kind of\nlaunched the idea of specdriven\ndevelopment right they they really said\nlike people are using Almstrong uh the\nspecification is where you should start\nand they build a whole IDE around it.\nAh, so Speckit and Kirro, how are they\nrelated? Just\n>> not at all.\n>> They're not related. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So, so, so Kira is a commercial\nproduct from AWS. It's an ID with a\nsubscription with a subscription and\nthey use Sonale as well. Um, but they\nprovide you they have like nice little\nhooks inside the IDE. For example, if\nyou have a task, there's a little green\nbutton that appears around it. So, you\ncan click start implementing this task.\nand the LLM and start implementing it.\nThat's kind of like you see that that's\non the demo right now.\n>> Yeah. It's kind of like pretty cool.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. Because I mean Copilot has that,\nyou know, you can like save and\n>> Yeah. Or\n>> I I think I think the specit with GitHub\ncopilot does a similar thing, but I'm\nnot using GitHub copilot. I'm just using\nthe cloud code with because I'm used to\ncloud code. Yeah.\n>> Cool. Man, this is this is mind-blowing\nstuff, man. So, okay. So you got your\nspeck kit, you got your task breakdown,\nyou you kick it off overnight, you get\ncodeex to review it. So how do you kick\noff codeex by the way? Is it is it just\na like what you\n>> originally I always use the codeex ID on\nthe side here? So I just install the the\nthe plugin into in here. I need to\nupdate it I guess. Um so on one side I\nhave copilot the GitHub you know\nprovided. I have a seat uh provided by\norganization as well and then I have my\npersonal codeex here. um that I have\nthat I that is\nyeah that that's my codeex.\n>> Okay.\n>> I don't know what to say about it.\n>> So so your codeex is specified like how\ndo you know that it's like\n>> yeah so so codeex only supported prompt\narguments since last week. So the the\nspeckit has this argument at the start\nhere right the user input the user will\nprovide some input. So when you kick off\nthe command here um\nwhen you kick off specify yeah this is\nclassic cloud code doing the disco in\nthe terminal um so when you say like\nwe're we're we are going to revise the\nfiltering\nlibrary or something like that right I\ndon't know that's actually not a good\nspec because it should not be related to\nthe there's no functional requirement\nthere's no that's just pure tech that's\na really that spec actually. Okay, it\nshould really be about like the user\nfiltering experience is bad. Uh the\nperform like when a user clicks the\nfilter it takes you know minutes before\nthe result appears and then it will\ngenerate user stories and edge cases and\nlike what are the benchmarks that we\nneed to create what are the tests to\nvalidate that that it is implemented\ncorrectly and then we can go into the\ntechnical research like okay we find\nsome hot pots we need to add some\nindexes into the database and do things\nlike that. So that would be in the in\nthe plan phase. So specify the first\nphase you say the functional requirement\nwhy do you need to do this what you want\nto do exactly. Then you do plan where it\nwill kick off um several documents and\nand no actually before sorry before you\ngo into plan um the specify will have\ngenerated edge cases and will have\nquestions like what happens if uh if\nthis or that right and then it will ask\nyou clarification about how do you want\nto handle those like are you okay with\nthis um and when you click up and for\nthat also there's there's um an LLM\nprompt which will basically go through\nthe document find any areas that needs\nclarification and then give you three or\nfour options on how you may want to\naddress this. So there's a question\noption A, B or C. So because we all use\nNLM ultimately to answer those\nquestions, right? Yeah, I don't really\nI'm not really sure like what are some\nof the common ways that I could solve\nthis and suspect it will give you like\nthree or four uh clarification options\nthere and then you can\n>> so but going back to codec soc.\nSo you basically run some commands in\nclaude and you run uh the same sort of\ncommands in in codeex alternately.\n>> Yeah. So codec since last week has these\narguments. So I I I started using the\nCLI and what I noticed is that the CLI\nin CEX never wants to execute the\nscripts. Maybe this is some training\nthat OpenAI did to prevent like uh\nprompt injection attacks because there's\nbeen a few. So, so Codex even if the\nprompt says you will run this script, it\ndoesn't run the script. So, so now I'm\nlike confirm to me you will run this\nparticular script and that works and it\nsays yes I will run it and then actually\nwhen I say\n>> um I I I trigger the prompt. So you see\nthe prompt was expanded here. So I call\nthe prompt command and then it says user\ninput is here. We need to identify\nactually I left the user input blank it\nlooks like. Um I also noticed that if I\nput too much codeex will just lose half\nthe prompt. I don't know. So maybe I\nstopped putting\n>> prompts. So on the subject of security,\nI'm not going to lie, when I use Claude,\nI sometimes specify, you know, skip\ndangerously skip permissions because I\nhate having to uh, you know, press\nenter.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So do you have a different approach to\nto security?\n>> Uh, depends on what repository I work\non. If it's my own that I just\nbootstrapped, I'm okay with like most of\nit. Yeah.\n>> So you just skip all the permissions.\n>> I don't run MCPS or barely any because I\nbelieve that MCPS pollute the uh context\nwindow and the context window is scarce.\nSo I try to keep as much of the context\nwindow free and so I only one MCP. Now\n>> on on the on the subject of context\nwindow like um I do think the\ninteraction with MCP is quite good\nbecause it tells you when it runs the\ntool. It tells you what the input is and\nthe output. Um, at least with Claude,\nit's quite clear to me, but like to me\nto me like a lot of these prompt\nprompting things,\nuh, I mean, they're quite verbose. I\nmean, like when you when you're running\nthese commands, are you actually viewing\nall the input? Are you like like do you\nhave a a finger on the whole context\nwindow or do you letting it do its\nthing?\n>> It depends. Like I used to be very\nhands-on with the implementation phase.\nDefinitely when I wasn't going very\ndetailed with like all the educations\nand functional requirements I started I\nrealized I need to stop it to do the\nwrong thing. However like the last\nfeature that I let it implement like\nliterally I went to sleep. So I after I\nfeel a lot more confident about the I\nran the validate process like four times\nliterally I think I use 50 I think at\nthis point I use almost like 40% of my\nweekly token budget just on spec\ngeneration and and and like validation\nof the specs and then the actual\nimplementation takes 30% or so. Yeah.\n>> Wow. So, and then your spec um what is\nthe source of truth there? Like it's is\nit sitting in in a markdown file\nsomewhere?\n>> Yeah. So, that's a that's a pattern I\ndid before specit as well because cloud\nis great when you first start start\nusing cloud. You go like let's go in\nplan mode and create a bunch of to-dos\nand then it ticks nicely through those\nto-dos. If you get stuck on something,\nyou can like re like help it, you can\nnudge it along. You're following along\nand all that, right? But very quickly\nwhen the projects gets bigger, you you\nident you realize that those to-dos like\nthey're sometimes based on\nmisconceptions or or you run out of\ncontext and then you need to compact and\nthen the compact summary throws away a\nlot of the stuff that you originally was\npart of the reasons why the to-dos\nexisted. So so those to-dos don't scale\nand so I started say asking cloud like\nokay check off the things that you've\ncompleted like when it started\napproaching context window limits and\nwrite it down for handover. I call it\nlike we need to hand over to someone,\nright? So, write everything down into a\nmarkdown. Um, and then I would open a a\nnew cloud session. Well, I didn't know\nhow to use the clear comp um command\nproperly, but I used a new cloud window\nand then I would just like read the\nhandover document. Um, there's a couple\nof to-dos there.\n>> There's there's a command called\ncompact, right? I think you\n>> Yes, but I found that the compact throws\naway like too many details. definitely\nsome of the initial research that you've\ndone and some of the reasoning why the\nto-dos exists and then if you you know\nhalfway through are going down the wrong\npath and then the original you know\nlogic is gone then the to-dos no longer\nmakes sense and then cloud starts to be\nvery creative and then it nothing works\nanymore. So that's why I already had\nthis this experience um of of throwing\naway contexts easily and that's\nsomething that people say like\n>> you know your context is like a jewel\nyou need to craft it very right to get\nit into the right you know data that you\nwant and actually cloud added a lot of\ncommands for you like the double escape\nif you are uh on cloud you can double\ndouble escape and you can rewind back to\none of the previous like context\nsnapshots or something like that\n>> I didn't know that\n>> res and you can even this one actually\ndouble escape is restore the code or\nconversation from a point before. This\nis something\n>> escape. Wow, I knew about I just learned\nabout shift tab I think. I think is it\nshift tab?\n>> Yeah, shift tab. Shift tab is like the\nthe amazing experience when you first\nstart using cloud code like because you\nactually get to you know determine the\nplan and the to-dos before you start\nwriting down anything, right? But again\nlike the plan mode hits it limit when\nyou start building right large\nrepositories. And so that's where, you\nknow, writing things down into a\nmarkdown for handover really helps. And\nthen specit um really formalizes that\nworkflow because it really puts in like\nfirst we're going to get the functional\nrequirements, then we're going to go\nthrough it and we're going to eliminate\nanything that needs clarification. It's\nliterally one of the checkboxes. If you\ntry to run the plan command or the plan\nprompt, normally cloud will see the\ninstruction that if there's anything\nthat still needs clarification, abort\nstraight back to the user. You need to\ngo clarify. Wow. Yeah,\n>> but the funny thing is it's LLMs, right?\nSo, so when I do this with codecs,\nsometimes it sees this and just goes\nlike, \"Yeah, whatever.\" And just keeps\ngoing. It's like, \"Come on, man. There's\nIt's right there. Don't continue if\nthere's still items to be clarified.\"\n>> Sorry if I asked you this question\nbefore, but how did you come across Spec\nKit?\n>> Um, how did I come across it?\n>> Like hacker news or something?\n>> No, I'm I'm I'm on like a lot of\nReddits. I'm on cloud code Reddit, on\nentropic, on the OpenAI Reddit, like the\nsubreddits, I mean, and I think it was\nposted there. I definitely saw all of\nthe like on the AWS subreddit about Ko.\nI read a lot about specri development. I\ndidn't I was building something at the\ntime with cloud code and I was quite\nhappy the way it was going. But it\ndefinitely resonated with me because I\nwas doing already those handover\ndocuments basically define what needs to\nbe developed. I just didn't realize how\nhow detailed the process was. Um\n>> because yeah so so what what you asked\nme earlier is like how does this\nactually work on an existing project and\nwhen you need to like adopt things I I\ndon't know\n>> okay\n>> because I I started from scratch but I\nam using it on a large project right now\nand it is able to add in new features\nquite\n>> I think we're bouncing around a bit like\nI I still don't actually understand\nwhere your your specs live. They just\nlive in the specs folder there.\n>> Okay. So, so the first step is you\nspecify what you're trying to build, why\nyou're trying to build it, and then it\nwill when you kick off that pro prompt,\nit will create a branch and it will\ncreate a folder in the specs directory.\nAnd so then you're working on a branch\non that specific feature, right? So this\nis one of the things people mention on\nReddit is like how does this scale\nacross a team like how do you keep track\nof like multiple people and their spec\nbranches? So I also don't know that like\nthis is a question that my colleague\nasked me when I I showed it to him. um\nlike how will this like do you have\neveryone working on their own spec\nbranches and so on? How do you\ncollaborate on these branches?\n>> Um because it's going to be\n>> I can't answer those questions.\n>> If it's a fastmoving project, it might\nbe a real pain to to merge, right?\n>> There might be a lot of different uh so\nso I think that's one important thing.\nAside from the agents, there's the\nconstellation uh which is part of the\nmemory. So it creates a dot. So on one\nside it creates your commands under your\ncloud or your agent. So it has the\nprepared prompts there. Then it creates\na special specify folder where it has\nthe templates. For example, when it\nneeds to write a new spec, it it has a\nvery detailed plan template. So again,\nthis is kind of like one shot or nshot\nLLM usage where you tell it like look at\nthis and now replicate it. Now look at\nthis then followed my example. Follow my\nexample. Right? So it say read this then\ndo this. Read this then do this. Right?\nSo it it follows cloud is great. It\nfollows this structure really really\nwell. Codeex sometimes gives you a\ncompletely different template like\ncompletely nothing like it and sometimes\nchip 5 just\n>> what do you mean\n>> very nicely follows it.\n>> It like it doesn't read\n>> it doesn't follow it. I don't know why\nSona is doing a great job but uh that's\nwhy that's why I have very dedicated\nlike if I want\n>> so so what is doing a good job? Sonai\n>> sonet son um is a French way to say\nsonet uh\n>> sonet means a tune or doesn't it or like\na\n>> it's a it's a type of pros I think like\nif you write\n>> son\n>> okay yeah\n>> so I'm going to I'm going to be I'm\ngoing to say this is a French word\noriginally right\n>> yeah just like\n>> proson\n>> uh\nso you're using four you're using 4.5 I\nmean when it comes to model choices is\nare you quite are you picky about it? Do\nyou go son for the 4.5?\nSo this is the thing right these things\nchange so fast um that's why I also\navoid MCPS and other stuff like I trust\nthem to provide the best working\nenvironment I cannot keep up with it so\nwhen they say use Sony 4.5 I'll be okay\nand they and uh and and that's the thing\nwhere a lot of people last week were\nvery upset and because they are kind of\ntelling people not to use opus and they\nmake you blow your budget if you use\nopus they charge it double right they\nreally want people to use Sonet and\npeople are like oh Son is not as good as\nOpus blah blah blah but\n>> they really craft code and the context\nand the tooling everything around the\nmodel and they're saying really don't\nuse don't use sorry don't use opus so\n>> that's good to hear because like I had\nlike some FOMO that I'm just not using\nmaking\n>> the right choices but I it has it has to\nbe auto going forward I mean it's\n>> I agree like it's it's a full-time job\nlike I watch some YouTube channels like\ngo coder who very frequently breaks down\nhe has his own benchmark um where he\nsays okay I've tested Quen I've tested\nGLM I've tested JGPT OSS uh for local\nLLMs um and and he goes into great\ndetail and I used to like wait until\nmade a video to actually figure out is\nthere like an improvement is there a\nsignificant improvement in his benchmark\nthat would justify me to spend time to\nplay with it and and I've actually\nstarted um I mean at some point you just\nwant to get the worked on. You don't\nhave the time to just keep reading about\nall the LLMs and\n>> cuz cuz every time there's like, oh,\nactually you need to use XML now. Yeah,\nyou you should pro you write your prom.\nOh, actually YAML is much better. Oh,\nno, no, JSON is the way.\n>> I'm sure you're making some crazy\nexamples there. Anyway, I I think\n>> No, no, that's real. That's real like\nReddit posts about this is my JSON\n>> formatted. Yes. No, it's not a\n>> that's like that's like a virus. Like\nyou start using XML and then uh\nheadache. Yeah.\n>> Um\nOh, I think you g I think you gave me at\nleast a very good overview of uh spec\nkit there. So maybe maybe we should we\nshould go back to to uh the value add on\nTerraform.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–3:29]\nWelcome everybody. It's it's Vincent and I just chatting about infrastructure and AI and uh what what what what's fun and cool I suppose. Um Vincent, you you wanted to show me something. I I know you've been itching. Straight on to the demo. Yeah, I can. Um give me a minute. I'll cut this out. >> Are you on Are you on Mac? cuz the >> Yeah, I am. >> Okay. >> It's It follows me. It >> You got center stage enabled. >> Yeah. I have no idea. It just works, right? >> Sorry, I have to uh plug some I have a pump. My AC pump. My AC is um in a funny position and it needs to pump the water out up. So, there's a pump, but the pump is a bit dodgy. >> What's your temperature there? It looks like you're sweaty. And >> yeah, I went to the gym this morning. So it is it is quite hot here. >> Yeah. Uh but I did so that's another that's a great thing about AI but and those budgets of AI by the way because I hit my budget like I have a 5 hour session and then I hit my budget maybe in two hours and so then I have 3 hours to go to the gym, right? I mean the amount of work I get done in two hours is is pretty much the same what I what I would do in a day. So it's pretty great. >> Yeah. Yeah, I I never thought about like that, but yeah, like I'm a big fan of like uh being careful with your time and you know the Pomodoro technique where you just jam in stuff. So if is >> So is the AI spend limit or Claude working the same way? Which plan are you on again? >> I'm on the like the lowest paid plan 20 bucks around Codex and Cloud. >> Sorry. Oh, and it and it basically works by by time. Like if you smashing your your token, >> the moment you send your first message, a 5 hour session starts >> and then you get a certain token budget within those 5 hours depending on your plan. And so it will remind you now they added like a nice usage command since they did sonet 4.5 last week and cloud code version two. So they added a lot more um context management and notifications about your usage um when and and also they added more I think they enforcing the weekly limits stronger and um basically within 5 hours you have a budget you keep track of how it's going so I can see like oh I'm at 50% let me maybe do a little bit more myself instead of just asking cloud to do it or or like um switch over to Codeex which often do. Um, so that >> I I tried Codeex I think after you talking about it and it is a lot better experience than I remember. >> Yeah, it has improved a lot but I don't use the CLI. Uh…\n\n[slide:2] [3:08–10:10]\nin uh in codeex because I can, you know, put it on full agent mode and it seems to use its tools and utility like better like when it needs to edit a file. >> Maybe you should show share the screen. show show it perhaps >> I think cuz that would be more interesting for people. Okay, so this is a project that I've been working on since the last time we talked where we talked about some of the events happening around Terraform states and state management open tacos announcement and I've talked to those people and I wanted to get some features in but I have not been able to reach them and so I started decided like it can't be that hard right I even commented on one guy like he posted like oh when you start a new project it's so exciting because you get to make a text tech decisions and then maybe you will regret those and I said like well cloud will oneshot it anyway so who cares so I I I thought if I I talk big like that let me try it right let me see if I can oneot this thing >> I'm I'm curious to see what's in your claw directory in your codeex which is just session management or something >> so this is what spec this is speckit um speckit gives you a command to bootstrap a repository to use speckit this kind of funny Now because cloud code uh has announced plug-in marketplace so you can look at specit like a plug-in market sorry like a like a marketplace plug-in it comes with a bunch of commands basically prompt templates a bunch of scripts and um yeah that's pretty much it like it uses templates for some uh specification files that you may want to build. So, so this cloud folder here that has these commands, this is all prepared by specit. >> Oh, I see. So, it just So, what's a command then? It's like a it's like a prompt. >> I will try. Hold on. Um I I I want to open the the specit website. Yeah. So, um a command is like a prepared prompt. It can have arguments. So you can call those you know like when you do slash you can um call those like analyze. >> Yes. So then you all of your files that you put in here under the commands folder will show up as slashcomands in your cloud code and you can also have arguments. >> Do do you use that a lot? I mean do you actually >> speckit is completely built around this workflow. So I've never used it until I use specit. So you basically I mean so you find yourself going analyze clarify constitution whatever that means in plan >> I don't know I've never used kro but the idea let me go spec kit let me open the…\n\n[slide:3] [9:49–16:51]\nstructured way. So before speckit I had these chats I had to somehow capture all of these different responses from chatpt pick out the bits that I liked remove the bits that I didn't like and then create uh a document to to to basically track what I'm trying to do. So with specitate that starts with like a user description. So the first step is to to do specify the specify command is to to to kick off the workflow. So user a user description is that like a use case or is it something else? >> Yeah, that that's that's the hardest thing to to know about specit is like what do I exactly say in at each uh step of the way. So they do have a very good example on their readme. Um there's like a detailed walk through detailed process where um they go through like the first thing okay once you've initialized your repository and it is copied over your cloud commands into your git repository and it set everything up for you. You can choose codeex, you can choose cloud, you can use github copilot because this is a Microsoft product. And um they also changed like now now they have a prefix onto each slash command. Um I I have not talked about the constitution. >> Sorry Vincent you is this a Microsoft product? Did you say >> it's a GitHub right? GitHub is from Microsoft. >> Oh okay. Okay. >> Yes. So so so the first thing is in this example here like you need to do a functional specification not the the clarification you need to start on the actual spec project specification right. So that's the first thing you do you do specify um and that's after you've done constitution. So I will talk more about constitution later but first you have to come up with like a prompt of what we're going to develop. You ask me what is this thing that you're putting in. Uh be as explicit as possible about what you're trying to build and why. Don't talk about tech. Don't say like I want the Golang uh monolithic application or whatever. No, you're talking purely about what you're going to develop at that point. And so the great thing is once you've kicked off this this initial prompt um it's going to come up with a bunch of like what's the user scenario what are the usea like what are the personas um if when like user stories it basically follows a template um to >> so it creates the use cases for you what really >> yeah so the specify argument basically runs a script to create new feature which will then set up a new get branch. So when you use spec specify to to initialize your repo or…\n\n[slide:4] [16:30–23:29]\ndo it for very small things like I want to build a terapform provider I want to build a small binary I want to build a terminal user interface I can even terminal user interface start to get a little bit dodgy but like because cloud is so good at like being being creative it kind of works like oh great cloud came up with all this additional stuff that I never asked for, but because the project was small enough, it actually worked. It was able to complete it, for example. But once you start hitting like a big project where you have many moving parts that need to lift to like work together and and then you have assumptions on the left and assumptions on the right and nothing works together, >> right? >> So, so that's where specit is really great. Um because and I there was a thread earlier on on Reddit about that I just read earlier on Reddit um which was a way to capture the like in a monor repo to capture the meaning of each directory because when you want to make changes in a monor repo there's definitely responsibilities that live in certain parts and if you unleash an an LLM it will just like try to do everything in one area and then >> you know duplicate the logic. So this is I I mean I I like the owners uh paradigm. I mean to be honest I don't work on projects with that many owners to be honest. Uh but the the a the I like the um the agent markdown is is quite cool because you can sprinkle them in in your in your code hierarchy. Um >> okay. Yeah. So you could you could capture a bit more like don't do this here. If you need to change let's go over there. >> I suppose >> but it's tedious to maintain it right. So, so what is the approach here for for like >> okay so so so the Reddit thread was mentioning we they they iterate on an idea and then after 20 messages back and forth the context kind of grows and then over time the LLM when it actually starts implementing it to totally loses track of where things are supposed to go like you said you can like manually maintain agent files across your repository the way that specit approaches this is when you get down to the actual task generation it's very specific specific about where you're going to change what and why. So every single task that the LLM works on has very detailed like all self-contained information. Like that's at the very end and and I'm telling you specit takes me like easily two five hour sessions. So easily like two hours per session. So 4 hours at least to get it to the point before I…\n\n[slide:5] [23:08–30:08]\nbecause they changed a couple of the commands they added new command into it which is a checklist command for your um validation so you can validate that you have really covered every area. Um, so, so these YouTube videos are amazing and he does talk about like how to go and use it into an existing project. Yeah, I think this is when I talk to people that use Ko, they say that this is very similar to Ko um but it's completely independent from like a specific IDE, right? You it works with multiple uh LLM agents. It uses the CLI under the hood. So, cloud is actually calling the cloud CLI to do some like summarizations and things like that under the hood. So when you mentioned Kira that that's uh sorry I I I not too sure what that means. >> Kirro is an AWS product that kind of launched the idea of specdriven development right they they really said like people are using Almstrong uh the specification is where you should start and they build a whole IDE around it. Ah, so Speckit and Kirro, how are they related? Just >> not at all. >> They're not related. Okay. >> Yeah. So, so, so Kira is a commercial product from AWS. It's an ID with a subscription with a subscription and they use Sonale as well. Um, but they provide you they have like nice little hooks inside the IDE. For example, if you have a task, there's a little green button that appears around it. So, you can click start implementing this task. and the LLM and start implementing it. That's kind of like you see that that's on the demo right now. >> Yeah. It's kind of like pretty cool. Yeah. >> Yeah. Because I mean Copilot has that, you know, you can like save and >> Yeah. Or >> I I think I think the specit with GitHub copilot does a similar thing, but I'm not using GitHub copilot. I'm just using the cloud code with because I'm used to cloud code. Yeah. >> Cool. Man, this is this is mind-blowing stuff, man. So, okay. So you got your speck kit, you got your task breakdown, you you kick it off overnight, you get codeex to review it. So how do you kick off codeex by the way? Is it is it just a like what you >> originally I always use the codeex ID on the side here? So I just install the the the plugin into in here. I need to update it I guess. Um so on one side I have copilot the GitHub you know provided. I have a seat uh provided by organization as well and then I have my personal codeex here. um that I have that I that is yeah that that's my codeex. >> Okay. >> I don't know what to say about it. >> So so…\n\n[slide:6] [29:48–33:58]\ninteraction with MCP is quite good because it tells you when it runs the tool. It tells you what the input is and the output. Um, at least with Claude, it's quite clear to me, but like to me to me like a lot of these prompt prompting things, uh, I mean, they're quite verbose. I mean, like when you when you're running these commands, are you actually viewing all the input? Are you like like do you have a a finger on the whole context window or do you letting it do its thing? >> It depends. Like I used to be very hands-on with the implementation phase. Definitely when I wasn't going very detailed with like all the educations and functional requirements I started I realized I need to stop it to do the wrong thing. However like the last feature that I let it implement like literally I went to sleep. So I after I feel a lot more confident about the I ran the validate process like four times literally I think I use 50 I think at this point I use almost like 40% of my weekly token budget just on spec generation and and and like validation of the specs and then the actual implementation takes 30% or so. Yeah. >> Wow. So, and then your spec um what is the source of truth there? Like it's is it sitting in in a markdown file somewhere? >> Yeah. So, that's a that's a pattern I did before specit as well because cloud is great when you first start start using cloud. You go like let's go in plan mode and create a bunch of to-dos and then it ticks nicely through those to-dos. If you get stuck on something, you can like re like help it, you can nudge it along. You're following along and all that, right? But very quickly when the projects gets bigger, you you ident you realize that those to-dos like they're sometimes based on misconceptions or or you run out of context and then you need to compact and then the compact summary throws away a lot of the stuff that you originally was part of the reasons why the to-dos existed. So so those to-dos don't scale and so I started say asking cloud like okay check off the things that you've completed like when it started approaching context window limits and write it down for handover. I call it like we need to hand over to someone, right? So, write everything down into a markdown. Um, and then I would open a a new cloud session. Well, I didn't know how to use the clear comp um command properly, but I used a new cloud window and then I…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This clip is a hands-on conversation and demo about using a spec-driven workflow to build and extend infrastructure code with large language model (LLM) tooling. The speaker walks through the motivations, the CLI-driven commands that scaffold a repo and a feature, the step-by-step spec → plan → task → implement loop, the ways this changes how you capture requirements, and the practical tradeoffs (time, tokens, and context management). Concrete numbers and timings are given for sessions, budgets, and how much time/token spend went into specification vs implementation. Two brief verbatim excerpts are included below that capture the speaker’s framing and a recurring problem the workflow addresses: *\"the code becomes more of like an after like an artifact\"* and *\"what's data without a schema? You know what's worse is data that used to have a schema but the schema is gone.\"*\n\n[slide:1]\n## Opening: why a spec-first workflow\nThe conversation starts with why the speaker switched toward a spec-driven process: LLMs accelerate work but also expose brittle, context-limited interactions that make adhoc code generation unreliable for larger projects. The host notes practical constraints: the cloud assistant runs sessions with fixed time/token budgets (a typical session described as five hours and a low-tier paid plan mentioned), so users must manage tokens and split work across models or sessions. Early remarks set up the need for a more structured, repeatable approach rather than jump-to-code prompts.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Tooling: a CLI-based spec scaffolder\nThe demo focuses on a repository scaffolded by a CLI-driven toolkit that adds a commands folder (slash-commands for the cloud IDE) and templates for spec files. The toolkit exposes prepared prompts as commands with arguments and installs into your repo so the cloud IDE shows them as slash-commands. The workflow is organized around a sequence of commands: constitution (project-level rules), specify (feature description), plan, taskify, implement and validate. The tool is IDE-agnostic: it uses the CLI under the hood and can target different LLM agents or plugins via configured prompts.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Specify: capture intent before tech\nThe first formal step is specify: write a functional spec about what you want and why, explicitly avoiding tech-stack details. The tool auto-generates personas, user scenarios and user stories from that input and creates a new git branch and a spec folder for the feature. This enforces treating specifications and test suites as primary artifacts—code becomes an output produced against those specs. The speaker frames the problem the workflow solves with the observation that unstructured notes and chat logs get lost and that structured specs help preserve reasoning and edge-case handling. *\"what's data without a schema? You know what's worse is data that used to have a schema but the schema is gone.\"*\n\n[slide:4]\n## Plan, research, taskify: heavy up-front work\nUnlike free-form LLM generation, the toolkit emphasizes researching libraries, mapping functional requirements to data models, and turning the plan into small, self-contained tasks that include where and why a change will occur. For small utilities the quick, creative generation can work, but larger projects with multiple moving parts require careful upfront work to avoid divergent assumptions. The speaker reports spending multiple multi-hour sessions (described as two 2–5 hour sessions) to get specs, research, and task definitions into a state where automated implementation can be trusted.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Implementation, review, and IDE integration\nOnce specs and tasks are validated the workflow supports an interactive implementation phase where one model implements tasks and another reviews. The repo layout includes templates and a checklist command for validation to ensure edge cases are covered. The creator found that some LLMs follow the templates and prompts reliably while others diverge; the CLI arguments feature helps pass explicit user inputs into commands. The tool also creates a spec branch per feature, so each feature’s spec, tasks, and changes live alongside code in version control.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Source-of-truth, context limits, and costs\nThe recommended source-of-truth is the spec markdowns residing in the repo—these are the handover documents used when context windows start to saturate. The speaker warns that compacting or summarizing chat sessions can lose important research and reasoning, so writing explicit markdown handovers reduces drift. Practical costs were called out: spec generation and validations consumed a large fraction of weekly token/time budgets (the example given was roughly 40% of tokens on spec generation and validation, and ~30% on implementation). The workflow adds overhead up front but the speaker reports a successful run where two days of spec work plus overnight implementation produced a working feature the next day, demonstrating the tradeoff: more time invested up front, higher confidence and fewer integration surprises later."
