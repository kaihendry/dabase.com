    "content": "Transcript:\nOkay. Ralph Wigan number one on the\nagenda.\n>> Well, you put it number one. Don't act\nsurprised. You expected me to bump it\ndown.\n>> Well, to be honest, I wanted to put it\nlike\nsecond to uh you demoing the the thing\nthat you're trying to demo to me\n>> cuz you're afraid we're going to run out\nof time.\n>> Oh my god, there's a lot to cover and I\nneed to basically take my kids off in 10\nminutes. But like maybe\n>> you call me 10 minutes before you go and\nthen\n>> I don't know if you like like if you had\n10 minutes and you wanted to talk about\nsomething what you want to talk about\nyou choose\n>> the memes around Ralph Wigum.\nI like him.\n>> What what is Ralph Wigum?\n>> Okay. So I saw a very niceation\n>> where Ralph Wigum is a Simpson\ncharacter. the guy who sits on the train\nin the class and that ate the crayons\nand the very famous meme where he's on\nthe bus and the bus is about to crash\nand he goes like I'm in danger. It's\nlike it's it's a classic character like\na clueless character. Um, and so it's\nkind of fitting for the fact that you\njust put it in put cloud in a loop. And\nI like it um because one of the\nbreakdowns of why it is successful\nis basically\nit just means that um\nthat the models have become so good.\nI I thought putting them in a loop was\npretty much what Gast Town was doing\nwith a little bit of coordination.\n>> No, no, no. Gast Town. So I I like the\nsecond blog post that that Steve Jger g\ndid, which is way more the background\nthan how it came to be what it is. I\nthink that's a gentle introduction to\nGast Town. So he has the original\nannouncement. Here's Gast Town. Cost\n$600 a month to run it. It's crazy.\nDon't do it. Caveat. Watch out. And um\nand then he did a second and with a full\nbreakdown. It's very hard to follow\nbecause it's like introducing all of\nthese different concepts but using you\nknow names that don't make sense like\nbcats and and uh scrapyard and towns and\nthe way that towns communicate. I still\ndon't understand the difference between\nlike why can't you just say agents are\nmailing each other? No, we have to see\nbullot bulls live.\n>> I think I I often think to myself that\nuh in our industry terminology is\nactually\na big part of what we do, right? Using\nthe right words is the right and and AI\nagents\n>> is already kind of overloaded as\n>> sensitive to words. Oh, it's\n>> I mean like agents I' I've seen if you\nlike I don't know if you go along on\nYouTube and you and you like some people\nhave like weird ideas what agents are. I\nthink and like if if if you define it if\nyou call your agent PCAT and you define\nwhat PCA does exactly and what where it\nlives exactly and how it works exactly.\nI think\n>> it's very hard because then you're\nintroducing all these new concepts and\nthey don't have any relationship. But\nthat's what a a new a new idea a\ngroundbreaking idea will probably end up\ndoing, right? We'll invent three new\nwords in the process.\n>> So this is why I I'm I'm defending Steve\nin his in his crazy naming.\n>> Yeah. But I have a history here of\ncoming into an organization as a DevOps\nengineer and being told to de deploy\nOkali and having to scram cuz first off\nyou weren't involved in the original\ndesign of Okali. You have no idea what\nOkalai is supposed to be. Then you have\nto find\n>> So okali are the what you call the\nfacets of the eyes of a bee and it was\nbasically the optic uh character\nrecognition engine for scanning receipts\nat the supermarket at the team that I\nwas working at. So you see how annoying\nit is. Uh and then another thing that's\nvery annoying. Yes, naming is is is is\ndifficult, but for me it was like just\ntell me that you want the OCR scanner\nmicroser deployed, right? Don't tell me\nI have to go and figure out what OKAI is\n>> at the same time. All these calls and\nall this nonsense,\n>> but at the same time\n>> Yeah, but that that's kind of different.\nI mean, that's like a project name as\nopposed to But yeah, I get I get I get\nwhat you're saying. It can be it can\nwork the other way very easily.\nYeah, I mean it makes sense I guess if\nyou if they are in in a in the nom\nnomature like it was an or an an\norganization called Honorsby. So it was\nOkalai and Beehive and Beehive was a\nproduct catalog but you know\n>> Oh god no.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But you know you cringe the\nmoment I say this. I cringe the moment I\nread like Paul Catz and all and then he\nsays to avoid copyright he mixes Mad Max\nterminology with others uh to make sure\nthat like no single um enterprise can go\nafter you know him for copyright claims\nor trademarks. He said, \"No wonder.\" And\nno one. Anyway, what I was trying to say\nis, and we were getting back to Ralph\nWiggum, is that\nthe second article is way better because\nhe really explains um exactly how and\nhow many iterations he went because he\ncreate original vibe coder and then he\ncreated VC and then he created a Python\nversion of Gastown. He had a couple of\nworkshops.\nUh I think it's the second one there.\nYeah. And then he did the Golang version\nof Gaston and he he kind of explains his\nexperiences using Python versus Golang\nand um you know what worked, what didn't\nwork and like he went to through three\nor four iterations of um Gaston.\nSo\nit's a very good I like this one. It's a\nway more gentler introduction to how it\ncame to be what it is. Um but it is a\nvery interesting way and is a very\ninteresting\nyou know group of people are approaching\nagent orchestration by building it in a\nnon-engineering\nway. For example, is it better to create\ngit work trees and let every agent work\nin an isolated work like git branch and\nthen deal with the branch conflicts like\nmerge conflicts or and that's another\napproach. Is it better to all let them\nall like let's say you're in three or\nfour agents at the same time on the same\nfile system and give them a way to\ncommunicate with each other and reserve\nfiles so that they don't create these\nconflicts at in the first place. And as\nan engineer,\n>> yeah, blocking a folder or something.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. So, as an engineer, you come with\na long background of like git and\nversioning and collaboration that takes\nseveral days and you know this type of\nworkflow, whereas these agents work at a\nvery different like speed and have a\nmuch better way of coordinating than us.\nSo, approaching it from a non-engineer\nperspective, which is what um this guy,\nI forgot his name now on Twitter. He\nbuilt the the mail system that Gasttown\nuses. So basically this male MCP for\nagents to communicate is all coming from\nnon-engineers looking at this O AI um\nhype from a completely different angle\nlike a non-engineering angle and I\nthought that was very interesting to\nread and I think Ralph Wigum is also an\napproach to that right stop trying to\nbuild too many processes around these\nagents and give them a very simple loop.\nSo have you have you tried it? Actually\nI can relax now since um the school is\nnot opening in is delayed opening for 1\nhour.\n>> Oh because people were stuck.\n>> We got time.\nSo that's good.\nSo yeah. Have you have you tried well\nthis uh approach then?\nNo, but I think the the one of the\nbreakdowns for it I thought was very\ninteresting breakdown because I think I\njust I'm repeating myself. Sorry, I'm\ndistracted. Because it identifies that\nthe models have just become so much\nbetter. And also I feel that kind of\nreflects us as we are like you know this\ndidn't work but I finally found\nsomething that worked and and and this\nworks 100%. I tried so many and it\ndidn't work but guess what?\n>> Maybe it doesn't work because you found\nthe right way of doing it. Maybe it just\nworks so much better.\n>> Personally, personally, I I thought AI\nwas was was interesting, but then when\nClaude 4.5 came along, I thought to\nmyself, \"Holy moly.\" Yeah. So many\npeople now because I I avoided X for a\nlong time and but it used to be a very\ngood source of news, but you were\nsharing me some threads and then I\ndecided to just start going through this\nand and the\n>> onex you mean.\n>> Yeah. If you subscribe, if you follow\nthe right people, then it's insane. Like\nthe amount of\n>> Yeah, that that tab is insane. But if\nyou\n>> and the amount of people going like I\njust spent two weeks during the holidays\nwith Opus with the double limits and I'm\nsold. I'm sold. That's it.\n>> I'm sold. I I I I enjoyed uh the\nanthropic posts on on X like the the the\nuh advent calendar and the that Boris\nguy is also really good that the the the\nwhat's his name?\nGod searching on uh the guy that that\ninvented Corker or\nhe he's great. Yeah. is I don't know if\nyou follow him, but he's he's posting\n>> Boris. Yeah, because he people ask\nthings and he he replies to them and he\ntalks about his his his workflow,\n>> but then he also replies, \"Oh, just do\nthis.\" Or he says, \"Yeah, that's a great\nidea. Let me let me add that and we'll\nadd it to the backlog.\"\n>> Yeah. Yeah. There was an epic one where\nsomeone suggested something and then he\nreleased it in 20 minutes.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> and also that he says that he's what\nmerging 100 PRs and he has like\n>> six um parallel agents and the way he\nswitches between his mobile and his his\n>> I I I have I'm using my wife's\nsubscription\nbecause I have API subscription through\nwork and I just don't want to mix it all\nup. So the the the the thing that\nconfuses me or the thing that I want to\ndo, the workflow that I want to do is\nthat like I I have my clawed stuff or I\nhave my agents doing something, but say\nI pop out to go fetch my kids and or I'm\nin the supermarket. It would be nice to\nto go on the Claude app and basically\nsee how those agents are doing, but but\nright now there's no link between Claude\ncode u sessions and and the and the app.\nAnd I thought he was alluding to the\nfact that that this might be possible\nbecause he said, you know, there's a\ncommand in the cloud co\nand uh but it but it doesn't actually do\nanything.\n>> Yeah. There was another very cool one.\nUm, people are more and more saying like\nI need my laptop like my cloud code on\nmy laptop because it has everything\ninstalled. And Boris, I don't know how\nhe does it, but he must I don't know\nmaybe he has a custom sandbox internally\nwithin Antropic that has all the tools\nthat has more than what we get when\nwe're on the web. But\n>> we get like if you use cloud code on the\nweb, there's a lot of restrictions on it\nobviously because they don't want people\nto start running crypto miners.\nAnd so basically he um somebody says\nwhat if I can just like run a T-max um\nfrom my laptop or like a reverse tunnel,\nyou know, like Angro and have that\nexposed through the web so that I can\njust be on my mobile.\n>> This this might help you. Bars, help me.\nI hit my weekly limit slash extra usage.\nYeah. You know what that is?\n>> It just starts using your it starts\nusing your wallet with the API costs.\n>> So like you you use you pay $20 a month.\nYou put $5 or maybe you put $20 in your\nwallet. You you hit the five hour\nsession limit and you go like, you know\nwhat, I would really love Opus to finish\nthis. And you like go like, yes, extra\nusage. And it burns through $20 within\nlike within like an hour. And you go\nlike, what? I just paid $20 a month and\nnow I just burn to another 20 in an\nhour. It's very very painful, but it\ndoes help if you're in a rush.\n>> This is also interesting. Opus 4.5 is\nRalph Wigum and Playright is AGI.\n>> I disagree. Those are people I talked to\none guy and he has like an enterprise\naccess and he says, \"Yeah, I I I burn\nmillions of tokens like like you\nmentioned before. They have thousands of\ndollars.\" Then maybe you can you can use\nPlayright MCP. But if you're on a a\nnormal subscription,\n>> so the last podcast upload.\n>> Yeah.\n>> If um and you can find it on debase.com\npodcast,\n>> the thought that's been jiggling around\nmy mind since we last spoke is is valid.\n>> How do you test and validate stuff?\n>> Yep.\n>> Do you have do you have the solution for\nthat? Because Yeah. Like when I read\nthis um this tweet about\n>> about playright being the agi you were\nsaying to me no you're running play\nright wrong with MCP so so how do you\nrun play right right play right right\nshould be a rapper okay so what is my\nproblem with MCPS and also the problem\nthat both Cloudflare and Antropic have\nhighlighted is that it's a massive token\nwaste that sending all of the characters\nacross on every turn one by one I've hit\nit myself several times. It's very\nfrustrating.\n>> Right. So when you use the playright\nMCP, it will take screenshots which is B\n64 encoded image. So that's the\nsignificant amount of characters. It\nwill take a structural document like\nsome type of YAML representation or an\nXML representation of the whole page.\nIt's not really XML because it's like\nmore of a structure of all of the\nelements. Um it's a it's a strange I\ndon't know this representation. I'm not\na front end engineer, you know, but but\nit takes it some type of of skeleton,\nnot a screenshot, but sometimes of like\nstructure, it also sends that down to\nthe model. Um, and and all of this\ninformation is like so much. But when\nyou use playwright as a as a scripting\nengine, basically you write you write a\nscript, right? you say first go to this\nURL\n>> then click on the login page\n>> then you will be redirected\nautomatically to another page wait for\nthe um username text box to be available\nor element to be available\n>> I have scripts like that myself\n>> but that's a script that is a maybe you\nknow 20 lines and that gets generated by\nthe LLM and sent to playright and it\nexecutes in one go and it may get the\nreading that script\nwastes a ton of tokens in my experience.\n>> Oh, it doesn't. Why would it? What? It\nliterally didn't not I I never wrote\nplayright in my life and I was like I\nwould love to be able to do more of an\nend to end. So maybe I share my screen.\nI don't have\n>> Okay.\n>> Uh\n>> Okay.\nYeah, you got to you got to demonstrate\nthis workflow. I'm very curious. Like\nfor example, could you could you show a\nworkflow where um\n>> not on requests? I can show you what I\nhave.\n>> Okay.\n>> No, but I want to see how you create it.\nLike go to like debase.com\n>> and also\n>> listen to a podcast or something. I mean\nthat's very simple. There's no login\nhere or anything.\n>> Validate that there's a\n>> send me that in advance and I will try\n>> Kim.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Thank you. Thank you uh Abiooft for\ncreating Kalema. I mean I'd be dead if I\ndidn't I mean Mac OS would so suck if it\ndidn't add Kalema. Yeah. All the other\nones you need to pay, right?\n>> Exactly.\n>> Yeah. So, I have like test users, Alice\nuser, platform user, new user with no\ngroups and and I'm validating that these\nusers are not able, you know, to do\nthings. So, it has like\n>> you coded this with the AI, right?\n>> Yeah. I I don't know how to write any of\nthis. I have not written a single letter\nof code in this test.\n>> Okay. Okay. So, so it's 170 lines.\n>> Okay.\n>> Right.\n>> Um\nthe the setup thing\nis the coolest thing because it does the\nE2E setup which um as you can see it\nmakes sure that the containers are\nrunning and then it makes sure that the\nusers like it creates a user by creating\nthe Alice user inside um inside click\nand and creates the test user with\ncertain password\nand and and everything. It also goes\nagainst my API to register the user\nrole. So if if I in kick look I create a\nuser a certain group membership and in\nmy API I create group membership to role\nmapping. So it does both ends. Okay.\nRight. So this playright test. So that's\nlike a UI for running the script.\n>> Yes. So and this is this is gold and uh\nbecause if I\n>> it's amazing I tell you. So once\neverything's up right now the server is\nup and they're listening.\n>> Yeah. and and I can just go for example\nI want to do a successful login and\nsuccession persistence test. So I'm\ngoing to log in and then I'm going to\nrefresh and make sure I'm still logged\nin. Right? So I close the console. The\nthere's nothing here. It did not run.\nWhen I click it and when you trigger\nthem it's going to run them all in\nparallel. This is running in a separate\nChrome browser. So in this case it goes\nto sign in with SSO\nbut clearly it's it failed. Oh no it\ndidn't fail. It didn't fail. Sorry it\npassed. It's green, right? There's some\nerror messages here. 401 unauthorized.\nThat's my API because my web asks um\nlike the login status and you get a 401\nif you're not logged in. So these\nconsole error messages I have to get rid\nof at some point. That's my who am I\nendpoint. Anyway, you can see here it\nran very fast, right? It took 3 seconds.\nSo it navigated.\n>> So what ran in parallel? I didn't quite\nunderstand.\n>> I just ran one. I just ran this one.\n>> But if you run them, you can if I click\nthis one, it's going to run all of\nthese. You can click this one. It's\ngoing to run all of them. And it's going\nto all run in separate headless uh not\nheadless, it's going to run all in\nChrome uh instances separated\nindividually. All run at the same time.\nAll different workers, Chrome workers.\nSo So I just ran one. So it went to the\nwebsite and then it says not\nauthenticated. It clicked on sign in. It\nwas redirected to Keycloak. It entered\nthe test user which was part of the\nbootstrap. It clicked on login. Yeah.\n>> Then it went it was automatically\nredirected to the to the API and it\nwaited for the selector. So this is\nsomething that that you learn.\nOriginally the the LLM did not generate\nany test ID onto the elements inside the\nbrowser. So it look for text like it\nlooks for like the login button and\nthings like that.\n>> But if you then after a while I think\nopen code C codeex or Gemini said you\nknow what would make it really easy if\nyou would add test ID to each of these\nelements. I was like what what is test\nID? I was like, well, you know, if you\nwant to do playright scripts, you just\nadd like little attributes to each of\nthese elements and then\n>> it just it just came up with that in a\ncoding session.\n>> Yeah, I have no idea. Like, again, I\nhave never written playright in my life.\nI have not done this. I'm not a front-\nend engineer. And it just said, let's\nuse a test ID. I was like, okay,\nawesome. Do it.\n>> And so, it waits for the selector\n>> and then it's it\nreloads to make sure that the user is\nstill logged in, right? And then it\nverifies I expect to still be logged in.\nAnd then I guess it opens this uh login\nscreen on the right and it sees I'm\nlogged in and I have a product engineer\nrole because I'm a product engineer\ngroup membership. Right? But what if I\nwant to you know what if I introduce\nfailure, right? So again this did not\ninvolve right now I ran my own make\ntarget but this did not involve any you\nknow back and forth between the LLM and\nthe MCP server directing Chrome anything\nlike that right it was a single script\nand it ran the full thing end to end and\nthen it gets the result it gets the\nconsole it gets the errors at every\nstage you can see exactly what was the\nstate of the web browser at that point\num so if I if I close this then the make\ntarget will finish.\nSo now if I um go and change something\nfor example in my outflow or maybe in my\npage maybe in my web app I will I will\nremove the test ID for example so it\ncan't find the element. So let's go\nunder\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I like this idea testing for\nfailure.\n>> Yeah.\nNo login pace. Is there like test ID?\n>> No. Where is the test ID even? you know\nyour code base inside out.\n>> I haven't touched this. I haven't I\nhaven't touched this for um\nfor like\never. I don't know.\n>> This is when you when you start whipping\nout copilot, please make a failing test.\n>> Yeah, there's some here like it tries to\nit tries to make sure that the edges\nexist between states. And here is the\nlist view. It tries to make sure that a\ncertain um state ID is listed after you\nthis is part of the create. So there's\none test that does that does a create\ncreates a state but my my dashboard is\nsupposed to be read only but I wanted to\ntest permissions so I added the create\nstate button.\nIt's like oh my god I have to remove\nthat. Um even for the notification it\ntries to make sure that there's an error\nmessage. So maybe if I remove the toast\ntest ID, let's say I remove this and\nthen I find the test that looks for\nnotification toast. So let's find that.\n>> Um, it's definitely not in the TSX. It's\ngoing to be in the test scripts, I\nthink.\n>> I think you your\ndidn't work.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, by the way, did you try a marachi?\nYeah, I am using a much I'm using Arch\nby the way, but not here.\n>> But but you but did you try a March?\n>> Yeah, I'm using of course I'm not going\nto use Arch without a March. What kind\nof lunatic do you think I am?\n>> Well, but like I installed it the ISO\nyesterday. I was very impressed.\n>> Yeah,\n>> I've got it on my on my uh my ThinkPad.\n>> Just don't run the like screen saver\nbecause it crashed constantly and it\nkills Hyperland. Okay. So, you're using\nOmari,\nof course.\n>> Yeah. So, there's this thing checks for\na success notification. So, there's some\nuh here verify state created looks for a\nsuccess notification which looks for uh\nlocates ro alert. No, that's not what I\nwant. I want to know the one that has\nlike\ntoast notification. So, it added the\ntest IDs, but it's not using them.\nNice. Uh,\n>> yeah. So,\n>> I'm sure it's using it. So, here it's\nusing them here. Let's look for those.\nIt used for out profile button. So, let\nme remove the out profile button. So,\nlet me let me remove the test ID. So, it\ncan't find that anymore. And then it\nwill fail the test because it's not\nthere. Right. Let's look for\n>> call it button two or something. I don't\nknow why you want to do this.\n>> Yeah. So what I wanted to get out of\nthis conversation is that I wanted to\nknow that there's some a good way of\ntesting\nuh an AI generated product and making\nsure that it's consistent and doesn't\nbreak for users and things like that.\nOkay, let's run it again. The So this\nhelper is the\nthis is the login via keycloak. So it's\ngoing to fail the login via K clock\nbecause I I removed it. So the first\nthing one that we did should fail this\ntime and we should get like a clear\nerror message of why it failed\n>> and where and where where in the code\n>> and you get an LLM prompt also from from\nplayright\n>> which is the craziest part.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Huh? What\n>> you get an LLM prompt. It's going to say\nit failed on this step. Here's your LLM\nprompt to find it. Find the fix.\n>> Is this part of playright already? This\nis part of play, right?\n>> This is why I'm like whoever like I try\nto find online resources. Every single\none is about the MCP. I'm like why is\nnobody talking about this this awesome\nfeatures that are in in playright that\nare like way better than the stupid MCP.\nSo okay, let's close the console again.\n>> Yeah, the\n>> this one should fail now. It should\n>> a lot of people have gone off the ball\nwith MCP.\n>> Yeah, expect to be visit. Wait, wait,\nwait.\nIt's probably going to time out, right?\n>> Kaboom.\n>> May maybe I need to build my web app\nagain. No, it failed. It errors, right?\n>> Yeah,\n>> it failed here.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Here it says expect locator to be\nvisible failed.\n>> Yeah,\n>> it says locator here and then copy\nprompt.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> And you go into your code and you go\ninto cloud and you say, \"Hey, um, well,\ndon't use this prompt because it's going\nto\n>> That's the biggest prompt I've ever seen\nin my life. It's like 20 pages. How many\nlines of code is that?\"\n>> But it's everything that you would It's\nIt's a lot shorter.\n>> Just scroll just scroll down. Like, how\nhow long is this thing? Just scroll\ndown.\n>> Keep your knickers on.\n>> They're on. Trust me.\n>> 300 lines. Not that much. Come on.\n>> What the hell? That's but that's\namazing. But at the same time,\n>> it's absolutely amazing because it goes\nlike look this is what the page is.\nHere's the YAML. This is the page\nsnapshot. The thing I told you it has\nthis this YAML representation of the\npage. And if I give this if I just give\nthis right now\n>> HTML\n>> it 100% cloud will go like yo the the\nloc the location button has a two to it.\nIt changed for sure. It will find it in\na sec in an instant.\nNot even going to I'm not giving it\npermission to write. I'm just going to\nlaunch cloud real fast.\nPaste that in.\n>> Probably going to waste $10 on this on\nthis uh\n>> now. I haven't used cloud all day. It's\nfine.\nUse 77% of the commitment.\n>> It's fine. It resets um on the Thursday.\nYeah, it's still enough. 25% for\nWednesday should be enough. One day more\nthan enough.\nOkay, look. It didn't even have to go\nthrough anything like the test expect\nthe element to be like this. But your\nprofile button\num would you like me to read? Yes, read\nit. Let's read. It didn't read. It just\nsaid uh it fails because the it looking\nfor this button. It can't find this\nbutton. So, it hasn't even read the odd\nstate yet, but immediately it's going to\nsay, \"Oh, you have a the test ID\nchange.\"\n>> Okay. Well, I\n>> There you go. It says like there there's\nyour problem. The test ID doesn't match.\n>> Okay. Very good demo. Very good demo.\nVincent,\n>> not not prepared at all. But but but now\ndo you trust me? Because earlier you\nwere like you you did not trust me. You\neven wanted to hang up the\n>> I still think the the creating the these\ntests is is damn expensive. But\num like I'm just thinking like like\nlegacy applications where\n>> that's what I was telling you. I was\ntelling you that none of the\napplications that we've written so far\nhave these things in place. But if you\nif you one thing is with LLMs you can\nactually spend you say it's expensive\nbut how much do you pay for a QA\nengineer? $5,000 a month. How much do\nyou pay for cloud? I pay 30 $30 a month\nand it did all of this for me.\n>> But it's it's also Yeah. I mean\n>> you're right. You're right.\n>> You're right. You're right. You're\nright. It's I actually never thought\nabout the the poor QA engineer who's\ngoing to be threatened by AI. But now\nI'm thinking\n>> but the QA engineer would have saved me\nmoney because I wouldn't have written\nall of the tests without test IDs. It\nwould have immediately thought like hey\nwe need playright we need test IDs. Stop\nthis right.\n>> Well\n>> well I no I'm just thinking aloud that\nthere's no need for a test engine.\nI mean that that job is\n>> now you need to be all right. You need\nto pick it up quickly and you can learn\nquickly from the LLM.\n>> You need to know workflows like you the\none you just showed me. So hopefully\n>> which is why I think\n>> the podcast viewers will will rate the\npodcast or or like it to say that hey I\nlearned something thanks to Vincent's\ndemo right now\n>> which Kai didn't trust. Never going to\nmake that mistake.\n>> A healthy skeptic skepticism.\nOkay. So that that approach shows me\nthat you tested it with playright,\nbut I just c can we have a quick look at\nbeads because that that confuses the\nhell out of\n>> Yeah, go ahead because you had a lot of\nquestions about beats. You took already\nthis screen I guess.\n>> Um no I haven't actually\nscreen\n>> but can you now understand that all of\nthis material maybe it should be the\nfirst dabbase.com blog going about stop\nusing playride mcp and use playrite the\nright way. Why don't why don't you write\na blog? Jesus Christ. It's still\nI need you to I need you to help me out\nhere. I'm dying.\n>> I don't know because Oh, blog on the\nbase or blog. I don't really have you\nhave\n>> you can you can blog on the base. It's\njust do a pull request.\n>> Ah, guest blogs.\n>> Okay. So, here we I'm I'm sharing the\nscreen now. Hopefully, everyone can see\nmy screen. This is beads, baby. Okay.\nOne thing that confuses me is that when\nyou look at the workflow runs, they all\nfail.\nSo that makes me think like, well, what\nhow come they're even failing? Because,\nyou know, they're using AI.\n>> Check the CI. The only way to make sure\nif something is properly tested looking\nat the CI.\n>> Okay. It looks like it's the Golint is\nis failing. But but still,\n>> can you see my screen?\nYeah, probably. I just can't see you. I\ndon't know where you are.\n>> Uhhuh. Whatever. So, I mean, it's a bit\ntrivial here. Like, it's a golden error,\nbut like why didn't like the hook or\nsomething pick that up?\n>> It's been failing for ages. Um, so that\nthat's that's my first question about\nbeads.\n>> No, hold on a minute. I think I Oh, now\nI can see it. Okay,\n>> the next the next thing. Okay, like say\nso say this is release 0.440.\nOkay. So, we should be able to see uh\n>> Oh, you're right. All of the all of the\nG actions are failing.\n>> Yeah,\n>> that's ridiculous.\n>> Yeah. So, like how does he even release\nit when everything's failing? So, it\njust shows me that\n>> that's why I haven't updated for a\nwhile.\n>> But like I mean\n>> that's the question.\n>> Okay. Now, let's have a look at this.\nLike if I go, it's clone it out. You can\nsee my screen, right?\n>> Yes. So, if you go if you go into beads,\nso get tag. Oh my god, this is probably\ngoing to show you how how incompetent I\nam. Where's the latest bloody tag? Okay,\nso this So, if I go get uh switch, I\nthink that should work, shouldn't it?\nUh,\n>> don't\nget check out on the tag directly. Yes.\n>> Um, I think I need to still create a\nbranch, don't I? uh release.\nOkay, so this is 04440\nand I think if if you run scripts tests,\nit should pass, right?\nWell, if the CI is failing,\nthen I would not expect it to pass on a\nmachine that doesn't have any special\nsetup.\n>> To me, the CI is the validation that\n>> you need to say to anyone like\n>> it's a you problem because it works on\nthe machine. So, it's your machine\nproblem. If the if the CI is not\nworking, I cannot say anything.\n>> Yeah. So I I ran I ran scripts test\nessential on a on a main checkout and it\nfailed and I was like what how can this\npossibly be basically so yeah here here\nlook it's failing\n>> in get in in go test it's failing in the\nCI yet he makes a release\nI'm I'm totally confused\ninteresting very interesting\nSteve,\n>> very worrying.\n>> Steve, what the hell are you doing, man?\n>> Wait, he's watches. All of this. All of\nthis.\n>> He what? Of course he watches.\n>> Hey, Steve.\n>> Hey, Boris.\n>> Thanks for tuning in, man.\n>> Hey, Slam, man.\n>> Can we go to the Ralph Wigan memes?\n>> Yeah, let's let's go to the Ralph Wigan\nmemes.\n>> I don't Are you familiar with um with\nInvincible?\nSo the cartoon characters there is in is\nthe Vuvian\nof in\n>> this is a Marvel thing, isn't it?\n>> No, like it's it's like this\nanti-heroes.\nSo, and that's a spoiler for season for\nmaybe the first three episodes of season\none, but\n>> Oh, no. I'm not going to watch this\ncrap.\n>> Yeah. So, so it's a lot of these heroes\ncomic books, they're now like the heroes\nare actually super villains.\n>> Um, like the boys and and Jenv and and\nand Invincible, but but it's pretty\nfunny because\n>> he is this super it's like a play on\nSuperman, but he comes from like\nKrypton,\nplanet Krypton. Um, so he's like a\nSuperman inside Earth and he's they're\nlooking at um airplanes that are flying\nand he's he's telling his son, but he he\nbasically his role is to prepare Earth\nfor takeover. So he's supposed to\ndestroy all of the Earth defenses. Yeah.\n>> So um but his son um is supposed to, you\nknow, follow in his footsteps but\nrefuses. And so he's telling him like,\n\"Look at what they need to mimic a\nfraction of our power because they need\nall of these machines to fly and all,\nbut we we have so much more power.\" And\nand so basically here the GPT 5.2 users\nare making fun of it because I think\nit's very funny a very funny meme\nbecause when you use cloud code, it goes\nvery fast but it makes mistakes, right?\nSo you put it in a loop but if you use\ncodeex or GPD 5.2 two, it goes very\nslow, but it ends up being correct\nbecause it like spends a lot of time\nactually reasoning and making changes.\nIt kind of has the loop built in and and\nand that's kind of a\n>> joke. So, GPT 5.2 already has this kind\nof flow\n>> because, you know, it's so much slower\nand people are like, I hate GPT5 because\nit's so slow. It's not feel doesn't feel\nsnappy. But then on the other side, you\nhave all these cloud users that are so\nsnappy having to put it into a stupid\nloop. Yeah, that's a typical trade-off\nbetween\nspeed and uh\nand uh quality, I suppose. If it's fast\nenough, it doesn't really matter, does\nit? Or\n>> it can pave over the cracks quickly or\nsomething. I\n>> I don't know. It depends on the\ncomplexity of the task, you know, and\nbecause we're so bad at selecting the\nthe models ourselves or the automatic\nselecting doesn't really work well. I'm\nhappy to have a model that is very\nsnappy for most of the things that I\nneed it to do and then when it needs to\ndo a super hard troubleshooting thing\nthat I need to let it loop a bit I'm\nalso okay with it or maybe I just switch\nover myself but I would rather have\nsomething that's always fast than\nsomething like GPT5.\nYeah, I thought it was a funny a funny u\nyou know reference.\n>> Open code became the default on Omari\n>> default\n>> the default. So, Omari ships with CH GPT\nand cloud code and they switched u as a\ndefault CLI agent to open code. So, they\nuse Ghosti already by default and now\nthey made open I mean they just added\nthe package as far as I could tell. But\nyeah, yeah, I'm I'm so impressed with\nOmari. Um\nI'm really impressed.\n>> But the the greatest thing about it is\nOmari DHH is very much focused on um the\nthe theming, right? He he forked\nchromium so just that he could apply the\ntheme\n>> color. I think the theming is a way of\nhook of attracting people. I mean I\nthink I think I think DHH is is next\nlevel. I think he has a very good sense\nof taste. You need that that that polish\nthat that the Linux desktop has been\nmissing. and Amachi with the themes. I I\nknow for for power users it's it's a bit\nof a waste of space, but like I I\nunderstand why he's gone gone that way.\nI I mean the whole the whole install\nprocess. Did you run through this\ninstall process too?\n>> Yeah, just like you have the same\npictures and I posted on Instagram, not\non Twitter.\n>> It's just it's just amazing like like\nwhen you install Windows, it takes you\nlike half a day. This took like this\ntakes three minutes.\n>> He does it on on stage, right? Uh here I\nhad the whole actually when uh let me\nturn off the the\n>> It's so amazing. I If you're not using\nAmarachi, why aren't you using Amarachi?\nIt's amazing.\n>> Yeah.\n>> The the coolest thing is that\n>> he he he's also even solved copy and\npaste. Like copy and paste works really\nwell. The super\n>> So I was like asking CHPT. This was like\nwhen it was booting. Oh yeah, it has the\nwhole uh it's a video basically. What?\n>> Oh my god. This you this. Please stop\nthese handheld videos.\n>> How are you going to make a screen uh\ncapture when it's booting?\n>> Well, you you can get one of these.\n>> You are you have Why did you take a\npicture with your lap phone of your of\nyour\n>> True, but it's at least it's better.\nIt's It's less irritating than a video.\n>> And this one. Stop. I sent you one and\nnow I show you a second.\n>> No. What was your installed? What was\nyour time?\nWhat was your time?\n>> Can you show the time? Uh, 6 minutes and\n20 seconds.\n>> Oh my god, what a loser.\n>> I How come it mine was so slow? It's a\nVietnam internet, dude. I'm not on a\nbackbone. What kind of internet\nconnection do you have?\n>> What? A gigabit?\n>> Yeah. The fact that you have like a IP\nrange tells me you probably pay a\nshitload of money for a backbone\ninternet connection straight a pipe\nstraight to your bedroom.\n>> Yeah. I don't know if you do anything\nlike this, but like what I like to do is\nis I I smoke ping my internet connection\nto like for example S3 endpoints so I\nknow exactly if my S3 endpoint is is uh\nsucking or doing something weird.\n>> Okay. So it's definitely internet\nproblems for me because\n>> Yeah. I mean\n>> because it was you choose to live in a\nthird world country.\n>> Oh, you also did it on a new NVME SSD\nthat you bought, right?\n>> Huh? You als we also just at the same\ntime bought\n>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I installed it on a new\nThis is the same I Well, you Okay. You\nhave this You have the high-end Samsung\none that cost\n>> and it still took 6 minutes and your\nshitty end one it took three minutes.\n>> Well, I got the micron the micron.\nUm yeah, like I'm just quite bullish\nabout Omari and uh the future the I feel\nlike the tiling has been pretty amazing\nmanager,\n>> huh?\n>> The tiling window manager takes a while\nto get used to though.\n>> I mean to be honest, I'm I'm a full\nscreen kind of guy. I I mean I I have my\nmy workspaces 1 2 3 4 5.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean I've been I've been using DWM for\na decade or something and it's basically\nthe same idea. Okay.\n>> But you have one screen of two screens.\n>> Well, I have like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.\n>> No, I mean on your lap. So, it's a\nlaptop with one. I have like\n>> two screens. So, for me, it took a while\nto get used to like moving the window.\n>> But, but you're on your Mac OS machine\nright now, aren't you?\n>> Yeah. Yeah, I'm on the Mac OS, but I\ninstalled it on my desktop with like\ndual monitors. On my MacBook, I have\nthree I have my MacBook plus two\nscreens.\n>> Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I'm I'm\nstill loving my M1 Mac Pro. I don't see\nmyself changing but but my but my backup\nmachine is a Marchi so I'm I'm pretty\npleased with that okay when I like I've\nworked at a few startups like okay let\nlike sometimes like okay let I'm I'm\nbeing very facitious here but like like\nfor example I'm working at go back in\nthe day and they're product owners that\nget assigned to a product and and like\nI'm just thinking to myself like what\nare their qualifications\nlike how did this person become a\nproduct owner owner. This person doesn't\nknow how to code or is not very very\nspecifically but but somehow they're in\ncharge of this uh this product to do\nthis thing and I'm like\n>> I think product owners\nit seems like like an MBA middle manager\nand that's that was the qualification\n>> but surely an MBA middle manager product\nowner is not going to fly today.\n>> Yeah. But I I known product owners that\nare very good and and you know they're\nfocused on user stories and focused also\non deliverables and um they do you know\nwith together with UX and the graphic\ndesign designers and there's that's a\ncomplex job but definitely that's where\nI'm also like when I'm doing my full\nstack stuff for fun I'm like yeah I'm\nobviously not a UX expert and I'm scared\nlike I need to get those thing under\nunder control because I need I feel like\nI can direct\n>> the typical product owner doesn't isn't\na UI expert either right\n>> the so and a colleague uh some time back\ntold me that to be a middle manager\nanyone can be he told me like anyone\ncould be a middle manager all you need\nto be is organized\nis it correct to say that um AI helps\nyou keep organized this Cuz that's the\nway I think about it.\n>> I think you need to I think when when\nyou use AI, you need to be even more\norganized because AI goes on the tangent\nwith you if you don't pay attention.\n>> I see.\n>> I think you need to really know like\nhold on a minute. This is high priority.\nYes. Yes. AI can tell you this high\npriority, but it's only going off on\nwhat you make it feel like. If you feel\nthat is not a high priority, you will,\nyou know, AI will quickly adjust and go,\nyou're absolutely right.\n>> Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're\nright. You It's I guess this goes back\nto people who have experience. The\npeople the people that have a taste or\nor know the the different rabbit holes\nthat you can run into, the people that\nknow how to get to a deliverable are\nbetter disposed to work with AI.\n>> I think so. Yeah. people that are able\nto keep the goal their eyes on the on\nthe target and and scope down and\nidentify this is good for an MVP. I need\nto get this in front of users quickly\nand and able to\n>> I guess I was trying to paint a picture\nthat that us engineers would be a better\nfit for the product owner. We were\nhoping for it but I'm not sure given the\nexamples I gave you earlier as well like\nan engineer exposes explores these this\nworking like collaborative working of\nengine of agents using git and what he\nknows but somebody coming like from a\ncompletely different background just\nthings like well we're orchestrating\nthings that communicate at the lightning\nspeed it's not like humans need to wait\nfor each other and are busy and are\nsleeping you know they can easily\ncoordinate file system and and you know\ntweet a few turns and\n>> yeah, but a product a product owner is\nnot going to come up with that Ralph\nWigum approach is is he he or she\nwell\n>> well apparently it was product owners\nand it was a dude that is a a quant\ntrainer uh you know high frequency\ntrader\n>> that that came up with these systems. I\nguess I'm biased to think how engineers\nare going to scale up, but I'm also\n>> Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to figure\nout in my brain is like I think I think\nI know where I need to go, but but where\ndo the existing people need to go too\nalso? Like I I guess all these skills\nthat we're learning are accessible to\nanyone really. Yeah, it's just a matter\nof who is passive to reinvent themsel\nand who can, you know, because this is\none thread I saw on on on Twitter now. I\nused to say always say I saw it on\nReddit. Now I start to say I saw it on\nTwitter. Um which is like\n>> some people they're just doing their 9\nto5. They have their family life. They\nhave no time to explore this. And then\nyou have other people\n>> that have nothing but time. Maybe\nthey're unemployed or they're just like\nSteve addicted to to these things and\nthey're just uh you know Steve Jay was\nsaying I'm running cloud code while I'm\ndriving like it's it's on my laptop in\nmy car and and like I'm on it all the\ntime and um\n>> yeah people investing their time. Yeah,\nI guess it's all about that people\ninvesting time.\n>> He said I had 1 million and this is\nanother thing they say right? You need\nto get in the reps. you need to be like\nyou need to exercise and it becomes a\nbody to to muscle like mind to body uh\nconnection but when you're on the topic\nbecause everyone is going off uh and\nmisrepresenting this tweet from this\nGoogle engineer principal engineer at\nGoogle uh Jana Doan or Rakil who build\n>> Yeah Raquel yeah yeah I I love that lady\nshe's written some great stuff\n>> load testers and stuff in\n>> yeah it's one of my favorite tools\n>> yeah I also use it so she said that they\nspent several years as a team\num building.\n>> Oh, do you have the tweet?\n>> Did she still have it on her account?\nShe might have removed it cuz I think\nmany people just jumped on it and said\nlike you see AGI is here because\num you know Cloud Code was able to do it\nin a week what they spent years to do.\nYeah, this is that's the one, right? I'm\nnot joking and this isn't funny.\n>> Yeah, I I I hate it.\nThis person screenshotted her like what\nis that because she removed it?\n>> I think she might. Well, the my my\ntakeaway of what she said was that was\nthat uh was that well Claude was is good\na and b uh that like\nthat that Claude was was able to make a\nbreakthrough because like let's be\nhonest like when you have a team when\nyou have a team of like three or let's\nsay five let's say if you have a team of\nfive actually good people\n>> it's it's quite a struggle to build\nsomething because the five people might\nbe pulling in different directions. But\nwhen you but when you give a task like\nbuild an orchestrator to to claude 5 4.5\nand then out pops a a product and you\nknow 10 minutes later you're like\nwondering what the hell's going on now.\n>> This is like a classic case of Captain\nHindsight like you know\n>> Captain Hindsight.\n>> You know Captain Hindsight from South\nPark?\n>> No. No I don't actually.\nHe comes to a burning building and\npeople are screaming and they're like,\n\"Save us, Captain Hindsight.\" And say,\n\"That building is built too close to the\nother building and there should be a\nfire exit there. You're welcome.\" And he\ngoes away. Like\nanyway, um it's like they spent years\ndesigning this and iterating through\ndifferent versions. and she approached\ncloud and you prompted it just an\nindicator that an expert with experience\ninto certain systems and knowing the\ntrade-offs is able to build something\nlike within 5 days with it, but it\ndoesn't represent all of the, you know,\nmistakes that they made along the way\nand all of the retries they had to do\nand the different iterations that went\nthrough.\n>> So, it would have taken a lot longer.\nBut reality is yes. I mean you can you\ncan definitely take an idea and iterate\nand and then or build an MVP and try it\nout and then realize all the problems\nthat you have with it and then quickly\nthrow it away and and and step back and\ndo another one. Uh which is what what\nSteve Jie said when he was building\nGastown, right? He did the Python\nversion then did the Golang version and\nand he says like he basically spun it up\nlooked at the agents what they were\ntrying to do and then because he has\nthis idea like we talked about last time\nyou you built the the flags and the\ncommands that the agents are trying like\nthey hey here's beats issue tracker\ncreate an issue and it goes like okay bd\ncreate and in an error it's create d-\ndescription oh the description should be\na positional argument instead of a flag\nyou know so he makes the the tool to\nbehave like like the agents and then\nwhen he was building gas town he tries\nit. The agents are like struggling. He\nhe kills it. He just looks at what they\ndid and then he builds those flags and\nthose commands. They said it took like\nthree four iterations and finally the\nagents were like intuitively picking\neverything up and started to just turn\ncode out on their own. That's when I\nknew I had it. That's when I knew it was\nready to go. And since then it's been\nrunning and he has like received 30\ndifferent uh pull requests and like it's\nbarely four days and he says it's taken\ntaking off like crazy. This thing is\ngoing on its own. And another really\ncool uh observation he made was that\nbeats was launched in October. It wasn't\npart of the training corpus of LLMs. Yet\nthey were very good at using it. But\nwhat else is happening is all of these\nLLMs get retrained with the new updated\ndata and they will be intuitive on\nbeats. They will be trained on beats.\n>> They will know how to use it and they\nwill know how to use Gasttown. So it's\nonly going to get better. they're only\ngoing to get more intuitive with Gaston\nis what he said. And I thought that was\na really cool um takeaway as well. It's\nbasically, you know, the what they call\nit pointing.\n>> That's one thing that I found quite\nfrustrating with the skills because I\nwrote a skill to help me like\nI wrote a skill to help me um to use uh\nthe GitHub CLI for example, right? Like\nthis one here. Like if I give you this\nURL then you can view it and you can for\nsome reason that I need to put the ch\noverride the GH pager otherwise when you\nwhen you run when when you run GitHub\nrun ls it just stops you know what I\nmean you have to press Q to to to get\nout of it\n>> it blocks I don't know why the GitHub\nCLI works that way\n>> but you don't have you have to do that\nin your in your terminal but if you do\nif you go in in cloud and you do execute\nter uh shell you will don't have to do\nit because the pager in in cloud is not\nset like the TTY is different.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But like in VS code um it\nruns it in the terminal and the page is\nthe same as your terminal and it gets\nstuck.\n>> Really cloud code did not get stuck for\nme.\n>> Yeah. But I understand the cloud code\nwouldn't because it has a different uh\nenvironment. But the the way that VS\nCode works slightly different. But\nanyway, what I'm trying to say here is\nthat um I wrote this and then I did a\ntest like do the thing like here's the\nthing\n>> with with the skill and then or or\nwithout the skill then with the skill\nand see if if the skill actually was\nused and did it actually even work. And\nthe funny thing was is that it was kind\nof helpful for um for for uh\n>> until you hit 40% context remain\n>> for for for OpenAI for for basically\ndumb models. But Claude 4.5 knew how to\nrun GH CLI without even uh me telling it\nto do it\n>> right. Yeah.\n>> So it's like what you said with beads.\nIt's like we're getting to a stage where\nlike the models are trained to do these\nthings to to get these new skills and\nthen you and then it gets to a point\nthen like why is that skill even there?\nIt's just it's just polluting the\ncontext, right? Because now the model\neven knows how to do this and I don't\neven have to tell it to do this.\n>> Yeah, it's a bit it's a bit subtler I\nthink because I think\nbut it's it's right. I mean ultimately\nit just directs in a way we don't\nunderstand how these things work right I\nmean it there's just like terabytes of\ndata going into\nlayers of of of what do they call it\n>> inference models or whatever\n>> it's more like neural neural networks\nyeah yeah but I I do I do things that\nthat I there's one step that I ask it to\ndo which I don't think it does\nautomatically\nAnd that is to check\nI mean the whole the whole GitHub CLI\nexperience is insane. They sort of hide\nthe the commit for some bizarre reason\nin the CLI.\n>> So basically I tell it to like please\ncheck what the commit was and make sure\nit's same as the one that's local.\nOtherwise we know we're getting off to a\nbad start.\n>> Right. Nice. Yeah. This is a type of\nlike small little details that you\nwouldn't get in a training corpus,\nright? That is like\n>> yeah,\n>> you know, if you're trying to do this\ntask, there's this little um catch that\nyou need to watch out for that that you\nneed to that the skill really is useful\nfor. But even then, like I feel that\nthese skills are they say that if you\nhit 40% context window remaining, then\nthe model models turn into dumb. It's\ntime to cut. Like the moment I see I'm\nI'm the task is complete. And if it's\nlike 45% I'm like okay time for the\nhandover you know don't try to tackle\nanything else. Uh because they will\nstart doing these things where even\nthough I have like the skill and I have\nit repeated in my initial prompt on the\nsession plus there's a skill plus I have\nto say it again and yet it still doesn't\ndo it sometimes. It's like okay\n>> yeah that's\nthat's we've talked about it before but\nI I see it a lot online. And it's like\nyeah I've I've given the skill I've\ngiven the claw MD but it doesn't\nactually do what I asked it to do.\nSo there's so so from so so from from\nboth angles we have a problem here like\nwe we have models are improving so that\nyou don't even need the skill and then\nthe other side that when you even write\nthe skill it doesn't take it on\nsome do better than others. It also\ndepends on what sort of need in the\ncontext. This is one thing that I\nrealized very weird. I was working on a\na project and I had like broken down the\ntasks. Um and\nand this is one of the things I talk\nabout why Ralph Wiggum is good because\nnormally you will break down the task\nand you will um you will create a big\nplan of this then that right do this\nthen do this then do this. But then if\nyou need to adjust course adjust in the\nmiddle you're kind of like oh where does\nthat go? and and if you have like a long\nlist of tasks, it's a bit harder to\nreadjust everything. Um, but what I was\ntrying to say is that\nfor some reason I had a very big task\nlist with very clear specifications on\neach task and I had never told it to do\nsomething. Um, and for some reason one\nof the previous hand session handoffs,\nmaybe Opus decided to add this little\nhelpful example code snippet, but it\ndoesn't match at all my original task\ndesign for the next next task. It says\ndo this. And so I I kicked off open\ncode. It was one of the first times I\nused open code and codeex in open code\nand it started to do this completely\ndifferent thing. And I was like, hold on\na minute. I never told it to do that.\nAnd I went, where does it come from? I\nstarted blaming open code from not\nreading the task properly. And then I\nnoticed it was in the session handle\nfrom Opus. I was like, where did Opus\nget that from? And then when I I I\nremoved it. I I get reset the whole\ntree, got rid of everything that open\ncode has done because I didn't want\nthat. It was one very early little code\nsnippet and I removed that little\nsnippet that Opus added for fun and\nsuddenly it worked perfectly exactly as\nas planned. So this can be frustrating\nif you don't pay attention. Yeah,\n>> I think like at the context degradation,\n>> for some reason it didn't follow the pre\npre-existing research and thought it\nmight be helpful and and and a little\nbit like do a little bit extra\nsometimes, right?\n>> Well, I guess going back to the whole\nproduct owner versus engineer, I think I\nthink engineers are a little bit more\ndetail orientated, right? We we would\nprobably catch that.\n>> I don't know. I I can't say those things\nbecause there's so many different\nengineers and owners product. I can't\nsay again like I said it's the people\nthat are able to reinvent themselves\neither they're an engineer or a product\nowner and they're able to to to get the\nreps in and to explore and they're\ncurious and they keep going at it even\nif it's not the perfect\n>> you are right I agree\n>> it's not because somebody decided to be\nowner\n>> why does\n>> one day\n>> why the hell doesn't any of Steve Jger's\n>> has to pass\n>> oh no it does pass it I needed a BD in\nit.\n>> Oh, so you needed a SQL database\n>> and then it worked.\n>> I mean, this is for gas town.\n>> Uh,\n>> I mean, did it? Yeah,\n>> now it's running the cache, right?\n>> Because go test by default, we know.\n>> How do you make it not dash count on the\nif you go to the make file? So cloud\nalways says it's actually dangerous when\nyou use cloud because um\n>> like how do I make it do a non-cash one?\nUh\n>> dash count\n>> dash count.\n>> Yeah, dash count one space one. That's\nwhat cloud always does.\n>> What does that work?\n>> What? How is that intuitive?\n>> It's about the parallelism of the task\nor something. If you do it again, I I\ndon't remember exactly, but when when\nyou were\n>> it's gonna be cached.\n>> Nope.\n>> What?\n>> Cash breaks\n>> just by doing count one.\n>> Yeah, there I remember why at some\npoint, but at this point, I don't care\nanymore cuz like when I see this and I\nask cloud, it just says it just at the\ncount. And like the first time I was\nlike, heck, why? Now I'm like, yeah,\nwhatever. You're right.\nDoes it does it do what I expect? Oh,\nyes it does. Okay. I I uh I have to go\nnow.\n>> Okay. Okay. Oh, generated by claw code.\nGenerated by claw code. Interesting.\n>> But look at who. It was Gus. It was\nJack.\n>> Who are these people?\n>> Author Kiru, Gus. These are the\ndifferent pcats in G in in in Gast Town.\nOh,\n>> Jack, Gus,\n>> George, Max,\n>> Dave,\nand then there's Deacon. And then\nthere's\n>> Black Finger.\n>> Wow, man. I got to have a closer look at\nthis. Okay, thanks for the chat. I think\nthat was good stuff. See you. Bye bye.",

You expected me to bump it\n[0:09] down.\n[0:10] >> Well, to be honest, I wanted to put it\n[0:11] like\n[0:13] second to uh you demoing the the thing\n[0:18] that you're trying to demo to me\n[0:19] >> cuz you're afraid we're going to run out\n[0:20] of time.\n[0:24] >> Oh my god, there's a lot to cover and I\n[0:25] need to basically take my kids off in 10\n[0:27] minutes. But like maybe\n[0:29] >> you call me 10 minutes before you go and\n[0:31] then\n[0:33] >> I don't know if you like like if you had\n[0:36] 10 minutes and you wanted to talk about\n[0:37] something what you want to talk about\n[0:39] you choose\n[0:40] >> the memes around Ralph Wigum.\n[0:44] I like him.\n[0:46] >> What what is Ralph Wigum?\n[0:49] >> Okay. So I saw a very niceation\n[0:52] >> where Ralph Wigum is a Simpson\n[0:55] character. the guy who sits on the train\n[0:58] in the class and that ate the crayons\n[1:00] and the very famous meme where he's on\n[1:02] the bus and the bus is about to crash\n[1:04] and he goes like I'm in danger. It's\n[1:07] like it's it's a classic character like\n[1:09] a clueless character. Um, and so it's\n[1:12] kind of fitting for the fact that you\n[1:14] just put it in put cloud in a loop. And\n[1:18] I like it um because one of the\n[1:20] breakdowns of why it is successful\n[1:23] is basically\n[1:26] it just means that um\n[1:33] that the models have become so good.\n[1:38] I I thought putting them in a loop was\n[1:42] pretty much what Gast Town was doing\n[1:43] with a little bit of coordination.\n[1:45] >> No, no, no. Gast Town. So I I like the\n[1:48] second blog post that that Steve Jger g\n[1:51] did, which is way more the background\n[1:52] than how it came to be what it is. I\n[1:54] think that's a gentle introduction to\n[1:56] Gast Town. So he has the original\n[1:57] announcement. Here's Gast Town. Cost\n[2:00] $600 a month to run it. It's crazy.\n[2:02] Don't do it. Caveat. Watch out. And um\n[2:05] and then he did a second and with a full\n[2:08] breakdown. It's very hard to follow\n[2:09] because it's like introducing all of\n[2:11] these different concepts but using you\n[2:14] know names that don't make sense like\n[2:17] bcats and and uh scrapyard and towns and\n[2:21] the way that towns communicate. I still\n[2:23] don't understand the difference between\n[2:25] like why can't you just say agents are\n[2:27] mailing each other? No, we have to see\n[2:29] bullot bulls live.\n[2:30] >> I think I I often think to myself that\n[2:34] uh in our industry terminology is\n[2:37] actually\n[2:39] a big part of what we do, right? Using\n[2:41] the right words is the right and and AI\n[2:45] agents\n[2:47] >> is already kind of overloaded as\n[2:49] >> sensitive to words. Oh, it's\n[2:52] >> I mean like agents I' I've seen if you\n[2:56] like I don't know if you go along on\n[2:57] YouTube and you and you like some people\n[3:00] have like weird ideas what agents are. I\n[3:03] think and like if if if you define it if\n[3:06] you call your agent PCAT and you define\n[3:08] what PCA does exactly and what where it\n[3:10] lives exactly and how it works exactly.\n[3:13] I think\n[3:13] >> it's very hard because then you're\n[3:14] introducing all these new concepts and\n[3:17] they don't have any relationship. But\n[3:19] that's what a a new a new idea a\n[3:22] groundbreaking idea will probably end up\n[3:25] doing, right? We'll invent three new\n[3:28] words in the process.\n[3:30] >> So this is why I I'm I'm defending Steve\n[3:33] in his in his crazy naming.\n[3:35] >> Yeah. But I have a history here of\n[3:37] coming into an organization as a DevOps\n[3:40] engineer and being told to de deploy\n[3:42] Okali and having to scram cuz first off\n[3:45] you weren't involved in the original\n[3:47] design of Okali. You have no idea what\n[3:49] Okalai is supposed to be. Then you have\n[3:51] to find\n[3:53] >> So okali are the what you call the\n[3:56] facets of the eyes of a bee and it was\n[3:59] basically the optic uh character\n[4:01] recognition engine for scanning receipts\n[4:03] at the supermarket at the team that I\n[4:06] was working at. So you see how annoying\n[4:09] it is. Uh and then another thing that's\n[4:11] very annoying. Yes, naming is is is is\n[4:14] difficult, but for me it was like just\n[4:16] tell me that you want the OCR scanner\n[4:18] microser deployed, right? Don't tell me\n[4:20] I have to go and figure out what OKAI is\n[4:23] >> at the same time. All these calls and\n[4:24] all this nonsense,\n[4:26] >> but at the same time\n[4:27] >> Yeah, but that that's kind of different.\n[4:29] I mean, that's like a project name as\n[4:31] opposed to But yeah, I get I get I get\n[4:34] what you're saying. It can be it can\n[4:35] work the other way very easily.\n[4:38] Yeah, I mean it makes sense I guess if\n[4:40] you if they are in in a in the nom\n[4:42] nomature like it was an or an an\n[4:44] organization called Honorsby. So it was\n[4:46] Okalai and Beehive and Beehive was a\n[4:49] product catalog but you know\n[4:50] >> Oh god no.\n[4:51] >> Yeah. Yeah. But you know you cringe the\n[4:53] moment I say this. I cringe the moment I\n[4:55] read like Paul Catz and all and then he\n[4:58] says to avoid copyright he mixes Mad Max\n[5:02] terminology with others uh to make sure\n[5:05] that like no single um enterprise can go\n[5:09] after you know him for copyright claims\n[5:11] or trademarks. He said, \"No wonder.\" And\n[5:13] no one. Anyway, what I was trying to say\n[5:15] is, and we were getting back to Ralph\n[5:17] Wiggum, is that\n[5:20] the second article is way better because\n[5:22] he really explains um exactly how and\n[5:26] how many iterations he went because he\n[5:28] create original vibe coder and then he\n[5:31] created VC and then he created a Python\n[5:34] version of Gastown. He had a couple of\n[5:36] workshops.\n[5:38] Uh I think it's the second one there.\n[5:39] Yeah. And then he did the Golang version\n[5:41] of Gaston and he he kind of explains his\n[5:44] experiences using Python versus Golang\n[5:47] and um you know what worked, what didn't\n[5:51] work and like he went to through three\n[5:52] or four iterations of um Gaston.\n[5:56] So\n[5:58] it's a very good I like this one. It's a\n[5:59] way more gentler introduction to how it\n[6:02] came to be what it is. Um but it is a\n[6:06] very interesting way and is a very\n[6:09] interesting\n[6:11] you know group of people are approaching\n[6:13] agent orchestration by building it in a\n[6:16] non-engineering\n[6:18] way. For example, is it better to create\n[6:21] git work trees and let every agent work\n[6:24] in an isolated work like git branch and\n[6:27] then deal with the branch conflicts like\n[6:30] merge conflicts or and that's another\n[6:32] approach. Is it better to all let them\n[6:35] all like let's say you're in three or\n[6:37] four agents at the same time on the same\n[6:39] file system and give them a way to\n[6:42] communicate with each other and reserve\n[6:44] files so that they don't create these\n[6:46] conflicts at in the first place. And as\n[6:48] an engineer,\n[6:49] >> yeah, blocking a folder or something.\n[6:51] Yeah.\n[6:51] >> Yeah. So, as an engineer, you come with\n[6:53] a long background of like git and\n[6:56] versioning and collaboration that takes\n[6:58] several days and you know this type of\n[7:00] workflow, whereas these agents work at a\n[7:02] very different like speed and have a\n[7:05] much better way of coordinating than us.\n[7:07] So, approaching it from a non-engineer\n[7:09] perspective, which is what um this guy,\n[7:11] I forgot his name now on Twitter. He\n[7:13] built the the mail system that Gasttown\n[7:15] uses. So basically this male MCP for\n[7:17] agents to communicate is all coming from\n[7:20] non-engineers looking at this O AI um\n[7:25] hype from a completely different angle\n[7:27] like a non-engineering angle and I\n[7:29] thought that was very interesting to\n[7:30] read and I think Ralph Wigum is also an\n[7:33] approach to that right stop trying to\n[7:35] build too many processes around these\n[7:37] agents and give them a very simple loop.\n[7:41] So have you have you tried it? Actually\n[7:43] I can relax now since um the school is\n[7:46] not opening in is delayed opening for 1\n[7:50] hour.\n[7:52] >> Oh because people were stuck.\n[7:55] >> We got time.\n[7:57] So that's good.\n[8:00] So yeah. Have you have you tried well\n[8:02] this uh approach then?\n[8:06] No, but I think the the one of the\n[8:09] breakdowns for it I thought was very\n[8:12] interesting breakdown because I think I\n[8:14] just I'm repeating myself. Sorry, I'm\n[8:15] distracted. Because it identifies that\n[8:18] the models have just become so much\n[8:19] better. And also I feel that kind of\n[8:21] reflects us as we are like you know this\n[8:24] didn't work but I finally found\n[8:25] something that worked and and and this\n[8:27] works 100%. I tried so many and it\n[8:29] didn't work but guess what?\n[8:30] >> Maybe it doesn't work because you found\n[8:32] the right way of doing it. Maybe it just\n[8:33] works so much better.\n[8:35] >> Personally, personally, I I thought AI\n[8:38] was was was interesting, but then when\n[8:40] Claude 4.5 came along, I thought to\n[8:43] myself, \"Holy moly.\" Yeah. So many\n[8:47] people now because I I avoided X for a\n[8:50] long time and but it used to be a very\n[8:52] good source of news, but you were\n[8:54] sharing me some threads and then I\n[8:56] decided to just start going through this\n[8:59] and and the\n[9:00] >> onex you mean.\n[9:01] >> Yeah. If you subscribe, if you follow\n[9:03] the right people, then it's insane. Like\n[9:06] the amount of\n[9:07] >> Yeah, that that tab is insane. But if\n[9:10] you\n[9:10] >> and the amount of people going like I\n[9:12] just spent two weeks during the holidays\n[9:14] with Opus with the double limits and I'm\n[9:18] sold. I'm sold. That's it.\n[9:20] >> I'm sold. I I I I enjoyed uh the\n[9:23] anthropic posts on on X like the the the\n[9:28] uh advent calendar and the that Boris\n[9:31] guy is also really good that the the the\n[9:35] what's his name?\n[9:37] God searching on uh the guy that that\n[9:40] invented Corker or\n[9:45] he he's great. Yeah. is I don't know if\n[9:48] you follow him, but he's he's posting\n[9:50] >> Boris. Yeah, because he people ask\n[9:52] things and he he replies to them and he\n[9:54] talks about his his his workflow,\n[9:57] >> but then he also replies, \"Oh, just do\n[9:58] this.\" Or he says, \"Yeah, that's a great\n[10:00] idea. Let me let me add that and we'll\n[10:02] add it to the backlog.\"\n[10:03] >> Yeah. Yeah. There was an epic one where\n[10:05] someone suggested something and then he\n[10:07] released it in 20 minutes.\n[10:11] >> Yeah. So,\n[10:13] >> and also that he says that he's what\n[10:14] merging 100 PRs and he has like\n[10:18] >> six um parallel agents and the way he\n[10:22] switches between his mobile and his his\n[10:25] >> I I I have I'm using my wife's\n[10:27] subscription\n[10:29] because I have API subscription through\n[10:31] work and I just don't want to mix it all\n[10:33] up. So the the the the thing that\n[10:36] confuses me or the thing that I want to\n[10:39] do, the workflow that I want to do is\n[10:40] that like I I have my clawed stuff or I\n[10:44] have my agents doing something, but say\n[10:46] I pop out to go fetch my kids and or I'm\n[10:49] in the supermarket. It would be nice to\n[10:51] to go on the Claude app and basically\n[10:54] see how those agents are doing, but but\n[10:56] right now there's no link between Claude\n[10:58] code u sessions and and the and the app.\n[11:03] And I thought he was alluding to the\n[11:05] fact that that this might be possible\n[11:07] because he said, you know, there's a\n[11:09] command in the cloud co\n[11:15] and uh but it but it doesn't actually do\n[11:18] anything.\n[11:19] >> Yeah. There was another very cool one.\n[11:21] Um, people are more and more saying like\n[11:25] I need my laptop like my cloud code on\n[11:28] my laptop because it has everything\n[11:30] installed. And Boris, I don't know how\n[11:32] he does it, but he must I don't know\n[11:34] maybe he has a custom sandbox internally\n[11:36] within Antropic that has all the tools\n[11:38] that has more than what we get when\n[11:39] we're on the web. But\n[11:41] >> we get like if you use cloud code on the\n[11:44] web, there's a lot of restrictions on it\n[11:46] obviously because they don't want people\n[11:47] to start running crypto miners.\n[11:50] And so basically he um somebody says\n[11:53] what if I can just like run a T-max um\n[11:57] from my laptop or like a reverse tunnel,\n[11:59] you know, like Angro and have that\n[12:01] exposed through the web so that I can\n[12:03] just be on my mobile.\n[12:04] >> This this might help you. Bars, help me.\n[12:05] I hit my weekly limit slash extra usage.\n[12:09] Yeah. You know what that is?\n[12:12] >> It just starts using your it starts\n[12:14] using your wallet with the API costs.\n[12:18] >> So like you you use you pay $20 a month.\n[12:21] You put $5 or maybe you put $20 in your\n[12:24] wallet. You you hit the five hour\n[12:26] session limit and you go like, you know\n[12:27] what, I would really love Opus to finish\n[12:29] this. And you like go like, yes, extra\n[12:31] usage. And it burns through $20 within\n[12:34] like within like an hour. And you go\n[12:37] like, what? I just paid $20 a month and\n[12:39] now I just burn to another 20 in an\n[12:42] hour. It's very very painful, but it\n[12:45] does help if you're in a rush.\n[12:47] >> This is also interesting. Opus 4.5 is\n[12:49] Ralph Wigum and Playright is AGI.\n[12:52] >> I disagree. Those are people I talked to\n[12:55] one guy and he has like an enterprise\n[12:57] access and he says, \"Yeah, I I I burn\n[12:59] millions of tokens like like you\n[13:01] mentioned before. They have thousands of\n[13:03] dollars.\" Then maybe you can you can use\n[13:05] Playright MCP. But if you're on a a\n[13:08] normal subscription,\n[13:09] >> so the last podcast upload.\n[13:13] >> Yeah.\n[13:14] >> If um and you can find it on debase.com\n[13:17] podcast,\n[13:20] >> the thought that's been jiggling around\n[13:21] my mind since we last spoke is is valid.\n[13:24] >> How do you test and validate stuff?\n[13:27] >> Yep.\n[13:27] >> Do you have do you have the solution for\n[13:29] that? Because Yeah. Like when I read\n[13:31] this um this tweet about\n[13:33] >> about playright being the agi you were\n[13:35] saying to me no you're running play\n[13:37] right wrong with MCP so so how do you\n[13:39] run play right right play right right\n[13:43] should be a rapper okay so what is my\n[13:46] problem with MCPS and also the problem\n[13:48] that both Cloudflare and Antropic have\n[13:50] highlighted is that it's a massive token\n[13:53] waste that sending all of the characters\n[13:57] across on every turn one by one I've hit\n[14:00] it myself several times. It's very\n[14:01] frustrating.\n[14:02] >> Right. So when you use the playright\n[14:05] MCP, it will take screenshots which is B\n[14:09] 64 encoded image. So that's the\n[14:10] significant amount of characters. It\n[14:12] will take a structural document like\n[14:17] some type of YAML representation or an\n[14:19] XML representation of the whole page.\n[14:21] It's not really XML because it's like\n[14:23] more of a structure of all of the\n[14:25] elements. Um it's a it's a strange I\n[14:27] don't know this representation. I'm not\n[14:29] a front end engineer, you know, but but\n[14:31] it takes it some type of of skeleton,\n[14:33] not a screenshot, but sometimes of like\n[14:35] structure, it also sends that down to\n[14:37] the model. Um, and and all of this\n[14:40] information is like so much. But when\n[14:44] you use playwright as a as a scripting\n[14:47] engine, basically you write you write a\n[14:50] script, right? you say first go to this\n[14:52] URL\n[14:53] >> then click on the login page\n[14:56] >> then you will be redirected\n[14:57] automatically to another page wait for\n[14:59] the um username text box to be available\n[15:02] or element to be available\n[15:03] >> I have scripts like that myself\n[15:05] >> but that's a script that is a maybe you\n[15:08] know 20 lines and that gets generated by\n[15:12] the LLM and sent to playright and it\n[15:16] executes in one go and it may get the\n[15:19] reading that script\n[15:21] wastes a ton of tokens in my experience.\n[15:24] >> Oh, it doesn't. Why would it? What? It\n[15:26] literally didn't not I I never wrote\n[15:28] playright in my life and I was like I\n[15:30] would love to be able to do more of an\n[15:32] end to end. So maybe I share my screen.\n[15:34] I don't have\n[15:35] >> Okay.\n[15:35] >> Uh\n[15:37] >> Okay.\n[15:38] Yeah, you got to you got to demonstrate\n[15:40] this workflow. I'm very curious. Like\n[15:42] for example, could you could you show a\n[15:45] workflow where um\n[15:49] >> not on requests? I can show you what I\n[15:51] have.\n[15:51] >> Okay.\n[15:53] >> No, but I want to see how you create it.\n[15:54] Like go to like debase.com\n[15:57] >> and also\n[15:58] >> listen to a podcast or something. I mean\n[15:59] that's very simple. There's no login\n[16:01] here or anything.\n[16:03] >> Validate that there's a\n[16:04] >> send me that in advance and I will try\n[16:07] >> Kim.\n[16:09] >> Yeah.\n[16:09] >> Thank you. Thank you uh Abiooft for\n[16:12] creating Kalema. I mean I'd be dead if I\n[16:15] didn't I mean Mac OS would so suck if it\n[16:18] didn't add Kalema. Yeah. All the other\n[16:20] ones you need to pay, right?\n[16:24] >> Exactly.\n[16:26] >> Yeah. So, I have like test users, Alice\n[16:28] user, platform user, new user with no\n[16:30] groups and and I'm validating that these\n[16:33] users are not able, you know, to do\n[16:35] things. So, it has like\n[16:37] >> you coded this with the AI, right?\n[16:39] >> Yeah. I I don't know how to write any of\n[16:41] this. I have not written a single letter\n[16:44] of code in this test.\n[16:45] >> Okay. Okay. So, so it's 170 lines.\n[16:49] >> Okay.\n[16:49] >> Right.\n[16:50] >> Um\n[16:52] the the setup thing\n[16:55] is the coolest thing because it does the\n[16:57] E2E setup which um as you can see it\n[17:02] makes sure that the containers are\n[17:03] running and then it makes sure that the\n[17:05] users like it creates a user by creating\n[17:07] the Alice user inside um inside click\n[17:10] and and creates the test user with\n[17:12] certain password\n[17:14] and and and everything. It also goes\n[17:16] against my API to register the user\n[17:18] role. So if if I in kick look I create a\n[17:20] user a certain group membership and in\n[17:22] my API I create group membership to role\n[17:25] mapping. So it does both ends. Okay.\n[17:27] Right. So this playright test. So that's\n[17:30] like a UI for running the script.\n[17:33] >> Yes. So and this is this is gold and uh\n[17:37] because if I\n[17:38] >> it's amazing I tell you. So once\n[17:40] everything's up right now the server is\n[17:42] up and they're listening.\n[17:44] >> Yeah. and and I can just go for example\n[17:46] I want to do a successful login and\n[17:49] succession persistence test. So I'm\n[17:51] going to log in and then I'm going to\n[17:52] refresh and make sure I'm still logged\n[17:53] in. Right? So I close the console. The\n[17:56] there's nothing here. It did not run.\n[17:57] When I click it and when you trigger\n[17:59] them it's going to run them all in\n[18:00] parallel. This is running in a separate\n[18:02] Chrome browser. So in this case it goes\n[18:04] to sign in with SSO\n[18:07] but clearly it's it failed. Oh no it\n[18:11] didn't fail. It didn't fail. Sorry it\n[18:12] passed. It's green, right? There's some\n[18:14] error messages here. 401 unauthorized.\n[18:16] That's my API because my web asks um\n[18:20] like the login status and you get a 401\n[18:22] if you're not logged in. So these\n[18:24] console error messages I have to get rid\n[18:25] of at some point. That's my who am I\n[18:27] endpoint. Anyway, you can see here it\n[18:29] ran very fast, right? It took 3 seconds.\n[18:32] So it navigated.\n[18:33] >> So what ran in parallel? I didn't quite\n[18:34] understand.\n[18:36] >> I just ran one. I just ran this one.\n[18:38] >> But if you run them, you can if I click\n[18:39] this one, it's going to run all of\n[18:40] these. You can click this one. It's\n[18:42] going to run all of them. And it's going\n[18:43] to all run in separate headless uh not\n[18:45] headless, it's going to run all in\n[18:46] Chrome uh instances separated\n[18:49] individually. All run at the same time.\n[18:51] All different workers, Chrome workers.\n[18:52] So So I just ran one. So it went to the\n[18:55] website and then it says not\n[18:57] authenticated. It clicked on sign in. It\n[18:59] was redirected to Keycloak. It entered\n[19:02] the test user which was part of the\n[19:03] bootstrap. It clicked on login. Yeah.\n[19:05] >> Then it went it was automatically\n[19:06] redirected to the to the API and it\n[19:09] waited for the selector. So this is\n[19:11] something that that you learn.\n[19:13] Originally the the LLM did not generate\n[19:16] any test ID onto the elements inside the\n[19:19] browser. So it look for text like it\n[19:21] looks for like the login button and\n[19:23] things like that.\n[19:24] >> But if you then after a while I think\n[19:25] open code C codeex or Gemini said you\n[19:28] know what would make it really easy if\n[19:30] you would add test ID to each of these\n[19:32] elements. I was like what what is test\n[19:34] ID? I was like, well, you know, if you\n[19:35] want to do playright scripts, you just\n[19:36] add like little attributes to each of\n[19:38] these elements and then\n[19:39] >> it just it just came up with that in a\n[19:41] coding session.\n[19:42] >> Yeah, I have no idea. Like, again, I\n[19:44] have never written playright in my life.\n[19:46] I have not done this. I'm not a front-\n[19:48] end engineer. And it just said, let's\n[19:50] use a test ID. I was like, okay,\n[19:52] awesome. Do it.\n[19:53] >> And so, it waits for the selector\n[19:55] >> and then it's it\n[19:58] reloads to make sure that the user is\n[20:00] still logged in, right? And then it\n[20:01] verifies I expect to still be logged in.\n[20:03] And then I guess it opens this uh login\n[20:06] screen on the right and it sees I'm\n[20:08] logged in and I have a product engineer\n[20:09] role because I'm a product engineer\n[20:11] group membership. Right? But what if I\n[20:14] want to you know what if I introduce\n[20:16] failure, right? So again this did not\n[20:19] involve right now I ran my own make\n[20:21] target but this did not involve any you\n[20:24] know back and forth between the LLM and\n[20:27] the MCP server directing Chrome anything\n[20:30] like that right it was a single script\n[20:31] and it ran the full thing end to end and\n[20:34] then it gets the result it gets the\n[20:36] console it gets the errors at every\n[20:37] stage you can see exactly what was the\n[20:41] state of the web browser at that point\n[20:43] um so if I if I close this then the make\n[20:46] target will finish.\n[20:49] So now if I um go and change something\n[20:53] for example in my outflow or maybe in my\n[20:55] page maybe in my web app I will I will\n[20:59] remove the test ID for example so it\n[21:00] can't find the element. So let's go\n[21:03] under\n[21:03] >> Yeah. Yeah. I like this idea testing for\n[21:05] failure.\n[21:06] >> Yeah.\n[21:09] No login pace. Is there like test ID?\n[21:13] >> No. Where is the test ID even? you know\n[21:16] your code base inside out.\n[21:18] >> I haven't touched this. I haven't I\n[21:20] haven't touched this for um\n[21:25] for like\n[21:27] ever. I don't know.\n[21:28] >> This is when you when you start whipping\n[21:30] out copilot, please make a failing test.\n[21:34] >> Yeah, there's some here like it tries to\n[21:36] it tries to make sure that the edges\n[21:38] exist between states. And here is the\n[21:40] list view. It tries to make sure that a\n[21:43] certain um state ID is listed after you\n[21:47] this is part of the create. So there's\n[21:49] one test that does that does a create\n[21:51] creates a state but my my dashboard is\n[21:53] supposed to be read only but I wanted to\n[21:55] test permissions so I added the create\n[21:56] state button.\n[21:58] It's like oh my god I have to remove\n[22:00] that. Um even for the notification it\n[22:02] tries to make sure that there's an error\n[22:03] message. So maybe if I remove the toast\n[22:07] test ID, let's say I remove this and\n[22:09] then I find the test that looks for\n[22:11] notification toast. So let's find that.\n[22:15] >> Um, it's definitely not in the TSX. It's\n[22:16] going to be in the test scripts, I\n[22:18] think.\n[22:19] >> I think you your\n[22:21] didn't work.\n[22:22] >> Yeah.\n[22:24] >> Oh, by the way, did you try a marachi?\n[22:29] Yeah, I am using a much I'm using Arch\n[22:31] by the way, but not here.\n[22:33] >> But but you but did you try a March?\n[22:36] >> Yeah, I'm using of course I'm not going\n[22:38] to use Arch without a March. What kind\n[22:40] of lunatic do you think I am?\n[22:42] >> Well, but like I installed it the ISO\n[22:45] yesterday. I was very impressed.\n[22:47] >> Yeah,\n[22:47] >> I've got it on my on my uh my ThinkPad.\n[22:50] >> Just don't run the like screen saver\n[22:54] because it crashed constantly and it\n[22:57] kills Hyperland. Okay. So, you're using\n[22:59] Omari,\n[23:01] of course.\n[23:02] >> Yeah. So, there's this thing checks for\n[23:04] a success notification. So, there's some\n[23:07] uh here verify state created looks for a\n[23:10] success notification which looks for uh\n[23:15] locates ro alert. No, that's not what I\n[23:17] want. I want to know the one that has\n[23:19] like\n[23:21] toast notification. So, it added the\n[23:24] test IDs, but it's not using them.\n[23:27] Nice. Uh,\n[23:31] >> yeah. So,\n[23:32] >> I'm sure it's using it. So, here it's\n[23:33] using them here. Let's look for those.\n[23:35] It used for out profile button. So, let\n[23:37] me remove the out profile button. So,\n[23:39] let me let me remove the test ID. So, it\n[23:41] can't find that anymore. And then it\n[23:42] will fail the test because it's not\n[23:44] there. Right. Let's look for\n[23:46] >> call it button two or something. I don't\n[23:48] know why you want to do this.\n[23:50] >> Yeah. So what I wanted to get out of\n[23:52] this conversation is that I wanted to\n[23:53] know that there's some a good way of\n[23:56] testing\n[23:58] uh an AI generated product and making\n[24:01] sure that it's consistent and doesn't\n[24:04] break for users and things like that.\n[24:07] Okay, let's run it again. The So this\n[24:10] helper is the\n[24:13] this is the login via keycloak. So it's\n[24:15] going to fail the login via K clock\n[24:18] because I I removed it. So the first\n[24:21] thing one that we did should fail this\n[24:23] time and we should get like a clear\n[24:25] error message of why it failed\n[24:27] >> and where and where where in the code\n[24:29] >> and you get an LLM prompt also from from\n[24:32] playright\n[24:34] >> which is the craziest part.\n[24:35] >> Yeah.\n[24:36] >> Huh? What\n[24:37] >> you get an LLM prompt. It's going to say\n[24:38] it failed on this step. Here's your LLM\n[24:40] prompt to find it. Find the fix.\n[24:42] >> Is this part of playright already? This\n[24:44] is part of play, right?\n[24:46] >> This is why I'm like whoever like I try\n[24:49] to find online resources. Every single\n[24:51] one is about the MCP. I'm like why is\n[24:54] nobody talking about this this awesome\n[24:55] features that are in in playright that\n[24:57] are like way better than the stupid MCP.\n[25:00] So okay, let's close the console again.\n[25:01] >> Yeah, the\n[25:03] >> this one should fail now. It should\n[25:04] >> a lot of people have gone off the ball\n[25:05] with MCP.\n[25:08] >> Yeah, expect to be visit. Wait, wait,\n[25:10] wait.\n[25:14] It's probably going to time out, right?\n[25:17] >> Kaboom.\n[25:18] >> May maybe I need to build my web app\n[25:19] again. No, it failed. It errors, right?\n[25:22] >> Yeah,\n[25:22] >> it failed here.\n[25:24] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[25:24] >> Here it says expect locator to be\n[25:26] visible failed.\n[25:27] >> Yeah,\n[25:28] >> it says locator here and then copy\n[25:30] prompt.\n[25:31] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[25:31] >> And you go into your code and you go\n[25:33] into cloud and you say, \"Hey, um, well,\n[25:36] don't use this prompt because it's going\n[25:38] to\n[25:39] >> That's the biggest prompt I've ever seen\n[25:40] in my life. It's like 20 pages. How many\n[25:43] lines of code is that?\"\n[25:45] >> But it's everything that you would It's\n[25:47] It's a lot shorter.\n[25:49] >> Just scroll just scroll down. Like, how\n[25:51] how long is this thing? Just scroll\n[25:52] down.\n[25:52] >> Keep your knickers on.\n[25:56] >> They're on. Trust me.\n[25:58] >> 300 lines. Not that much. Come on.\n[26:02] >> What the hell? That's but that's\n[26:04] amazing. But at the same time,\n[26:05] >> it's absolutely amazing because it goes\n[26:07] like look this is what the page is.\n[26:09] Here's the YAML. This is the page\n[26:10] snapshot. The thing I told you it has\n[26:12] this this YAML representation of the\n[26:14] page. And if I give this if I just give\n[26:17] this right now\n[26:18] >> HTML\n[26:20] >> it 100% cloud will go like yo the the\n[26:23] loc the location button has a two to it.\n[26:25] It changed for sure. It will find it in\n[26:28] a sec in an instant.\n[26:30] Not even going to I'm not giving it\n[26:32] permission to write. I'm just going to\n[26:34] launch cloud real fast.\n[26:36] Paste that in.\n[26:38] >> Probably going to waste $10 on this on\n[26:40] this uh\n[26:42] >> now. I haven't used cloud all day. It's\n[26:43] fine.\n[26:45] Use 77% of the commitment.\n[26:49] >> It's fine. It resets um on the Thursday.\n[26:53] Yeah, it's still enough. 25% for\n[26:55] Wednesday should be enough. One day more\n[26:58] than enough.\n[27:00] Okay, look. It didn't even have to go\n[27:02] through anything like the test expect\n[27:04] the element to be like this. But your\n[27:07] profile button\n[27:09] um would you like me to read? Yes, read\n[27:11] it. Let's read. It didn't read. It just\n[27:15] said uh it fails because the it looking\n[27:17] for this button. It can't find this\n[27:18] button. So, it hasn't even read the odd\n[27:20] state yet, but immediately it's going to\n[27:21] say, \"Oh, you have a the test ID\n[27:24] change.\"\n[27:24] >> Okay. Well, I\n[27:26] >> There you go. It says like there there's\n[27:28] your problem. The test ID doesn't match.\n[27:29] >> Okay. Very good demo. Very good demo.\n[27:33] Vincent,\n[27:33] >> not not prepared at all. But but but now\n[27:36] do you trust me? Because earlier you\n[27:38] were like you you did not trust me. You\n[27:40] even wanted to hang up the\n[27:42] >> I still think the the creating the these\n[27:46] tests is is damn expensive. But\n[27:50] um like I'm just thinking like like\n[27:52] legacy applications where\n[27:55] >> that's what I was telling you. I was\n[27:56] telling you that none of the\n[27:57] applications that we've written so far\n[27:59] have these things in place. But if you\n[28:02] if you one thing is with LLMs you can\n[28:05] actually spend you say it's expensive\n[28:07] but how much do you pay for a QA\n[28:09] engineer? $5,000 a month. How much do\n[28:11] you pay for cloud? I pay 30 $30 a month\n[28:14] and it did all of this for me.\n[28:16] >> But it's it's also Yeah. I mean\n[28:21] >> you're right. You're right.\n[28:23] >> You're right. You're right. You're\n[28:24] right. It's I actually never thought\n[28:27] about the the poor QA engineer who's\n[28:29] going to be threatened by AI. But now\n[28:31] I'm thinking\n[28:32] >> but the QA engineer would have saved me\n[28:34] money because I wouldn't have written\n[28:36] all of the tests without test IDs. It\n[28:38] would have immediately thought like hey\n[28:39] we need playright we need test IDs. Stop\n[28:43] this right.\n[28:43] >> Well\n[28:45] >> well I no I'm just thinking aloud that\n[28:46] there's no need for a test engine.\n[28:50] I mean that that job is\n[28:52] >> now you need to be all right. You need\n[28:54] to pick it up quickly and you can learn\n[28:56] quickly from the LLM.\n[28:58] >> You need to know workflows like you the\n[28:59] one you just showed me. So hopefully\n[29:01] >> which is why I think\n[29:02] >> the podcast viewers will will rate the\n[29:05] podcast or or like it to say that hey I\n[29:08] learned something thanks to Vincent's\n[29:10] demo right now\n[29:12] >> which Kai didn't trust. Never going to\n[29:14] make that mistake.\n[29:15] >> A healthy skeptic skepticism.\n[29:18] Okay. So that that approach shows me\n[29:20] that you tested it with playright,\n[29:23] but I just c can we have a quick look at\n[29:25] beads because that that confuses the\n[29:27] hell out of\n[29:28] >> Yeah, go ahead because you had a lot of\n[29:29] questions about beats. You took already\n[29:31] this screen I guess.\n[29:32] >> Um no I haven't actually\n[29:35] screen\n[29:37] >> but can you now understand that all of\n[29:38] this material maybe it should be the\n[29:40] first dabbase.com blog going about stop\n[29:43] using playride mcp and use playrite the\n[29:45] right way. Why don't why don't you write\n[29:47] a blog? Jesus Christ. It's still\n[29:50] I need you to I need you to help me out\n[29:52] here. I'm dying.\n[29:54] >> I don't know because Oh, blog on the\n[29:56] base or blog. I don't really have you\n[29:59] have\n[29:59] >> you can you can blog on the base. It's\n[30:01] just do a pull request.\n[30:04] >> Ah, guest blogs.\n[30:06] >> Okay. So, here we I'm I'm sharing the\n[30:08] screen now. Hopefully, everyone can see\n[30:09] my screen. This is beads, baby. Okay.\n[30:12] One thing that confuses me is that when\n[30:14] you look at the workflow runs, they all\n[30:18] fail.\n[30:19] So that makes me think like, well, what\n[30:23] how come they're even failing? Because,\n[30:25] you know, they're using AI.\n[30:28] >> Check the CI. The only way to make sure\n[30:30] if something is properly tested looking\n[30:32] at the CI.\n[30:33] >> Okay. It looks like it's the Golint is\n[30:37] is failing. But but still,\n[30:40] >> can you see my screen?\n[30:41] Yeah, probably. I just can't see you. I\n[30:43] don't know where you are.\n[30:44] >> Uhhuh. Whatever. So, I mean, it's a bit\n[30:47] trivial here. Like, it's a golden error,\n[30:49] but like why didn't like the hook or\n[30:52] something pick that up?\n[30:54] >> It's been failing for ages. Um, so that\n[30:57] that's that's my first question about\n[30:59] beads.\n[31:00] >> No, hold on a minute. I think I Oh, now\n[31:02] I can see it. Okay,\n[31:04] >> the next the next thing. Okay, like say\n[31:06] so say this is release 0.440.\n[31:12] Okay. So, we should be able to see uh\n[31:14] >> Oh, you're right. All of the all of the\n[31:15] G actions are failing.\n[31:17] >> Yeah,\n[31:18] >> that's ridiculous.\n[31:19] >> Yeah. So, like how does he even release\n[31:20] it when everything's failing? So, it\n[31:22] just shows me that\n[31:23] >> that's why I haven't updated for a\n[31:24] while.\n[31:26] >> But like I mean\n[31:27] >> that's the question.\n[31:29] >> Okay. Now, let's have a look at this.\n[31:31] Like if I go, it's clone it out. You can\n[31:35] see my screen, right?\n[31:37] >> Yes. So, if you go if you go into beads,\n[31:40] so get tag. Oh my god, this is probably\n[31:43] going to show you how how incompetent I\n[31:46] am. Where's the latest bloody tag? Okay,\n[31:49] so this So, if I go get uh switch, I\n[31:52] think that should work, shouldn't it?\n[31:55] Uh,\n[31:58] >> don't\n[32:00] get check out on the tag directly. Yes.\n[32:03] >> Um, I think I need to still create a\n[32:06] branch, don't I? uh release.\n[32:10] Okay, so this is 04440\n[32:16] and I think if if you run scripts tests,\n[32:20] it should pass, right?\n[32:24] Well, if the CI is failing,\n[32:27] then I would not expect it to pass on a\n[32:29] machine that doesn't have any special\n[32:31] setup.\n[32:36] >> To me, the CI is the validation that\n[32:40] >> you need to say to anyone like\n[32:42] >> it's a you problem because it works on\n[32:44] the machine. So, it's your machine\n[32:46] problem. If the if the CI is not\n[32:48] working, I cannot say anything.\n[32:49] >> Yeah. So I I ran I ran scripts test\n[32:52] essential on a on a main checkout and it\n[32:56] failed and I was like what how can this\n[32:57] possibly be basically so yeah here here\n[33:01] look it's failing\n[33:04] >> in get in in go test it's failing in the\n[33:07] CI yet he makes a release\n[33:11] I'm I'm totally confused\n[33:17] interesting very interesting\n[33:21] Steve,\n[33:21] >> very worrying.\n[33:22] >> Steve, what the hell are you doing, man?\n[33:26] >> Wait, he's watches. All of this. All of\n[33:28] this.\n[33:28] >> He what? Of course he watches.\n[33:31] >> Hey, Steve.\n[33:32] >> Hey, Boris.\n[33:35] >> Thanks for tuning in, man.\n[33:37] >> Hey, Slam, man.\n[33:41] >> Can we go to the Ralph Wigan memes?\n[33:43] >> Yeah, let's let's go to the Ralph Wigan\n[33:45] memes.\n[33:46] >> I don't Are you familiar with um with\n[33:48] Invincible?\n[33:51] So the cartoon characters there is in is\n[33:54] the Vuvian\n[33:56] of in\n[33:57] >> this is a Marvel thing, isn't it?\n[33:59] >> No, like it's it's like this\n[34:01] anti-heroes.\n[34:03] So, and that's a spoiler for season for\n[34:06] maybe the first three episodes of season\n[34:08] one, but\n[34:09] >> Oh, no. I'm not going to watch this\n[34:10] crap.\n[34:11] >> Yeah. So, so it's a lot of these heroes\n[34:15] comic books, they're now like the heroes\n[34:17] are actually super villains.\n[34:19] >> Um, like the boys and and Jenv and and\n[34:21] and Invincible, but but it's pretty\n[34:23] funny because\n[34:24] >> he is this super it's like a play on\n[34:27] Superman, but he comes from like\n[34:29] Krypton,\n[34:31] planet Krypton. Um, so he's like a\n[34:33] Superman inside Earth and he's they're\n[34:36] looking at um airplanes that are flying\n[34:38] and he's he's telling his son, but he he\n[34:40] basically his role is to prepare Earth\n[34:43] for takeover. So he's supposed to\n[34:45] destroy all of the Earth defenses. Yeah.\n[34:48] >> So um but his son um is supposed to, you\n[34:53] know, follow in his footsteps but\n[34:55] refuses. And so he's telling him like,\n[34:57] \"Look at what they need to mimic a\n[34:59] fraction of our power because they need\n[35:01] all of these machines to fly and all,\n[35:02] but we we have so much more power.\" And\n[35:05] and so basically here the GPT 5.2 users\n[35:08] are making fun of it because I think\n[35:10] it's very funny a very funny meme\n[35:13] because when you use cloud code, it goes\n[35:15] very fast but it makes mistakes, right?\n[35:18] So you put it in a loop but if you use\n[35:20] codeex or GPD 5.2 two, it goes very\n[35:23] slow, but it ends up being correct\n[35:26] because it like spends a lot of time\n[35:28] actually reasoning and making changes.\n[35:30] It kind of has the loop built in and and\n[35:32] and that's kind of a\n[35:33] >> joke. So, GPT 5.2 already has this kind\n[35:37] of flow\n[35:38] >> because, you know, it's so much slower\n[35:40] and people are like, I hate GPT5 because\n[35:42] it's so slow. It's not feel doesn't feel\n[35:43] snappy. But then on the other side, you\n[35:45] have all these cloud users that are so\n[35:47] snappy having to put it into a stupid\n[35:49] loop. Yeah, that's a typical trade-off\n[35:50] between\n[35:52] speed and uh\n[35:55] and uh quality, I suppose. If it's fast\n[35:59] enough, it doesn't really matter, does\n[36:01] it? Or\n[36:02] >> it can pave over the cracks quickly or\n[36:04] something. I\n[36:04] >> I don't know. It depends on the\n[36:06] complexity of the task, you know, and\n[36:07] because we're so bad at selecting the\n[36:10] the models ourselves or the automatic\n[36:11] selecting doesn't really work well. I'm\n[36:14] happy to have a model that is very\n[36:15] snappy for most of the things that I\n[36:17] need it to do and then when it needs to\n[36:19] do a super hard troubleshooting thing\n[36:21] that I need to let it loop a bit I'm\n[36:23] also okay with it or maybe I just switch\n[36:25] over myself but I would rather have\n[36:27] something that's always fast than\n[36:29] something like GPT5.\n[36:32] Yeah, I thought it was a funny a funny u\n[36:35] you know reference.\n[36:36] >> Open code became the default on Omari\n[36:41] >> default\n[36:42] >> the default. So, Omari ships with CH GPT\n[36:45] and cloud code and they switched u as a\n[36:48] default CLI agent to open code. So, they\n[36:51] use Ghosti already by default and now\n[36:53] they made open I mean they just added\n[36:55] the package as far as I could tell. But\n[36:57] yeah, yeah, I'm I'm so impressed with\n[36:59] Omari. Um\n[37:02] I'm really impressed.\n[37:03] >> But the the greatest thing about it is\n[37:05] Omari DHH is very much focused on um the\n[37:08] the theming, right? He he forked\n[37:11] chromium so just that he could apply the\n[37:13] theme\n[37:13] >> color. I think the theming is a way of\n[37:15] hook of attracting people. I mean I\n[37:17] think I think I think DHH is is next\n[37:20] level. I think he has a very good sense\n[37:22] of taste. You need that that that polish\n[37:26] that that the Linux desktop has been\n[37:29] missing. and Amachi with the themes. I I\n[37:32] know for for power users it's it's a bit\n[37:35] of a waste of space, but like I I\n[37:37] understand why he's gone gone that way.\n[37:41] I I mean the whole the whole install\n[37:43] process. Did you run through this\n[37:44] install process too?\n[37:46] >> Yeah, just like you have the same\n[37:47] pictures and I posted on Instagram, not\n[37:50] on Twitter.\n[37:53] >> It's just it's just amazing like like\n[37:55] when you install Windows, it takes you\n[37:56] like half a day. This took like this\n[37:58] takes three minutes.\n[37:59] >> He does it on on stage, right? Uh here I\n[38:04] had the whole actually when uh let me\n[38:06] turn off the the\n[38:07] >> It's so amazing. I If you're not using\n[38:10] Amarachi, why aren't you using Amarachi?\n[38:12] It's amazing.\n[38:14] >> Yeah.\n[38:16] >> The the coolest thing is that\n[38:18] >> he he he's also even solved copy and\n[38:20] paste. Like copy and paste works really\n[38:21] well. The super\n[38:23] >> So I was like asking CHPT. This was like\n[38:26] when it was booting. Oh yeah, it has the\n[38:28] whole uh it's a video basically. What?\n[38:31] >> Oh my god. This you this. Please stop\n[38:34] these handheld videos.\n[38:36] >> How are you going to make a screen uh\n[38:38] capture when it's booting?\n[38:40] >> Well, you you can get one of these.\n[38:42] >> You are you have Why did you take a\n[38:43] picture with your lap phone of your of\n[38:45] your\n[38:46] >> True, but it's at least it's better.\n[38:48] It's It's less irritating than a video.\n[38:50] >> And this one. Stop. I sent you one and\n[38:53] now I show you a second.\n[38:54] >> No. What was your installed? What was\n[38:56] your time?\n[38:58] What was your time?\n[38:59] >> Can you show the time? Uh, 6 minutes and\n[39:01] 20 seconds.\n[39:02] >> Oh my god, what a loser.\n[39:05] >> I How come it mine was so slow? It's a\n[39:07] Vietnam internet, dude. I'm not on a\n[39:09] backbone. What kind of internet\n[39:10] connection do you have?\n[39:12] >> What? A gigabit?\n[39:14] >> Yeah. The fact that you have like a IP\n[39:15] range tells me you probably pay a\n[39:17] shitload of money for a backbone\n[39:19] internet connection straight a pipe\n[39:20] straight to your bedroom.\n[39:22] >> Yeah. I don't know if you do anything\n[39:25] like this, but like what I like to do is\n[39:26] is I I smoke ping my internet connection\n[39:29] to like for example S3 endpoints so I\n[39:32] know exactly if my S3 endpoint is is uh\n[39:36] sucking or doing something weird.\n[39:39] >> Okay. So it's definitely internet\n[39:41] problems for me because\n[39:43] >> Yeah. I mean\n[39:44] >> because it was you choose to live in a\n[39:45] third world country.\n[39:47] >> Oh, you also did it on a new NVME SSD\n[39:49] that you bought, right?\n[39:50] >> Huh? You als we also just at the same\n[39:53] time bought\n[39:53] >> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I installed it on a new\n[39:55] This is the same I Well, you Okay. You\n[39:59] have this You have the high-end Samsung\n[40:01] one that cost\n[40:02] >> and it still took 6 minutes and your\n[40:04] shitty end one it took three minutes.\n[40:05] >> Well, I got the micron the micron.\n[40:09] Um yeah, like I'm just quite bullish\n[40:12] about Omari and uh the future the I feel\n[40:17] like the tiling has been pretty amazing\n[40:20] manager,\n[40:21] >> huh?\n[40:21] >> The tiling window manager takes a while\n[40:23] to get used to though.\n[40:25] >> I mean to be honest, I'm I'm a full\n[40:27] screen kind of guy. I I mean I I have my\n[40:29] my workspaces 1 2 3 4 5.\n[40:32] >> Yeah.\n[40:32] >> I mean I've been I've been using DWM for\n[40:35] a decade or something and it's basically\n[40:37] the same idea. Okay.\n[40:39] >> But you have one screen of two screens.\n[40:42] >> Well, I have like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.\n[40:44] >> No, I mean on your lap. So, it's a\n[40:45] laptop with one. I have like\n[40:47] >> two screens. So, for me, it took a while\n[40:49] to get used to like moving the window.\n[40:51] >> But, but you're on your Mac OS machine\n[40:53] right now, aren't you?\n[40:54] >> Yeah. Yeah, I'm on the Mac OS, but I\n[40:55] installed it on my desktop with like\n[40:57] dual monitors. On my MacBook, I have\n[40:58] three I have my MacBook plus two\n[41:00] screens.\n[41:01] >> Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I'm I'm\n[41:02] still loving my M1 Mac Pro. I don't see\n[41:05] myself changing but but my but my backup\n[41:08] machine is a Marchi so I'm I'm pretty\n[41:10] pleased with that okay when I like I've\n[41:13] worked at a few startups like okay let\n[41:16] like sometimes like okay let I'm I'm\n[41:18] being very facitious here but like like\n[41:21] for example I'm working at go back in\n[41:24] the day and they're product owners that\n[41:27] get assigned to a product and and like\n[41:28] I'm just thinking to myself like what\n[41:30] are their qualifications\n[41:32] like how did this person become a\n[41:34] product owner owner. This person doesn't\n[41:36] know how to code or is not very very\n[41:39] specifically but but somehow they're in\n[41:41] charge of this uh this product to do\n[41:45] this thing and I'm like\n[41:48] >> I think product owners\n[41:50] it seems like like an MBA middle manager\n[41:53] and that's that was the qualification\n[41:56] >> but surely an MBA middle manager product\n[41:59] owner is not going to fly today.\n[42:01] >> Yeah. But I I known product owners that\n[42:03] are very good and and you know they're\n[42:05] focused on user stories and focused also\n[42:08] on deliverables and um they do you know\n[42:13] with together with UX and the graphic\n[42:14] design designers and there's that's a\n[42:18] complex job but definitely that's where\n[42:21] I'm also like when I'm doing my full\n[42:23] stack stuff for fun I'm like yeah I'm\n[42:26] obviously not a UX expert and I'm scared\n[42:30] like I need to get those thing under\n[42:32] under control because I need I feel like\n[42:35] I can direct\n[42:36] >> the typical product owner doesn't isn't\n[42:38] a UI expert either right\n[42:41] >> the so and a colleague uh some time back\n[42:46] told me that to be a middle manager\n[42:49] anyone can be he told me like anyone\n[42:51] could be a middle manager all you need\n[42:52] to be is organized\n[42:56] is it correct to say that um AI helps\n[43:00] you keep organized this Cuz that's the\n[43:01] way I think about it.\n[43:03] >> I think you need to I think when when\n[43:05] you use AI, you need to be even more\n[43:07] organized because AI goes on the tangent\n[43:09] with you if you don't pay attention.\n[43:13] >> I see.\n[43:14] >> I think you need to really know like\n[43:15] hold on a minute. This is high priority.\n[43:18] Yes. Yes. AI can tell you this high\n[43:19] priority, but it's only going off on\n[43:21] what you make it feel like. If you feel\n[43:23] that is not a high priority, you will,\n[43:25] you know, AI will quickly adjust and go,\n[43:27] you're absolutely right.\n[43:29] >> Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're\n[43:30] right. You It's I guess this goes back\n[43:34] to people who have experience. The\n[43:36] people the people that have a taste or\n[43:39] or know the the different rabbit holes\n[43:42] that you can run into, the people that\n[43:44] know how to get to a deliverable are\n[43:48] better disposed to work with AI.\n[43:51] >> I think so. Yeah. people that are able\n[43:53] to keep the goal their eyes on the on\n[43:55] the target and and scope down and\n[43:58] identify this is good for an MVP. I need\n[44:01] to get this in front of users quickly\n[44:03] and and able to\n[44:04] >> I guess I was trying to paint a picture\n[44:06] that that us engineers would be a better\n[44:09] fit for the product owner. We were\n[44:10] hoping for it but I'm not sure given the\n[44:13] examples I gave you earlier as well like\n[44:15] an engineer exposes explores these this\n[44:18] working like collaborative working of\n[44:19] engine of agents using git and what he\n[44:22] knows but somebody coming like from a\n[44:24] completely different background just\n[44:26] things like well we're orchestrating\n[44:28] things that communicate at the lightning\n[44:31] speed it's not like humans need to wait\n[44:33] for each other and are busy and are\n[44:35] sleeping you know they can easily\n[44:37] coordinate file system and and you know\n[44:40] tweet a few turns and\n[44:41] >> yeah, but a product a product owner is\n[44:42] not going to come up with that Ralph\n[44:45] Wigum approach is is he he or she\n[44:49] well\n[44:51] >> well apparently it was product owners\n[44:53] and it was a dude that is a a quant\n[44:56] trainer uh you know high frequency\n[44:59] trader\n[45:00] >> that that came up with these systems. I\n[45:01] guess I'm biased to think how engineers\n[45:04] are going to scale up, but I'm also\n[45:07] >> Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to figure\n[45:09] out in my brain is like I think I think\n[45:11] I know where I need to go, but but where\n[45:14] do the existing people need to go too\n[45:17] also? Like I I guess all these skills\n[45:21] that we're learning are accessible to\n[45:22] anyone really. Yeah, it's just a matter\n[45:25] of who is passive to reinvent themsel\n[45:27] and who can, you know, because this is\n[45:30] one thread I saw on on on Twitter now. I\n[45:32] used to say always say I saw it on\n[45:34] Reddit. Now I start to say I saw it on\n[45:35] Twitter. Um which is like\n[45:38] >> some people they're just doing their 9\n[45:40] to5. They have their family life. They\n[45:41] have no time to explore this. And then\n[45:43] you have other people\n[45:44] >> that have nothing but time. Maybe\n[45:46] they're unemployed or they're just like\n[45:48] Steve addicted to to these things and\n[45:52] they're just uh you know Steve Jay was\n[45:54] saying I'm running cloud code while I'm\n[45:56] driving like it's it's on my laptop in\n[45:58] my car and and like I'm on it all the\n[46:01] time and um\n[46:03] >> yeah people investing their time. Yeah,\n[46:04] I guess it's all about that people\n[46:06] investing time.\n[46:07] >> He said I had 1 million and this is\n[46:09] another thing they say right? You need\n[46:10] to get in the reps. you need to be like\n[46:11] you need to exercise and it becomes a\n[46:13] body to to muscle like mind to body uh\n[46:16] connection but when you're on the topic\n[46:19] because everyone is going off uh and\n[46:21] misrepresenting this tweet from this\n[46:23] Google engineer principal engineer at\n[46:25] Google uh Jana Doan or Rakil who build\n[46:28] >> Yeah Raquel yeah yeah I I love that lady\n[46:31] she's written some great stuff\n[46:33] >> load testers and stuff in\n[46:34] >> yeah it's one of my favorite tools\n[46:36] >> yeah I also use it so she said that they\n[46:39] spent several years as a team\n[46:42] um building.\n[46:44] >> Oh, do you have the tweet?\n[46:46] >> Did she still have it on her account?\n[46:48] She might have removed it cuz I think\n[46:50] many people just jumped on it and said\n[46:51] like you see AGI is here because\n[46:55] um you know Cloud Code was able to do it\n[46:58] in a week what they spent years to do.\n[47:00] Yeah, this is that's the one, right? I'm\n[47:03] not joking and this isn't funny.\n[47:05] >> Yeah, I I I hate it.\n[47:08] This person screenshotted her like what\n[47:11] is that because she removed it?\n[47:13] >> I think she might. Well, the my my\n[47:17] takeaway of what she said was that was\n[47:19] that uh was that well Claude was is good\n[47:23] a and b uh that like\n[47:29] that that Claude was was able to make a\n[47:32] breakthrough because like let's be\n[47:34] honest like when you have a team when\n[47:35] you have a team of like three or let's\n[47:38] say five let's say if you have a team of\n[47:39] five actually good people\n[47:43] >> it's it's quite a struggle to build\n[47:44] something because the five people might\n[47:46] be pulling in different directions. But\n[47:48] when you but when you give a task like\n[47:49] build an orchestrator to to claude 5 4.5\n[47:53] and then out pops a a product and you\n[47:56] know 10 minutes later you're like\n[47:58] wondering what the hell's going on now.\n[48:01] >> This is like a classic case of Captain\n[48:03] Hindsight like you know\n[48:06] >> Captain Hindsight.\n[48:08] >> You know Captain Hindsight from South\n[48:09] Park?\n[48:10] >> No. No I don't actually.\n[48:14] He comes to a burning building and\n[48:15] people are screaming and they're like,\n[48:17] \"Save us, Captain Hindsight.\" And say,\n[48:19] \"That building is built too close to the\n[48:21] other building and there should be a\n[48:22] fire exit there. You're welcome.\" And he\n[48:24] goes away. Like\n[48:27] anyway, um it's like they spent years\n[48:30] designing this and iterating through\n[48:32] different versions. and she approached\n[48:34] cloud and you prompted it just an\n[48:37] indicator that an expert with experience\n[48:39] into certain systems and knowing the\n[48:41] trade-offs is able to build something\n[48:43] like within 5 days with it, but it\n[48:45] doesn't represent all of the, you know,\n[48:49] mistakes that they made along the way\n[48:50] and all of the retries they had to do\n[48:52] and the different iterations that went\n[48:54] through.\n[48:54] >> So, it would have taken a lot longer.\n[48:56] But reality is yes. I mean you can you\n[48:58] can definitely take an idea and iterate\n[49:01] and and then or build an MVP and try it\n[49:04] out and then realize all the problems\n[49:06] that you have with it and then quickly\n[49:08] throw it away and and and step back and\n[49:09] do another one. Uh which is what what\n[49:11] Steve Jie said when he was building\n[49:13] Gastown, right? He did the Python\n[49:14] version then did the Golang version and\n[49:16] and he says like he basically spun it up\n[49:19] looked at the agents what they were\n[49:21] trying to do and then because he has\n[49:24] this idea like we talked about last time\n[49:25] you you built the the flags and the\n[49:28] commands that the agents are trying like\n[49:29] they hey here's beats issue tracker\n[49:31] create an issue and it goes like okay bd\n[49:34] create and in an error it's create d-\n[49:37] description oh the description should be\n[49:39] a positional argument instead of a flag\n[49:41] you know so he makes the the tool to\n[49:43] behave like like the agents and then\n[49:45] when he was building gas town he tries\n[49:47] it. The agents are like struggling. He\n[49:49] he kills it. He just looks at what they\n[49:51] did and then he builds those flags and\n[49:52] those commands. They said it took like\n[49:54] three four iterations and finally the\n[49:57] agents were like intuitively picking\n[49:58] everything up and started to just turn\n[50:00] code out on their own. That's when I\n[50:01] knew I had it. That's when I knew it was\n[50:03] ready to go. And since then it's been\n[50:04] running and he has like received 30\n[50:06] different uh pull requests and like it's\n[50:08] barely four days and he says it's taken\n[50:10] taking off like crazy. This thing is\n[50:12] going on its own. And another really\n[50:14] cool uh observation he made was that\n[50:18] beats was launched in October. It wasn't\n[50:21] part of the training corpus of LLMs. Yet\n[50:23] they were very good at using it. But\n[50:25] what else is happening is all of these\n[50:28] LLMs get retrained with the new updated\n[50:30] data and they will be intuitive on\n[50:32] beats. They will be trained on beats.\n[50:35] >> They will know how to use it and they\n[50:37] will know how to use Gasttown. So it's\n[50:38] only going to get better. they're only\n[50:39] going to get more intuitive with Gaston\n[50:41] is what he said. And I thought that was\n[50:42] a really cool um takeaway as well. It's\n[50:45] basically, you know, the what they call\n[50:47] it pointing.\n[50:49] >> That's one thing that I found quite\n[50:50] frustrating with the skills because I\n[50:52] wrote a skill to help me like\n[50:55] I wrote a skill to help me um to use uh\n[50:59] the GitHub CLI for example, right? Like\n[51:02] this one here. Like if I give you this\n[51:05] URL then you can view it and you can for\n[51:11] some reason that I need to put the ch\n[51:13] override the GH pager otherwise when you\n[51:15] when you run when when you run GitHub\n[51:17] run ls it just stops you know what I\n[51:20] mean you have to press Q to to to get\n[51:23] out of it\n[51:24] >> it blocks I don't know why the GitHub\n[51:26] CLI works that way\n[51:28] >> but you don't have you have to do that\n[51:30] in your in your terminal but if you do\n[51:31] if you go in in cloud and you do execute\n[51:34] ter uh shell you will don't have to do\n[51:36] it because the pager in in cloud is not\n[51:38] set like the TTY is different.\n[51:41] >> Yeah. Yeah. But like in VS code um it\n[51:44] runs it in the terminal and the page is\n[51:46] the same as your terminal and it gets\n[51:47] stuck.\n[51:48] >> Really cloud code did not get stuck for\n[51:50] me.\n[51:50] >> Yeah. But I understand the cloud code\n[51:52] wouldn't because it has a different uh\n[51:55] environment. But the the way that VS\n[51:57] Code works slightly different. But\n[51:59] anyway, what I'm trying to say here is\n[52:01] that um I wrote this and then I did a\n[52:04] test like do the thing like here's the\n[52:07] thing\n[52:09] >> with with the skill and then or or\n[52:11] without the skill then with the skill\n[52:12] and see if if the skill actually was\n[52:14] used and did it actually even work. And\n[52:17] the funny thing was is that it was kind\n[52:19] of helpful for um for for uh\n[52:24] >> until you hit 40% context remain\n[52:26] >> for for for OpenAI for for basically\n[52:29] dumb models. But Claude 4.5 knew how to\n[52:32] run GH CLI without even uh me telling it\n[52:37] to do it\n[52:38] >> right. Yeah.\n[52:39] >> So it's like what you said with beads.\n[52:41] It's like we're getting to a stage where\n[52:42] like the models are trained to do these\n[52:45] things to to get these new skills and\n[52:47] then you and then it gets to a point\n[52:49] then like why is that skill even there?\n[52:52] It's just it's just polluting the\n[52:53] context, right? Because now the model\n[52:56] even knows how to do this and I don't\n[52:58] even have to tell it to do this.\n[53:00] >> Yeah, it's a bit it's a bit subtler I\n[53:03] think because I think\n[53:05] but it's it's right. I mean ultimately\n[53:10] it just directs in a way we don't\n[53:12] understand how these things work right I\n[53:14] mean it there's just like terabytes of\n[53:16] data going into\n[53:19] layers of of of what do they call it\n[53:22] >> inference models or whatever\n[53:25] >> it's more like neural neural networks\n[53:27] yeah yeah but I I do I do things that\n[53:30] that I there's one step that I ask it to\n[53:33] do which I don't think it does\n[53:35] automatically\n[53:38] And that is to check\n[53:40] I mean the whole the whole GitHub CLI\n[53:42] experience is insane. They sort of hide\n[53:45] the the commit for some bizarre reason\n[53:47] in the CLI.\n[53:49] >> So basically I tell it to like please\n[53:52] check what the commit was and make sure\n[53:54] it's same as the one that's local.\n[53:56] Otherwise we know we're getting off to a\n[53:57] bad start.\n[53:59] >> Right. Nice. Yeah. This is a type of\n[54:02] like small little details that you\n[54:03] wouldn't get in a training corpus,\n[54:05] right? That is like\n[54:07] >> yeah,\n[54:07] >> you know, if you're trying to do this\n[54:09] task, there's this little um catch that\n[54:12] you need to watch out for that that you\n[54:14] need to that the skill really is useful\n[54:16] for. But even then, like I feel that\n[54:18] these skills are they say that if you\n[54:20] hit 40% context window remaining, then\n[54:23] the model models turn into dumb. It's\n[54:27] time to cut. Like the moment I see I'm\n[54:29] I'm the task is complete. And if it's\n[54:31] like 45% I'm like okay time for the\n[54:34] handover you know don't try to tackle\n[54:37] anything else. Uh because they will\n[54:39] start doing these things where even\n[54:40] though I have like the skill and I have\n[54:42] it repeated in my initial prompt on the\n[54:45] session plus there's a skill plus I have\n[54:47] to say it again and yet it still doesn't\n[54:49] do it sometimes. It's like okay\n[54:51] >> yeah that's\n[54:53] that's we've talked about it before but\n[54:56] I I see it a lot online. And it's like\n[54:58] yeah I've I've given the skill I've\n[55:00] given the claw MD but it doesn't\n[55:02] actually do what I asked it to do.\n[55:05] So there's so so from so so from from\n[55:08] both angles we have a problem here like\n[55:10] we we have models are improving so that\n[55:13] you don't even need the skill and then\n[55:15] the other side that when you even write\n[55:18] the skill it doesn't take it on\n[55:22] some do better than others. It also\n[55:23] depends on what sort of need in the\n[55:25] context. This is one thing that I\n[55:26] realized very weird. I was working on a\n[55:29] a project and I had like broken down the\n[55:32] tasks. Um and\n[55:36] and this is one of the things I talk\n[55:37] about why Ralph Wiggum is good because\n[55:40] normally you will break down the task\n[55:41] and you will um you will create a big\n[55:44] plan of this then that right do this\n[55:47] then do this then do this. But then if\n[55:48] you need to adjust course adjust in the\n[55:50] middle you're kind of like oh where does\n[55:52] that go? and and if you have like a long\n[55:54] list of tasks, it's a bit harder to\n[55:56] readjust everything. Um, but what I was\n[56:00] trying to say is that\n[56:03] for some reason I had a very big task\n[56:05] list with very clear specifications on\n[56:08] each task and I had never told it to do\n[56:11] something. Um, and for some reason one\n[56:14] of the previous hand session handoffs,\n[56:17] maybe Opus decided to add this little\n[56:19] helpful example code snippet, but it\n[56:22] doesn't match at all my original task\n[56:24] design for the next next task. It says\n[56:27] do this. And so I I kicked off open\n[56:29] code. It was one of the first times I\n[56:30] used open code and codeex in open code\n[56:32] and it started to do this completely\n[56:34] different thing. And I was like, hold on\n[56:35] a minute. I never told it to do that.\n[56:36] And I went, where does it come from? I\n[56:38] started blaming open code from not\n[56:40] reading the task properly. And then I\n[56:42] noticed it was in the session handle\n[56:43] from Opus. I was like, where did Opus\n[56:45] get that from? And then when I I I\n[56:47] removed it. I I get reset the whole\n[56:49] tree, got rid of everything that open\n[56:51] code has done because I didn't want\n[56:52] that. It was one very early little code\n[56:54] snippet and I removed that little\n[56:57] snippet that Opus added for fun and\n[56:59] suddenly it worked perfectly exactly as\n[57:01] as planned. So this can be frustrating\n[57:03] if you don't pay attention. Yeah,\n[57:05] >> I think like at the context degradation,\n[57:09] >> for some reason it didn't follow the pre\n[57:11] pre-existing research and thought it\n[57:13] might be helpful and and and a little\n[57:15] bit like do a little bit extra\n[57:16] sometimes, right?\n[57:17] >> Well, I guess going back to the whole\n[57:18] product owner versus engineer, I think I\n[57:20] think engineers are a little bit more\n[57:22] detail orientated, right? We we would\n[57:25] probably catch that.\n[57:27] >> I don't know. I I can't say those things\n[57:29] because there's so many different\n[57:32] engineers and owners product. I can't\n[57:34] say again like I said it's the people\n[57:35] that are able to reinvent themselves\n[57:37] either they're an engineer or a product\n[57:39] owner and they're able to to to get the\n[57:41] reps in and to explore and they're\n[57:44] curious and they keep going at it even\n[57:46] if it's not the perfect\n[57:49] >> you are right I agree\n[57:51] >> it's not because somebody decided to be\n[57:53] owner\n[57:54] >> why does\n[57:54] >> one day\n[57:56] >> why the hell doesn't any of Steve Jger's\n[58:00] >> has to pass\n[58:01] >> oh no it does pass it I needed a BD in\n[58:04] it.\n[58:05] >> Oh, so you needed a SQL database\n[58:08] >> and then it worked.\n[58:09] >> I mean, this is for gas town.\n[58:12] >> Uh,\n[58:13] >> I mean, did it? Yeah,\n[58:19] >> now it's running the cache, right?\n[58:21] >> Because go test by default, we know.\n[58:23] >> How do you make it not dash count on the\n[58:27] if you go to the make file? So cloud\n[58:30] always says it's actually dangerous when\n[58:32] you use cloud because um\n[58:34] >> like how do I make it do a non-cash one?\n[58:36] Uh\n[58:36] >> dash count\n[58:38] >> dash count.\n[58:39] >> Yeah, dash count one space one. That's\n[58:43] what cloud always does.\n[58:45] >> What does that work?\n[58:49] >> What? How is that intuitive?\n[58:52] >> It's about the parallelism of the task\n[58:54] or something. If you do it again, I I\n[58:56] don't remember exactly, but when when\n[58:59] you were\n[58:59] >> it's gonna be cached.\n[59:01] >> Nope.\n[59:02] >> What?\n[59:02] >> Cash breaks\n[59:04] >> just by doing count one.\n[59:07] >> Yeah, there I remember why at some\n[59:08] point, but at this point, I don't care\n[59:10] anymore cuz like when I see this and I\n[59:12] ask cloud, it just says it just at the\n[59:14] count. And like the first time I was\n[59:15] like, heck, why? Now I'm like, yeah,\n[59:17] whatever. You're right.\n[59:19] Does it does it do what I expect? Oh,\n[59:21] yes it does. Okay. I I uh I have to go\n[59:25] now.\n[59:25] >> Okay. Okay. Oh, generated by claw code.\n[59:28] Generated by claw code. Interesting.\n[59:30] >> But look at who. It was Gus. It was\n[59:33] Jack.\n[59:34] >> Who are these people?\n[59:36] >> Author Kiru, Gus. These are the\n[59:38] different pcats in G in in in Gast Town.\n[59:42] Oh,\n[59:43] >> Jack, Gus,\n[59:45] >> George, Max,\n[59:49] >> Dave,\n[59:51] and then there's Deacon. And then\n[59:53] there's\n[59:54] >> Black Finger.\n[59:59] >> Wow, man. I got to have a closer look at\n[1:00:01] this. Okay, thanks for the chat. I think\n[1:00:03] that was good stuff. See you.

Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 69,843 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line.

Ralph Wigan number one on the\nagenda.\n>> Well, you put it number one. Don't act\nsurprised. You expected me to bump it\ndown.\n>> Well, to be honest, I wanted to put it\nlike\nsecond to uh you demoing the the thing\nthat you're trying to demo to me\n>> cuz you're afraid we're going to run out\nof time.\n>> Oh my god, there's a lot to cover and I\nneed to basically take my kids off in 10\nminutes. But like maybe\n>> you call me 10 minutes before you go and\nthen\n>> I don't know if you like like if you had\n10 minutes and you wanted to talk about\nsomething what you want to talk about\nyou choose\n>> the memes around Ralph Wigum.\nI like him.\n>> What what is Ralph Wigum?\n>> Okay. So I saw a very niceation\n>> where Ralph Wigum is a Simpson\ncharacter. the guy who sits on the train\nin the class and that ate the crayons\nand the very famous meme where he's on\nthe bus and the bus is about to crash\nand he goes like I'm in danger. It's\nlike it's it's a classic character like\na clueless character. Um, and so it's\nkind of fitting for the fact that you\njust put it in put cloud in a loop. And\nI like it um because one of the\nbreakdowns of why it is successful\nis basically\nit just means that um\nthat the models have become so good.\nI I thought putting them in a loop was\npretty much what Gast Town was doing\nwith a little bit of coordination.\n>> No, no, no. Gast Town. So I I like the\nsecond blog post that that Steve Jger g\ndid, which is way more the background\nthan how it came to be what it is. I\nthink that's a gentle introduction to\nGast Town. So he has the original\nannouncement. Here's Gast Town. Cost\n$600 a month to run it. It's crazy.\nDon't do it. Caveat. Watch out. And um\nand then he did a second and with a full\nbreakdown. It's very hard to follow\nbecause it's like introducing all of\nthese different concepts but using you\nknow names that don't make sense like\nbcats and and uh scrapyard and towns and\nthe way that towns communicate. I still\ndon't understand the difference between\nlike why can't you just say agents are\nmailing each other? No, we have to see\nbullot bulls live.\n>> I think I I often think to myself that\nuh in our industry terminology is\nactually\na big part of what we do, right? Using\nthe right words is the right and and AI\nagents\n>> is already kind of overloaded as\n>> sensitive to words. Oh, it's\n>> I mean like agents I' I've seen if you\nlike I don't know if you go along on\nYouTube and you and you like some people\nhave like weird ideas what agents are. I\nthink and like if if if you define it if\nyou call your agent PCAT and you define\nwhat PCA does exactly and what where it\nlives exactly and how it works exactly.\nI think\n>> it's very hard because then you're\nintroducing all these new concepts and\nthey don't have any relationship. But\nthat's what a a new a new idea a\ngroundbreaking idea will probably end up\ndoing, right? We'll invent three new\nwords in the process.\n>> So this is why I I'm I'm defending Steve\nin his in his crazy naming.\n>> Yeah. But I have a history here of\ncoming into an organization as a DevOps\nengineer and being told to de deploy\nOkali and having to scram cuz first off\nyou weren't involved in the original\ndesign of Okali. You have no idea what\nOkalai is supposed to be. Then you have\nto find\n>> So okali are the what you call the\nfacets of the eyes of a bee and it was\nbasically the optic uh character\nrecognition engine for scanning receipts\nat the supermarket at the team that I\nwas working at. So you see how annoying\nit is. Uh and then another thing that's\nvery annoying. Yes, naming is is is is\ndifficult, but for me it was like just\ntell me that you want the OCR scanner\nmicroser deployed, right? Don't tell me\nI have to go and figure out what OKAI is\n>> at the same time. All these calls and\nall this nonsense,\n>> but at the same time\n>> Yeah, but that that's kind of different.\nI mean, that's like a project name as\nopposed to But yeah, I get I get I get\nwhat you're saying. It can be it can\nwork the other way very easily.\nYeah, I mean it makes sense I guess if\nyou if they are in in a in the nom\nnomature like it was an or an an\norganization called Honorsby. So it was\nOkalai and Beehive and Beehive was a\nproduct catalog but you know\n>> Oh god no.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But you know you cringe the\nmoment I say this. I cringe the moment I\nread like Paul Catz and all and then he\nsays to avoid copyright he mixes Mad Max\nterminology with others uh to make sure\nthat like no single um enterprise can go\nafter you know him for copyright claims\nor trademarks. He said, \"No wonder.\" And\nno one. Anyway, what I was trying to say\nis, and we were getting back to Ralph\nWiggum, is that\nthe second article is way better because\nhe really explains um exactly how and\nhow many iterations he went because he\ncreate original vibe coder and then he\ncreated VC and then he created a Python\nversion of Gastown. He had a couple of\nworkshops.\nUh I think it's the second one there.\nYeah. And then he did the Golang version\nof Gaston and he he kind of explains his\nexperiences using Python versus Golang\nand um you know what worked, what didn't\nwork and like he went to through three\nor four iterations of um Gaston.\nSo\nit's a very good I like this one. It's a\nway more gentler introduction to how it\ncame to be what it is. Um but it is a\nvery interesting way and is a very\ninteresting\nyou know group of people are approaching\nagent orchestration by building it in a\nnon-engineering\nway. For example, is it better to create\ngit work trees and let every agent work\nin an isolated work like git branch and\nthen deal with the branch conflicts like\nmerge conflicts or and that's another\napproach. Is it better to all let them\nall like let's say you're in three or\nfour agents at the same time on the same\nfile system and give them a way to\ncommunicate with each other and reserve\nfiles so that they don't create these\nconflicts at in the first place. And as\nan engineer,\n>> yeah, blocking a folder or something.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. So, as an engineer, you come with\na long background of like git and\nversioning and collaboration that takes\nseveral days and you know this type of\nworkflow, whereas these agents work at a\nvery different like speed and have a\nmuch better way of coordinating than us.\nSo, approaching it from a non-engineer\nperspective, which is what um this guy,\nI forgot his name now on Twitter. He\nbuilt the the mail system that Gasttown\nuses. So basically this male MCP for\nagents to communicate is all coming from\nnon-engineers looking at this O AI um\nhype from a completely different angle\nlike a non-engineering angle and I\nthought that was very interesting to\nread and I think Ralph Wigum is also an\napproach to that right stop trying to\nbuild too many processes around these\nagents and give them a very simple loop.\nSo have you have you tried it? Actually\nI can relax now since um the school is\nnot opening in is delayed opening for 1\nhour.\n>> Oh because people were stuck.\n>> We got time.\nSo that's good.\nSo yeah. Have you have you tried well\nthis uh approach then?\nNo, but I think the the one of the\nbreakdowns for it I thought was very\ninteresting breakdown because I think I\njust I'm repeating myself. Sorry, I'm\ndistracted. Because it identifies that\nthe models have just become so much\nbetter. And also I feel that kind of\nreflects us as we are like you know this\ndidn't work but I finally found\nsomething that worked and and and this\nworks 100%. I tried so many and it\ndidn't work but guess what?\n>> Maybe it doesn't work because you found\nthe right way of doing it. Maybe it just\nworks so much better.\n>> Personally, personally, I I thought AI\nwas was was interesting, but then when\nClaude 4.5 came along, I thought to\nmyself, \"Holy moly.\" Yeah. So many\npeople now because I I avoided X for a\nlong time and but it used to be a very\ngood source of news, but you were\nsharing me some threads and then I\ndecided to just start going through this\nand and the\n>> onex you mean.\n>> Yeah. If you subscribe, if you follow\nthe right people, then it's insane. Like\nthe amount of\n>> Yeah, that that tab is insane. But if\nyou\n>> and the amount of people going like I\njust spent two weeks during the holidays\nwith Opus with the double limits and I'm\nsold. I'm sold. That's it.\n>> I'm sold. I I I I enjoyed uh the\nanthropic posts on on X like the the the\nuh advent calendar and the that Boris\nguy is also really good that the the the\nwhat's his name?\nGod searching on uh the guy that that\ninvented Corker or\nhe he's great. Yeah. is I don't know if\nyou follow him, but he's he's posting\n>> Boris. Yeah, because he people ask\nthings and he he replies to them and he\ntalks about his his his workflow,\n>> but then he also replies, \"Oh, just do\nthis.\" Or he says, \"Yeah, that's a great\nidea. Let me let me add that and we'll\nadd it to the backlog.\"\n>> Yeah. Yeah. There was an epic one where\nsomeone suggested something and then he\nreleased it in 20 minutes.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> and also that he says that he's what\nmerging 100 PRs and he has like\n>> six um parallel agents and the way he\nswitches between his mobile and his his\n>> I I I have I'm using my wife's\nsubscription\nbecause I have API subscription through\nwork and I just don't want to mix it all\nup. So the the the the thing that\nconfuses me or the thing that I want to\ndo, the workflow that I want to do is\nthat like I I have my clawed stuff or I\nhave my agents doing something, but say\nI pop out to go fetch my kids and or I'm\nin the supermarket. It would be nice to\nto go on the Claude app and basically\nsee how those agents are doing, but but\nright now there's no link between Claude\ncode u sessions and and the and the app.\nAnd I thought he was alluding to the\nfact that that this might be possible\nbecause he said, you know, there's a\ncommand in the cloud co\nand uh but it but it doesn't actually do\nanything.\n>> Yeah. There was another very cool one.\nUm, people are more and more saying like\nI need my laptop like my cloud code on\nmy laptop because it has everything\ninstalled. And Boris, I don't know how\nhe does it, but he must I don't know\nmaybe he has a custom sandbox internally\nwithin Antropic that has all the tools\nthat has more than what we get when\nwe're on the web. But\n>> we get like if you use cloud code on the\nweb, there's a lot of restrictions on it\nobviously because they don't want people\nto start running crypto miners.\nAnd so basically he um somebody says\nwhat if I can just like run a T-max um\nfrom my laptop or like a reverse tunnel,\nyou know, like Angro and have that\nexposed through the web so that I can\njust be on my mobile.\n>> This this might help you. Bars, help me.\nI hit my weekly limit slash extra usage.\nYeah. You know what that is?\n>> It just starts using your it starts\nusing your wallet with the API costs.\n>> So like you you use you pay $20 a month.\nYou put $5 or maybe you put $20 in your\nwallet. You you hit the five hour\nsession limit and you go like, you know\nwhat, I would really love Opus to finish\nthis. And you like go like, yes, extra\nusage. And it burns through $20 within\nlike within like an hour. And you go\nlike, what? I just paid $20 a month and\nnow I just burn to another 20 in an\nhour. It's very very painful, but it\ndoes help if you're in a rush.\n>> This is also interesting. Opus 4.5 is\nRalph Wigum and Playright is AGI.\n>> I disagree. Those are people I talked to\none guy and he has like an enterprise\naccess and he says, \"Yeah, I I I burn\nmillions of tokens like like you\nmentioned before. They have thousands of\ndollars.\" Then maybe you can you can use\nPlayright MCP. But if you're on a a\nnormal subscription,\n>> so the last podcast upload.\n>> Yeah.\n>> If um and you can find it on debase.com\npodcast,\n>> the thought that's been jiggling around\nmy mind since we last spoke is is valid.\n>> How do you test and validate stuff?\n>> Yep.\n>> Do you have do you have the solution for\nthat? Because Yeah. Like when I read\nthis um this tweet about\n>> about playright being the agi you were\nsaying to me no you're running play\nright wrong with MCP so so how do you\nrun play right right play right right\nshould be a rapper okay so what is my\nproblem with MCPS and also the problem\nthat both Cloudflare and Antropic have\nhighlighted is that it's a massive token\nwaste that sending all of the characters\nacross on every turn one by one I've hit\nit myself several times. It's very\nfrustrating.\n>> Right. So when you use the playright\nMCP, it will take screenshots which is B\n64 encoded image. So that's the\nsignificant amount of characters. It\nwill take a structural document like\nsome type of YAML representation or an\nXML representation of the whole page.\nIt's not really XML because it's like\nmore of a structure of all of the\nelements. Um it's a it's a strange I\ndon't know this representation. I'm not\na front end engineer, you know, but but\nit takes it some type of of skeleton,\nnot a screenshot, but sometimes of like\nstructure, it also sends that down to\nthe model. Um, and and all of this\ninformation is like so much. But when\nyou use playwright as a as a scripting\nengine, basically you write you write a\nscript, right? you say first go to this\nURL\n>> then click on the login page\n>> then you will be redirected\nautomatically to another page wait for\nthe um username text box to be available\nor element to be available\n>> I have scripts like that myself\n>> but that's a script that is a maybe you\nknow 20 lines and that gets generated by\nthe LLM and sent to playright and it\nexecutes in one go and it may get the\nreading that script\nwastes a ton of tokens in my experience.\n>> Oh, it doesn't. Why would it? What? It\nliterally didn't not I I never wrote\nplayright in my life and I was like I\nwould love to be able to do more of an\nend to end. So maybe I share my screen.\nI don't have\n>> Okay.\n>> Uh\n>> Okay.\nYeah, you got to you got to demonstrate\nthis workflow. I'm very curious. Like\nfor example, could you could you show a\nworkflow where um\n>> not on requests? I can show you what I\nhave.\n>> Okay.\n>> No, but I want to see how you create it.\nLike go to like debase.com\n>> and also\n>> listen to a podcast or something. I mean\nthat's very simple. There's no login\nhere or anything.\n>> Validate that there's a\n>> send me that in advance and I will try\n>> Kim.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Thank you. Thank you uh Abiooft for\ncreating Kalema. I mean I'd be dead if I\ndidn't I mean Mac OS would so suck if it\ndidn't add Kalema. Yeah. All the other\nones you need to pay, right?\n>> Exactly.\n>> Yeah. So, I have like test users, Alice\nuser, platform user, new user with no\ngroups and and I'm validating that these\nusers are not able, you know, to do\nthings. So, it has like\n>> you coded this with the AI, right?\n>> Yeah. I I don't know how to write any of\nthis. I have not written a single letter\nof code in this test.\n>> Okay. Okay. So, so it's 170 lines.\n>> Okay.\n>> Right.\n>> Um\nthe the setup thing\nis the coolest thing because it does the\nE2E setup which um as you can see it\nmakes sure that the containers are\nrunning and then it makes sure that the\nusers like it creates a user by creating\nthe Alice user inside um inside click\nand and creates the test user with\ncertain password\nand and and everything. It also goes\nagainst my API to register the user\nrole. So if if I in kick look I create a\nuser a certain group membership and in\nmy API I create group membership to role\nmapping. So it does both ends. Okay.\nRight. So this playright test. So that's\nlike a UI for running the script.\n>> Yes. So and this is this is gold and uh\nbecause if I\n>> it's amazing I tell you. So once\neverything's up right now the server is\nup and they're listening.\n>> Yeah. and and I can just go for example\nI want to do a successful login and\nsuccession persistence test. So I'm\ngoing to log in and then I'm going to\nrefresh and make sure I'm still logged\nin. Right? So I close the console. The\nthere's nothing here. It did not run.\nWhen I click it and when you trigger\nthem it's going to run them all in\nparallel. This is running in a separate\nChrome browser. So in this case it goes\nto sign in with SSO\nbut clearly it's it failed. Oh no it\ndidn't fail. It didn't fail. Sorry it\npassed. It's green, right? There's some\nerror messages here. 401 unauthorized.\nThat's my API because my web asks um\nlike the login status and you get a 401\nif you're not logged in. So these\nconsole error messages I have to get rid\nof at some point. That's my who am I\nendpoint. Anyway, you can see here it\nran very fast, right? It took 3 seconds.\nSo it navigated.\n>> So what ran in parallel? I didn't quite\nunderstand.\n>> I just ran one. I just ran this one.\n>> But if you run them, you can if I click\nthis one, it's going to run all of\nthese. You can click this one. It's\ngoing to run all of them. And it's going\nto all run in separate headless uh not\nheadless, it's going to run all in\nChrome uh instances separated\nindividually. All run at the same time.\nAll different workers, Chrome workers.\nSo So I just ran one. So it went to the\nwebsite and then it says not\nauthenticated. It clicked on sign in. It\nwas redirected to Keycloak. It entered\nthe test user which was part of the\nbootstrap. It clicked on login. Yeah.\n>> Then it went it was automatically\nredirected to the to the API and it\nwaited for the selector. So this is\nsomething that that you learn.\nOriginally the the LLM did not generate\nany test ID onto the elements inside the\nbrowser. So it look for text like it\nlooks for like the login button and\nthings like that.\n>> But if you then after a while I think\nopen code C codeex or Gemini said you\nknow what would make it really easy if\nyou would add test ID to each of these\nelements. I was like what what is test\nID? I was like, well, you know, if you\nwant to do playright scripts, you just\nadd like little attributes to each of\nthese elements and then\n>> it just it just came up with that in a\ncoding session.\n>> Yeah, I have no idea. Like, again, I\nhave never written playright in my life.\nI have not done this. I'm not a front-\nend engineer. And it just said, let's\nuse a test ID. I was like, okay,\nawesome. Do it.\n>> And so, it waits for the selector\n>> and then it's it\nreloads to make sure that the user is\nstill logged in, right? And then it\nverifies I expect to still be logged in.\nAnd then I guess it opens this uh login\nscreen on the right and it sees I'm\nlogged in and I have a product engineer\nrole because I'm a product engineer\ngroup membership. Right? But what if I\nwant to you know what if I introduce\nfailure, right? So again this did not\ninvolve right now I ran my own make\ntarget but this did not involve any you\nknow back and forth between the LLM and\nthe MCP server directing Chrome anything\nlike that right it was a single script\nand it ran the full thing end to end and\nthen it gets the result it gets the\nconsole it gets the errors at every\nstage you can see exactly what was the\nstate of the web browser at that point\num so if I if I close this then the make\ntarget will finish.\nSo now if I um go and change something\nfor example in my outflow or maybe in my\npage maybe in my web app I will I will\nremove the test ID for example so it\ncan't find the element. So let's go\nunder\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I like this idea testing for\nfailure.\n>> Yeah.\nNo login pace. Is there like test ID?\n>> No. Where is the test ID even? you know\nyour code base inside out.\n>> I haven't touched this. I haven't I\nhaven't touched this for um\nfor like\never. I don't know.\n>> This is when you when you start whipping\nout copilot, please make a failing test.\n>> Yeah, there's some here like it tries to\nit tries to make sure that the edges\nexist between states. And here is the\nlist view. It tries to make sure that a\ncertain um state ID is listed after you\nthis is part of the create. So there's\none test that does that does a create\ncreates a state but my my dashboard is\nsupposed to be read only but I wanted to\ntest permissions so I added the create\nstate button.\nIt's like oh my god I have to remove\nthat. Um even for the notification it\ntries to make sure that there's an error\nmessage. So maybe if I remove the toast\ntest ID, let's say I remove this and\nthen I find the test that looks for\nnotification toast. So let's find that.\n>> Um, it's definitely not in the TSX. It's\ngoing to be in the test scripts, I\nthink.\n>> I think you your\ndidn't work.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, by the way, did you try a marachi?\nYeah, I am using a much I'm using Arch\nby the way, but not here.\n>> But but you but did you try a March?\n>> Yeah, I'm using of course I'm not going\nto use Arch without a March. What kind\nof lunatic do you think I am?\n>> Well, but like I installed it the ISO\nyesterday. I was very impressed.\n>> Yeah,\n>> I've got it on my on my uh my ThinkPad.\n>> Just don't run the like screen saver\nbecause it crashed constantly and it\nkills Hyperland. Okay. So, you're using\nOmari,\nof course.\n>> Yeah. So, there's this thing checks for\na success notification. So, there's some\nuh here verify state created looks for a\nsuccess notification which looks for uh\nlocates ro alert. No, that's not what I\nwant. I want to know the one that has\nlike\ntoast notification. So, it added the\ntest IDs, but it's not using them.\nNice. Uh,\n>> yeah. So,\n>> I'm sure it's using it. So, here it's\nusing them here. Let's look for those.\nIt used for out profile button. So, let\nme remove the out profile button. So,\nlet me let me remove the test ID. So, it\ncan't find that anymore. And then it\nwill fail the test because it's not\nthere. Right. Let's look for\n>> call it button two or something. I don't\nknow why you want to do this.\n>> Yeah. So what I wanted to get out of\nthis conversation is that I wanted to\nknow that there's some a good way of\ntesting\nuh an AI generated product and making\nsure that it's consistent and doesn't\nbreak for users and things like that.\nOkay, let's run it again. The So this\nhelper is the\nthis is the login via keycloak. So it's\ngoing to fail the login via K clock\nbecause I I removed it. So the first\nthing one that we did should fail this\ntime and we should get like a clear\nerror message of why it failed\n>> and where and where where in the code\n>> and you get an LLM prompt also from from\nplayright\n>> which is the craziest part.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Huh? What\n>> you get an LLM prompt. It's going to say\nit failed on this step. Here's your LLM\nprompt to find it. Find the fix.\n>> Is this part of playright already? This\nis part of play, right?\n>> This is why I'm like whoever like I try\nto find online resources. Every single\none is about the MCP. I'm like why is\nnobody talking about this this awesome\nfeatures that are in in playright that\nare like way better than the stupid MCP.\nSo okay, let's close the console again.\n>> Yeah, the\n>> this one should fail now. It should\n>> a lot of people have gone off the ball\nwith MCP.\n>> Yeah, expect to be visit. Wait, wait,\nwait.\nIt's probably going to time out, right?\n>> Kaboom.\n>> May maybe I need to build my web app\nagain. No, it failed. It errors, right?\n>> Yeah,\n>> it failed here.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Here it says expect locator to be\nvisible failed.\n>> Yeah,\n>> it says locator here and then copy\nprompt.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> And you go into your code and you go\ninto cloud and you say, \"Hey, um, well,\ndon't use this prompt because it's going\nto\n>> That's the biggest prompt I've ever seen\nin my life. It's like 20 pages. How many\nlines of code is that?\"\n>> But it's everything that you would It's\nIt's a lot shorter.\n>> Just scroll just scroll down. Like, how\nhow long is this thing? Just scroll\ndown.\n>> Keep your knickers on.\n>> They're on. Trust me.\n>> 300 lines. Not that much. Come on.\n>> What the hell? That's but that's\namazing. But at the same time,\n>> it's absolutely amazing because it goes\nlike look this is what the page is.\nHere's the YAML. This is the page\nsnapshot. The thing I told you it has\nthis this YAML representation of the\npage. And if I give this if I just give\nthis right now\n>> HTML\n>> it 100% cloud will go like yo the the\nloc the location button has a two to it.\nIt changed for sure. It will find it in\na sec in an instant.\nNot even going to I'm not giving it\npermission to write. I'm just going to\nlaunch cloud real fast.\nPaste that in.\n>> Probably going to waste $10 on this on\nthis uh\n>> now. I haven't used cloud all day. It's\nfine.\nUse 77% of the commitment.\n>> It's fine. It resets um on the Thursday.\nYeah, it's still enough. 25% for\nWednesday should be enough. One day more\nthan enough.\nOkay, look. It didn't even have to go\nthrough anything like the test expect\nthe element to be like this. But your\nprofile button\num would you like me to read? Yes, read\nit. Let's read. It didn't read. It just\nsaid uh it fails because the it looking\nfor this button. It can't find this\nbutton. So, it hasn't even read the odd\nstate yet, but immediately it's going to\nsay, \"Oh, you have a the test ID\nchange.\"\n>> Okay. Well, I\n>> There you go. It says like there there's\nyour problem. The test ID doesn't match.\n>> Okay. Very good demo. Very good demo.\nVincent,\n>> not not prepared at all. But but but now\ndo you trust me? Because earlier you\nwere like you you did not trust me. You\neven wanted to hang up the\n>> I still think the the creating the these\ntests is is damn expensive. But\num like I'm just thinking like like\nlegacy applications where\n>> that's what I was telling you. I was\ntelling you that none of the\napplications that we've written so far\nhave these things in place. But if you\nif you one thing is with LLMs you can\nactually spend you say it's expensive\nbut how much do you pay for a QA\nengineer? $5,000 a month. How much do\nyou pay for cloud? I pay 30 $30 a month\nand it did all of this for me.\n>> But it's it's also Yeah. I mean\n>> you're right. You're right.\n>> You're right. You're right. You're\nright. It's I actually never thought\nabout the the poor QA engineer who's\ngoing to be threatened by AI. But now\nI'm thinking\n>> but the QA engineer would have saved me\nmoney because I wouldn't have written\nall of the tests without test IDs. It\nwould have immediately thought like hey\nwe need playright we need test IDs. Stop\nthis right.\n>> Well\n>> well I no I'm just thinking aloud that\nthere's no need for a test engine.\nI mean that that job is\n>> now you need to be all right. You need\nto pick it up quickly and you can learn\nquickly from the LLM.\n>> You need to know workflows like you the\none you just showed me. So hopefully\n>> which is why I think\n>> the podcast viewers will will rate the\npodcast or or like it to say that hey I\nlearned something thanks to Vincent's\ndemo right now\n>> which Kai didn't trust. Never going to\nmake that mistake.\n>> A healthy skeptic skepticism.\nOkay. So that that approach shows me\nthat you tested it with playright,\nbut I just c can we have a quick look at\nbeads because that that confuses the\nhell out of\n>> Yeah, go ahead because you had a lot of\nquestions about beats. You took already\nthis screen I guess.\n>> Um no I haven't actually\nscreen\n>> but can you now understand that all of\nthis material maybe it should be the\nfirst dabbase.com blog going about stop\nusing playride mcp and use playrite the\nright way. Why don't why don't you write\na blog? Jesus Christ. It's still\nI need you to I need you to help me out\nhere. I'm dying.\n>> I don't know because Oh, blog on the\nbase or blog. I don't really have you\nhave\n>> you can you can blog on the base. It's\njust do a pull request.\n>> Ah, guest blogs.\n>> Okay. So, here we I'm I'm sharing the\nscreen now. Hopefully, everyone can see\nmy screen. This is beads, baby. Okay.\nOne thing that confuses me is that when\nyou look at the workflow runs, they all\nfail.\nSo that makes me think like, well, what\nhow come they're even failing? Because,\nyou know, they're using AI.\n>> Check the CI. The only way to make sure\nif something is properly tested looking\nat the CI.\n>> Okay. It looks like it's the Golint is\nis failing. But but still,\n>> can you see my screen?\nYeah, probably. I just can't see you. I\ndon't know where you are.\n>> Uhhuh. Whatever. So, I mean, it's a bit\ntrivial here. Like, it's a golden error,\nbut like why didn't like the hook or\nsomething pick that up?\n>> It's been failing for ages. Um, so that\nthat's that's my first question about\nbeads.\n>> No, hold on a minute. I think I Oh, now\nI can see it. Okay,\n>> the next the next thing. Okay, like say\nso say this is release 0.440.\nOkay. So, we should be able to see uh\n>> Oh, you're right. All of the all of the\nG actions are failing.\n>> Yeah,\n>> that's ridiculous.\n>> Yeah. So, like how does he even release\nit when everything's failing? So, it\njust shows me that\n>> that's why I haven't updated for a\nwhile.\n>> But like I mean\n>> that's the question.\n>> Okay. Now, let's have a look at this.\nLike if I go, it's clone it out. You can\nsee my screen, right?\n>> Yes. So, if you go if you go into beads,\nso get tag. Oh my god, this is probably\ngoing to show you how how incompetent I\nam. Where's the latest bloody tag? Okay,\nso this So, if I go get uh switch, I\nthink that should work, shouldn't it?\nUh,\n>> don't\nget check out on the tag directly. Yes.\n>> Um, I think I need to still create a\nbranch, don't I? uh release.\nOkay, so this is 04440\nand I think if if you run scripts tests,\nit should pass, right?\nWell, if the CI is failing,\nthen I would not expect it to pass on a\nmachine that doesn't have any special\nsetup.\n>> To me, the CI is the validation that\n>> you need to say to anyone like\n>> it's a you problem because it works on\nthe machine. So, it's your machine\nproblem. If the if the CI is not\nworking, I cannot say anything.\n>> Yeah. So I I ran I ran scripts test\nessential on a on a main checkout and it\nfailed and I was like what how can this\npossibly be basically so yeah here here\nlook it's failing\n>> in get in in go test it's failing in the\nCI yet he makes a release\nI'm I'm totally confused\ninteresting very interesting\nSteve,\n>> very worrying.\n>> Steve, what the hell are you doing, man?\n>> Wait, he's watches. All of this. All of\nthis.\n>> He what? Of course he watches.\n>> Hey, Steve.\n>> Hey, Boris.\n>> Thanks for tuning in, man.\n>> Hey, Slam, man.\n>> Can we go to the Ralph Wigan memes?\n>> Yeah, let's let's go to the Ralph Wigan\nmemes.\n>> I don't Are you familiar with um with\nInvincible?\nSo the cartoon characters there is in is\nthe Vuvian\nof in\n>> this is a Marvel thing, isn't it?\n>> No, like it's it's like this\nanti-heroes.\nSo, and that's a spoiler for season for\nmaybe the first three episodes of season\none, but\n>> Oh, no. I'm not going to watch this\ncrap.\n>> Yeah. So, so it's a lot of these heroes\ncomic books, they're now like the heroes\nare actually super villains.\n>> Um, like the boys and and Jenv and and\nand Invincible, but but it's pretty\nfunny because\n>> he is this super it's like a play on\nSuperman, but he comes from like\nKrypton,\nplanet Krypton. Um, so he's like a\nSuperman inside Earth and he's they're\nlooking at um airplanes that are flying\nand he's he's telling his son, but he he\nbasically his role is to prepare Earth\nfor takeover. So he's supposed to\ndestroy all of the Earth defenses. Yeah.\n>> So um but his son um is supposed to, you\nknow, follow in his footsteps but\nrefuses. And so he's telling him like,\n\"Look at what they need to mimic a\nfraction of our power because they need\nall of these machines to fly and all,\nbut we we have so much more power.\" And\nand so basically here the GPT 5.2 users\nare making fun of it because I think\nit's very funny a very funny meme\nbecause when you use cloud code, it goes\nvery fast but it makes mistakes, right?\nSo you put it in a loop but if you use\ncodeex or GPD 5.2 two, it goes very\nslow, but it ends up being correct\nbecause it like spends a lot of time\nactually reasoning and making changes.\nIt kind of has the loop built in and and\nand that's kind of a\n>> joke. So, GPT 5.2 already has this kind\nof flow\n>> because, you know, it's so much slower\nand people are like, I hate GPT5 because\nit's so slow. It's not feel doesn't feel\nsnappy. But then on the other side, you\nhave all these cloud users that are so\nsnappy having to put it into a stupid\nloop. Yeah, that's a typical trade-off\nbetween\nspeed and uh\nand uh quality, I suppose. If it's fast\nenough, it doesn't really matter, does\nit? Or\n>> it can pave over the cracks quickly or\nsomething. I\n>> I don't know. It depends on the\ncomplexity of the task, you know, and\nbecause we're so bad at selecting the\nthe models ourselves or the automatic\nselecting doesn't really work well. I'm\nhappy to have a model that is very\nsnappy for most of the things that I\nneed it to do and then when it needs to\ndo a super hard troubleshooting thing\nthat I need to let it loop a bit I'm\nalso okay with it or maybe I just switch\nover myself but I would rather have\nsomething that's always fast than\nsomething like GPT5.\nYeah, I thought it was a funny a funny u\nyou know reference.\n>> Open code became the default on Omari\n>> default\n>> the default. So, Omari ships with CH GPT\nand cloud code and they switched u as a\ndefault CLI agent to open code. So, they\nuse Ghosti already by default and now\nthey made open I mean they just added\nthe package as far as I could tell. But\nyeah, yeah, I'm I'm so impressed with\nOmari. Um\nI'm really impressed.\n>> But the the greatest thing about it is\nOmari DHH is very much focused on um the\nthe theming, right? He he forked\nchromium so just that he could apply the\ntheme\n>> color. I think the theming is a way of\nhook of attracting people. I mean I\nthink I think I think DHH is is next\nlevel. I think he has a very good sense\nof taste. You need that that that polish\nthat that the Linux desktop has been\nmissing. and Amachi with the themes. I I\nknow for for power users it's it's a bit\nof a waste of space, but like I I\nunderstand why he's gone gone that way.\nI I mean the whole the whole install\nprocess. Did you run through this\ninstall process too?\n>> Yeah, just like you have the same\npictures and I posted on Instagram, not\non Twitter.\n>> It's just it's just amazing like like\nwhen you install Windows, it takes you\nlike half a day. This took like this\ntakes three minutes.\n>> He does it on on stage, right? Uh here I\nhad the whole actually when uh let me\nturn off the the\n>> It's so amazing. I If you're not using\nAmarachi, why aren't you using Amarachi?\nIt's amazing.\n>> Yeah.\n>> The the coolest thing is that\n>> he he he's also even solved copy and\npaste. Like copy and paste works really\nwell. The super\n>> So I was like asking CHPT. This was like\nwhen it was booting. Oh yeah, it has the\nwhole uh it's a video basically. What?\n>> Oh my god. This you this. Please stop\nthese handheld videos.\n>> How are you going to make a screen uh\ncapture when it's booting?\n>> Well, you you can get one of these.\n>> You are you have Why did you take a\npicture with your lap phone of your of\nyour\n>> True, but it's at least it's better.\nIt's It's less irritating than a video.\n>> And this one. Stop. I sent you one and\nnow I show you a second.\n>> No. What was your installed? What was\nyour time?\nWhat was your time?\n>> Can you show the time? Uh, 6 minutes and\n20 seconds.\n>> Oh my god, what a loser.\n>> I How come it mine was so slow? It's a\nVietnam internet, dude. I'm not on a\nbackbone. What kind of internet\nconnection do you have?\n>> What? A gigabit?\n>> Yeah. The fact that you have like a IP\nrange tells me you probably pay a\nshitload of money for a backbone\ninternet connection straight a pipe\nstraight to your bedroom.\n>> Yeah. I don't know if you do anything\nlike this, but like what I like to do is\nis I I smoke ping my internet connection\nto like for example S3 endpoints so I\nknow exactly if my S3 endpoint is is uh\nsucking or doing something weird.\n>> Okay. So it's definitely internet\nproblems for me because\n>> Yeah. I mean\n>> because it was you choose to live in a\nthird world country.\n>> Oh, you also did it on a new NVME SSD\nthat you bought, right?\n>> Huh? You als we also just at the same\ntime bought\n>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I installed it on a new\nThis is the same I Well, you Okay. You\nhave this You have the high-end Samsung\none that cost\n>> and it still took 6 minutes and your\nshitty end one it took three minutes.\n>> Well, I got the micron the micron.\nUm yeah, like I'm just quite bullish\nabout Omari and uh the future the I feel\nlike the tiling has been pretty amazing\nmanager,\n>> huh?\n>> The tiling window manager takes a while\nto get used to though.\n>> I mean to be honest, I'm I'm a full\nscreen kind of guy. I I mean I I have my\nmy workspaces 1 2 3 4 5.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean I've been I've been using DWM for\na decade or something and it's basically\nthe same idea. Okay.\n>> But you have one screen of two screens.\n>> Well, I have like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.\n>> No, I mean on your lap. So, it's a\nlaptop with one. I have like\n>> two screens. So, for me, it took a while\nto get used to like moving the window.\n>> But, but you're on your Mac OS machine\nright now, aren't you?\n>> Yeah. Yeah, I'm on the Mac OS, but I\ninstalled it on my desktop with like\ndual monitors. On my MacBook, I have\nthree I have my MacBook plus two\nscreens.\n>> Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I'm I'm\nstill loving my M1 Mac Pro. I don't see\nmyself changing but but my but my backup\nmachine is a Marchi so I'm I'm pretty\npleased with that okay when I like I've\nworked at a few startups like okay let\nlike sometimes like okay let I'm I'm\nbeing very facitious here but like like\nfor example I'm working at go back in\nthe day and they're product owners that\nget assigned to a product and and like\nI'm just thinking to myself like what\nare their qualifications\nlike how did this person become a\nproduct owner owner. This person doesn't\nknow how to code or is not very very\nspecifically but but somehow they're in\ncharge of this uh this product to do\nthis thing and I'm like\n>> I think product owners\nit seems like like an MBA middle manager\nand that's that was the qualification\n>> but surely an MBA middle manager product\nowner is not going to fly today.\n>> Yeah. But I I known product owners that\nare very good and and you know they're\nfocused on user stories and focused also\non deliverables and um they do you know\nwith together with UX and the graphic\ndesign designers and there's that's a\ncomplex job but definitely that's where\nI'm also like when I'm doing my full\nstack stuff for fun I'm like yeah I'm\nobviously not a UX expert and I'm scared\nlike I need to get those thing under\nunder control because I need I feel like\nI can direct\n>> the typical product owner doesn't isn't\na UI expert either right\n>> the so and a colleague uh some time back\ntold me that to be a middle manager\nanyone can be he told me like anyone\ncould be a middle manager all you need\nto be is organized\nis it correct to say that um AI helps\nyou keep organized this Cuz that's the\nway I think about it.\n>> I think you need to I think when when\nyou use AI, you need to be even more\norganized because AI goes on the tangent\nwith you if you don't pay attention.\n>> I see.\n>> I think you need to really know like\nhold on a minute. This is high priority.\nYes. Yes. AI can tell you this high\npriority, but it's only going off on\nwhat you make it feel like. If you feel\nthat is not a high priority, you will,\nyou know, AI will quickly adjust and go,\nyou're absolutely right.\n>> Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're\nright. You It's I guess this goes back\nto people who have experience. The\npeople the people that have a taste or\nor know the the different rabbit holes\nthat you can run into, the people that\nknow how to get to a deliverable are\nbetter disposed to work with AI.\n>> I think so. Yeah. people that are able\nto keep the goal their eyes on the on\nthe target and and scope down and\nidentify this is good for an MVP. I need\nto get this in front of users quickly\nand and able to\n>> I guess I was trying to paint a picture\nthat that us engineers would be a better\nfit for the product owner. We were\nhoping for it but I'm not sure given the\nexamples I gave you earlier as well like\nan engineer exposes explores these this\nworking like collaborative working of\nengine of agents using git and what he\nknows but somebody coming like from a\ncompletely different background just\nthings like well we're orchestrating\nthings that communicate at the lightning\nspeed it's not like humans need to wait\nfor each other and are busy and are\nsleeping you know they can easily\ncoordinate file system and and you know\ntweet a few turns and\n>> yeah, but a product a product owner is\nnot going to come up with that Ralph\nWigum approach is is he he or she\nwell\n>> well apparently it was product owners\nand it was a dude that is a a quant\ntrainer uh you know high frequency\ntrader\n>> that that came up with these systems. I\nguess I'm biased to think how engineers\nare going to scale up, but I'm also\n>> Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to figure\nout in my brain is like I think I think\nI know where I need to go, but but where\ndo the existing people need to go too\nalso? Like I I guess all these skills\nthat we're learning are accessible to\nanyone really. Yeah, it's just a matter\nof who is passive to reinvent themsel\nand who can, you know, because this is\none thread I saw on on on Twitter now. I\nused to say always say I saw it on\nReddit. Now I start to say I saw it on\nTwitter. Um which is like\n>> some people they're just doing their 9\nto5. They have their family life. They\nhave no time to explore this. And then\nyou have other people\n>> that have nothing but time. Maybe\nthey're unemployed or they're just like\nSteve addicted to to these things and\nthey're just uh you know Steve Jay was\nsaying I'm running cloud code while I'm\ndriving like it's it's on my laptop in\nmy car and and like I'm on it all the\ntime and um\n>> yeah people investing their time. Yeah,\nI guess it's all about that people\ninvesting time.\n>> He said I had 1 million and this is\nanother thing they say right? You need\nto get in the reps. you need to be like\nyou need to exercise and it becomes a\nbody to to muscle like mind to body uh\nconnection but when you're on the topic\nbecause everyone is going off uh and\nmisrepresenting this tweet from this\nGoogle engineer principal engineer at\nGoogle uh Jana Doan or Rakil who build\n>> Yeah Raquel yeah yeah I I love that lady\nshe's written some great stuff\n>> load testers and stuff in\n>> yeah it's one of my favorite tools\n>> yeah I also use it so she said that they\nspent several years as a team\num building.\n>> Oh, do you have the tweet?\n>> Did she still have it on her account?\nShe might have removed it cuz I think\nmany people just jumped on it and said\nlike you see AGI is here because\num you know Cloud Code was able to do it\nin a week what they spent years to do.\nYeah, this is that's the one, right? I'm\nnot joking and this isn't funny.\n>> Yeah, I I I hate it.\nThis person screenshotted her like what\nis that because she removed it?\n>> I think she might. Well, the my my\ntakeaway of what she said was that was\nthat uh was that well Claude was is good\na and b uh that like\nthat that Claude was was able to make a\nbreakthrough because like let's be\nhonest like when you have a team when\nyou have a team of like three or let's\nsay five let's say if you have a team of\nfive actually good people\n>> it's it's quite a struggle to build\nsomething because the five people might\nbe pulling in different directions. But\nwhen you but when you give a task like\nbuild an orchestrator to to claude 5 4.5\nand then out pops a a product and you\nknow 10 minutes later you're like\nwondering what the hell's going on now.\n>> This is like a classic case of Captain\nHindsight like you know\n>> Captain Hindsight.\n>> You know Captain Hindsight from South\nPark?\n>> No. No I don't actually.\nHe comes to a burning building and\npeople are screaming and they're like,\n\"Save us, Captain Hindsight.\" And say,\n\"That building is built too close to the\nother building and there should be a\nfire exit there. You're welcome.\" And he\ngoes away. Like\nanyway, um it's like they spent years\ndesigning this and iterating through\ndifferent versions. and she approached\ncloud and you prompted it just an\nindicator that an expert with experience\ninto certain systems and knowing the\ntrade-offs is able to build something\nlike within 5 days with it, but it\ndoesn't represent all of the, you know,\nmistakes that they made along the way\nand all of the retries they had to do\nand the different iterations that went\nthrough.\n>> So, it would have taken a lot longer.\nBut reality is yes. I mean you can you\ncan definitely take an idea and iterate\nand and then or build an MVP and try it\nout and then realize all the problems\nthat you have with it and then quickly\nthrow it away and and and step back and\ndo another one. Uh which is what what\nSteve Jie said when he was building\nGastown, right? He did the Python\nversion then did the Golang version and\nand he says like he basically spun it up\nlooked at the agents what they were\ntrying to do and then because he has\nthis idea like we talked about last time\nyou you built the the flags and the\ncommands that the agents are trying like\nthey hey here's beats issue tracker\ncreate an issue and it goes like okay bd\ncreate and in an error it's create d-\ndescription oh the description should be\na positional argument instead of a flag\nyou know so he makes the the tool to\nbehave like like the agents and then\nwhen he was building gas town he tries\nit. The agents are like struggling. He\nhe kills it. He just looks at what they\ndid and then he builds those flags and\nthose commands. They said it took like\nthree four iterations and finally the\nagents were like intuitively picking\neverything up and started to just turn\ncode out on their own. That's when I\nknew I had it. That's when I knew it was\nready to go. And since then it's been\nrunning and he has like received 30\ndifferent uh pull requests and like it's\nbarely four days and he says it's taken\ntaking off like crazy. This thing is\ngoing on its own. And another really\ncool uh observation he made was that\nbeats was launched in October. It wasn't\npart of the training corpus of LLMs. Yet\nthey were very good at using it. But\nwhat else is happening is all of these\nLLMs get retrained with the new updated\ndata and they will be intuitive on\nbeats. They will be trained on beats.\n>> They will know how to use it and they\nwill know how to use Gasttown. So it's\nonly going to get better. they're only\ngoing to get more intuitive with Gaston\nis what he said. And I thought that was\na really cool um takeaway as well. It's\nbasically, you know, the what they call\nit pointing.\n>> That's one thing that I found quite\nfrustrating with the skills because I\nwrote a skill to help me like\nI wrote a skill to help me um to use uh\nthe GitHub CLI for example, right? Like\nthis one here. Like if I give you this\nURL then you can view it and you can for\nsome reason that I need to put the ch\noverride the GH pager otherwise when you\nwhen you run when when you run GitHub\nrun ls it just stops you know what I\nmean you have to press Q to to to get\nout of it\n>> it blocks I don't know why the GitHub\nCLI works that way\n>> but you don't have you have to do that\nin your in your terminal but if you do\nif you go in in cloud and you do execute\nter uh shell you will don't have to do\nit because the pager in in cloud is not\nset like the TTY is different.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But like in VS code um it\nruns it in the terminal and the page is\nthe same as your terminal and it gets\nstuck.\n>> Really cloud code did not get stuck for\nme.\n>> Yeah. But I understand the cloud code\nwouldn't because it has a different uh\nenvironment. But the the way that VS\nCode works slightly different. But\nanyway, what I'm trying to say here is\nthat um I wrote this and then I did a\ntest like do the thing like here's the\nthing\n>> with with the skill and then or or\nwithout the skill then with the skill\nand see if if the skill actually was\nused and did it actually even work. And\nthe funny thing was is that it was kind\nof helpful for um for for uh\n>> until you hit 40% context remain\n>> for for for OpenAI for for basically\ndumb models. But Claude 4.5 knew how to\nrun GH CLI without even uh me telling it\nto do it\n>> right. Yeah.\n>> So it's like what you said with beads.\nIt's like we're getting to a stage where\nlike the models are trained to do these\nthings to to get these new skills and\nthen you and then it gets to a point\nthen like why is that skill even there?\nIt's just it's just polluting the\ncontext, right? Because now the model\neven knows how to do this and I don't\neven have to tell it to do this.\n>> Yeah, it's a bit it's a bit subtler I\nthink because I think\nbut it's it's right. I mean ultimately\nit just directs in a way we don't\nunderstand how these things work right I\nmean it there's just like terabytes of\ndata going into\nlayers of of of what do they call it\n>> inference models or whatever\n>> it's more like neural neural networks\nyeah yeah but I I do I do things that\nthat I there's one step that I ask it to\ndo which I don't think it does\nautomatically\nAnd that is to check\nI mean the whole the whole GitHub CLI\nexperience is insane. They sort of hide\nthe the commit for some bizarre reason\nin the CLI.\n>> So basically I tell it to like please\ncheck what the commit was and make sure\nit's same as the one that's local.\nOtherwise we know we're getting off to a\nbad start.\n>> Right. Nice. Yeah. This is a type of\nlike small little details that you\nwouldn't get in a training corpus,\nright? That is like\n>> yeah,\n>> you know, if you're trying to do this\ntask, there's this little um catch that\nyou need to watch out for that that you\nneed to that the skill really is useful\nfor. But even then, like I feel that\nthese skills are they say that if you\nhit 40% context window remaining, then\nthe model models turn into dumb. It's\ntime to cut. Like the moment I see I'm\nI'm the task is complete. And if it's\nlike 45% I'm like okay time for the\nhandover you know don't try to tackle\nanything else. Uh because they will\nstart doing these things where even\nthough I have like the skill and I have\nit repeated in my initial prompt on the\nsession plus there's a skill plus I have\nto say it again and yet it still doesn't\ndo it sometimes. It's like okay\n>> yeah that's\nthat's we've talked about it before but\nI I see it a lot online. And it's like\nyeah I've I've given the skill I've\ngiven the claw MD but it doesn't\nactually do what I asked it to do.\nSo there's so so from so so from from\nboth angles we have a problem here like\nwe we have models are improving so that\nyou don't even need the skill and then\nthe other side that when you even write\nthe skill it doesn't take it on\nsome do better than others. It also\ndepends on what sort of need in the\ncontext. This is one thing that I\nrealized very weird. I was working on a\na project and I had like broken down the\ntasks. Um and\nand this is one of the things I talk\nabout why Ralph Wiggum is good because\nnormally you will break down the task\nand you will um you will create a big\nplan of this then that right do this\nthen do this then do this. But then if\nyou need to adjust course adjust in the\nmiddle you're kind of like oh where does\nthat go? and and if you have like a long\nlist of tasks, it's a bit harder to\nreadjust everything. Um, but what I was\ntrying to say is that\nfor some reason I had a very big task\nlist with very clear specifications on\neach task and I had never told it to do\nsomething. Um, and for some reason one\nof the previous hand session handoffs,\nmaybe Opus decided to add this little\nhelpful example code snippet, but it\ndoesn't match at all my original task\ndesign for the next next task. It says\ndo this. And so I I kicked off open\ncode. It was one of the first times I\nused open code and codeex in open code\nand it started to do this completely\ndifferent thing. And I was like, hold on\na minute. I never told it to do that.\nAnd I went, where does it come from? I\nstarted blaming open code from not\nreading the task properly. And then I\nnoticed it was in the session handle\nfrom Opus. I was like, where did Opus\nget that from? And then when I I I\nremoved it. I I get reset the whole\ntree, got rid of everything that open\ncode has done because I didn't want\nthat. It was one very early little code\nsnippet and I removed that little\nsnippet that Opus added for fun and\nsuddenly it worked perfectly exactly as\nas planned. So this can be frustrating\nif you don't pay attention. Yeah,\n>> I think like at the context degradation,\n>> for some reason it didn't follow the pre\npre-existing research and thought it\nmight be helpful and and and a little\nbit like do a little bit extra\nsometimes, right?\n>> Well, I guess going back to the whole\nproduct owner versus engineer, I think I\nthink engineers are a little bit more\ndetail orientated, right? We we would\nprobably catch that.\n>> I don't know. I I can't say those things\nbecause there's so many different\nengineers and owners product. I can't\nsay again like I said it's the people\nthat are able to reinvent themselves\neither they're an engineer or a product\nowner and they're able to to to get the\nreps in and to explore and they're\ncurious and they keep going at it even\nif it's not the perfect\n>> you are right I agree\n>> it's not because somebody decided to be\nowner\n>> why does\n>> one day\n>> why the hell doesn't any of Steve Jger's\n>> has to pass\n>> oh no it does pass it I needed a BD in\nit.\n>> Oh, so you needed a SQL database\n>> and then it worked.\n>> I mean, this is for gas town.\n>> Uh,\n>> I mean, did it? Yeah,\n>> now it's running the cache, right?\n>> Because go test by default, we know.\n>> How do you make it not dash count on the\nif you go to the make file? So cloud\nalways says it's actually dangerous when\nyou use cloud because um\n>> like how do I make it do a non-cash one?\nUh\n>> dash count\n>> dash count.\n>> Yeah, dash count one space one. That's\nwhat cloud always does.\n>> What does that work?\n>> What? How is that intuitive?\n>> It's about the parallelism of the task\nor something. If you do it again, I I\ndon't remember exactly, but when when\nyou were\n>> it's gonna be cached.\n>> Nope.\n>> What?\n>> Cash breaks\n>> just by doing count one.\n>> Yeah, there I remember why at some\npoint, but at this point, I don't care\nanymore cuz like when I see this and I\nask cloud, it just says it just at the\ncount. And like the first time I was\nlike, heck, why? Now I'm like, yeah,\nwhatever. You're right.\nDoes it does it do what I expect? Oh,\nyes it does. Okay. I I uh I have to go\nnow.\n>> Okay. Okay. Oh, generated by claw code.\nGenerated by claw code. Interesting.\n>> But look at who. It was Gus. It was\nJack.\n>> Who are these people?\n>> Author Kiru, Gus. These are the\ndifferent pcats in G in in in Gast Town.\nOh,\n>> Jack, Gus,\n>> George, Max,\n>> Dave,\nand then there's Deacon. And then\nthere's\n>> Black Finger.\n>> Wow, man. I got to have a closer look at\nthis. Okay, thanks for the chat. I think\nthat was good stuff. See you. Bye bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:11]\nOkay. Ralph Wigan number one on the agenda. >> Well, you put it number one. Don't act surprised. You expected me to bump it down. >> Well, to be honest, I wanted to put it like second to uh you demoing the the thing that you're trying to demo to me >> cuz you're afraid we're going to run out of time. >> Oh my god, there's a lot to cover and I need to basically take my kids off in 10 minutes. But like maybe >> you call me 10 minutes before you go and then >> I don't know if you like like if you had 10 minutes and you wanted to talk about something what you want to talk about you choose >> the memes around Ralph Wigum. I like him. >> What what is Ralph Wigum? >> Okay. So I saw a very niceation >> where Ralph Wigum is a Simpson character. the guy who sits on the train in the class and that ate the crayons and the very famous meme where he's on the bus and the bus is about to crash and he goes like I'm in danger. It's like it's it's a classic character like a clueless character. Um, and so it's kind of fitting for the fact that you just put it in put cloud in a loop. And I like it um because one of the breakdowns of why it is successful is basically it just means that um that the models have become so good. I I thought putting them in a loop was pretty much what Gast Town was doing with a little bit of coordination. >> No, no, no. Gast Town. So I I like the second blog post that that Steve Jger g did, which is way more the background than how it came to be what it is. I think that's a gentle introduction to Gast Town. So he has the original announcement. Here's Gast Town. Cost $600 a month to run it. It's crazy. Don't do it. Caveat. Watch out. And um and then he did a second and with a full breakdown. It's very hard to follow because it's like introducing all of these different concepts but using you know names that don't make sense like bcats and and uh scrapyard and towns and the way that towns communicate. I still don't understand the difference between like why can't you just say agents are mailing each other? No, we have to see bullot bulls live. >> I think I I often think to myself that uh in our industry terminology is actually a big part of what we do, right? Using the right words is the right and and AI agents >> is already kind of overloaded as >> sensitive to words. Oh, it's >> I mean like agents I' I've seen if you like I don't know if you go along on YouTube and you and you like some people have like weird ideas what agents are. I think and like…\n\n[slide:2] [4:50–15:11]\n>> Oh god no. >> Yeah. Yeah. But you know you cringe the moment I say this. I cringe the moment I read like Paul Catz and all and then he says to avoid copyright he mixes Mad Max terminology with others uh to make sure that like no single um enterprise can go after you know him for copyright claims or trademarks. He said, \"No wonder.\" And no one. Anyway, what I was trying to say is, and we were getting back to Ralph Wiggum, is that the second article is way better because he really explains um exactly how and how many iterations he went because he create original vibe coder and then he created VC and then he created a Python version of Gastown. He had a couple of workshops. Uh I think it's the second one there. Yeah. And then he did the Golang version of Gaston and he he kind of explains his experiences using Python versus Golang and um you know what worked, what didn't work and like he went to through three or four iterations of um Gaston. So it's a very good I like this one. It's a way more gentler introduction to how it came to be what it is. Um but it is a very interesting way and is a very interesting you know group of people are approaching agent orchestration by building it in a non-engineering way. For example, is it better to create git work trees and let every agent work in an isolated work like git branch and then deal with the branch conflicts like merge conflicts or and that's another approach. Is it better to all let them all like let's say you're in three or four agents at the same time on the same file system and give them a way to communicate with each other and reserve files so that they don't create these conflicts at in the first place. And as an engineer, >> yeah, blocking a folder or something. Yeah. >> Yeah. So, as an engineer, you come with a long background of like git and versioning and collaboration that takes several days and you know this type of workflow, whereas these agents work at a very different like speed and have a much better way of coordinating than us. So, approaching it from a non-engineer perspective, which is what um this guy, I forgot his name now on Twitter. He built the the mail system that Gasttown uses. So basically this male MCP for agents to communicate is all coming from non-engineers looking at this O AI um hype from a completely different angle like a non-engineering angle and I thought that was very interesting to read and I think Ralph Wigum is also an approach to that right stop trying to build too…\n\n[slide:3] [14:50–25:13]\nscript, right? you say first go to this URL >> then click on the login page >> then you will be redirected automatically to another page wait for the um username text box to be available or element to be available >> I have scripts like that myself >> but that's a script that is a maybe you know 20 lines and that gets generated by the LLM and sent to playright and it executes in one go and it may get the reading that script wastes a ton of tokens in my experience. >> Oh, it doesn't. Why would it? What? It literally didn't not I I never wrote playright in my life and I was like I would love to be able to do more of an end to end. So maybe I share my screen. I don't have >> Okay. >> Uh >> Okay. Yeah, you got to you got to demonstrate this workflow. I'm very curious. Like for example, could you could you show a workflow where um >> not on requests? I can show you what I have. >> Okay. >> No, but I want to see how you create it. Like go to like debase.com >> and also >> listen to a podcast or something. I mean that's very simple. There's no login here or anything. >> Validate that there's a >> send me that in advance and I will try >> Kim. >> Yeah. >> Thank you. Thank you uh Abiooft for creating Kalema. I mean I'd be dead if I didn't I mean Mac OS would so suck if it didn't add Kalema. Yeah. All the other ones you need to pay, right? >> Exactly. >> Yeah. So, I have like test users, Alice user, platform user, new user with no groups and and I'm validating that these users are not able, you know, to do things. So, it has like >> you coded this with the AI, right? >> Yeah. I I don't know how to write any of this. I have not written a single letter of code in this test. >> Okay. Okay. So, so it's 170 lines. >> Okay. >> Right. >> Um the the setup thing is the coolest thing because it does the E2E setup which um as you can see it makes sure that the containers are running and then it makes sure that the users like it creates a user by creating the Alice user inside um inside click and and creates the test user with certain password and and and everything. It also goes against my API to register the user role. So if if I in kick look I create a user a certain group membership and in my API I create group membership to role mapping. So it does both ends. Okay. Right. So this playright test. So that's like a UI for running the script. >> Yes. So and this is this is gold and uh because if I >> it's amazing I tell you. So once everything's up right now the server is up…\n\n[slide:4] [24:52–35:15]\nnobody talking about this this awesome features that are in in playright that are like way better than the stupid MCP. So okay, let's close the console again. >> Yeah, the >> this one should fail now. It should >> a lot of people have gone off the ball with MCP. >> Yeah, expect to be visit. Wait, wait, wait. It's probably going to time out, right? >> Kaboom. >> May maybe I need to build my web app again. No, it failed. It errors, right? >> Yeah, >> it failed here. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Here it says expect locator to be visible failed. >> Yeah, >> it says locator here and then copy prompt. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> And you go into your code and you go into cloud and you say, \"Hey, um, well, don't use this prompt because it's going to >> That's the biggest prompt I've ever seen in my life. It's like 20 pages. How many lines of code is that?\" >> But it's everything that you would It's It's a lot shorter. >> Just scroll just scroll down. Like, how how long is this thing? Just scroll down. >> Keep your knickers on. >> They're on. Trust me. >> 300 lines. Not that much. Come on. >> What the hell? That's but that's amazing. But at the same time, >> it's absolutely amazing because it goes like look this is what the page is. Here's the YAML. This is the page snapshot. The thing I told you it has this this YAML representation of the page. And if I give this if I just give this right now >> HTML >> it 100% cloud will go like yo the the loc the location button has a two to it. It changed for sure. It will find it in a sec in an instant. Not even going to I'm not giving it permission to write. I'm just going to launch cloud real fast. Paste that in. >> Probably going to waste $10 on this on this uh >> now. I haven't used cloud all day. It's fine. Use 77% of the commitment. >> It's fine. It resets um on the Thursday. Yeah, it's still enough. 25% for Wednesday should be enough. One day more than enough. Okay, look. It didn't even have to go through anything like the test expect the element to be like this. But your profile button um would you like me to read? Yes, read it. Let's read. It didn't read. It just said uh it fails because the it looking for this button. It can't find this button. So, it hasn't even read the odd state yet, but immediately it's going to say, \"Oh, you have a the test ID change.\" >> Okay. Well, I >> There you go. It says like there there's your problem. The test ID doesn't match. >> Okay. Very good demo. Very good demo. Vincent, >> not not prepared at all.…\n\n[slide:5] [34:54–45:20]\nrefuses. And so he's telling him like, \"Look at what they need to mimic a fraction of our power because they need all of these machines to fly and all, but we we have so much more power.\" And and so basically here the GPT 5.2 users are making fun of it because I think it's very funny a very funny meme because when you use cloud code, it goes very fast but it makes mistakes, right? So you put it in a loop but if you use codeex or GPD 5.2 two, it goes very slow, but it ends up being correct because it like spends a lot of time actually reasoning and making changes. It kind of has the loop built in and and and that's kind of a >> joke. So, GPT 5.2 already has this kind of flow >> because, you know, it's so much slower and people are like, I hate GPT5 because it's so slow. It's not feel doesn't feel snappy. But then on the other side, you have all these cloud users that are so snappy having to put it into a stupid loop. Yeah, that's a typical trade-off between speed and uh and uh quality, I suppose. If it's fast enough, it doesn't really matter, does it? Or >> it can pave over the cracks quickly or something. I >> I don't know. It depends on the complexity of the task, you know, and because we're so bad at selecting the the models ourselves or the automatic selecting doesn't really work well. I'm happy to have a model that is very snappy for most of the things that I need it to do and then when it needs to do a super hard troubleshooting thing that I need to let it loop a bit I'm also okay with it or maybe I just switch over myself but I would rather have something that's always fast than something like GPT5. Yeah, I thought it was a funny a funny u you know reference. >> Open code became the default on Omari >> default >> the default. So, Omari ships with CH GPT and cloud code and they switched u as a default CLI agent to open code. So, they use Ghosti already by default and now they made open I mean they just added the package as far as I could tell. But yeah, yeah, I'm I'm so impressed with Omari. Um I'm really impressed. >> But the the greatest thing about it is Omari DHH is very much focused on um the the theming, right? He he forked chromium so just that he could apply the theme >> color. I think the theming is a way of hook of attracting people. I mean I think I think I think DHH is is next level. I think he has a very good sense of taste. You need that that that polish that that the Linux desktop has been missing. and Amachi with the themes. I I know…\n\n[slide:6] [44:59–50:55]\ntrader >> that that came up with these systems. I guess I'm biased to think how engineers are going to scale up, but I'm also >> Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to figure out in my brain is like I think I think I know where I need to go, but but where do the existing people need to go too also? Like I I guess all these skills that we're learning are accessible to anyone really. Yeah, it's just a matter of who is passive to reinvent themsel and who can, you know, because this is one thread I saw on on on Twitter now. I used to say always say I saw it on Reddit. Now I start to say I saw it on Twitter. Um which is like >> some people they're just doing their 9 to5. They have their family life. They have no time to explore this. And then you have other people >> that have nothing but time. Maybe they're unemployed or they're just like Steve addicted to to these things and they're just uh you know Steve Jay was saying I'm running cloud code while I'm driving like it's it's on my laptop in my car and and like I'm on it all the time and um >> yeah people investing their time. Yeah, I guess it's all about that people investing time. >> He said I had 1 million and this is another thing they say right? You need to get in the reps. you need to be like you need to exercise and it becomes a body to to muscle like mind to body uh connection but when you're on the topic because everyone is going off uh and misrepresenting this tweet from this Google engineer principal engineer at Google uh Jana Doan or Rakil who build >> Yeah Raquel yeah yeah I I love that lady she's written some great stuff >> load testers and stuff in >> yeah it's one of my favorite tools >> yeah I also use it so she said that they spent several years as a team um building. >> Oh, do you have the tweet? >> Did she still have it on her account? She might have removed it cuz I think many people just jumped on it and said like you see AGI is here because um you know Cloud Code was able to do it in a week what they spent years to do. Yeah, this is that's the one, right? I'm not joking and this isn't funny. >> Yeah, I I I hate it. This person screenshotted her like what is that because she removed it? >> I think she might.

  "summary": "This clip is a technical conversation that jumps between memes, agent orchestration, LLM-driven testing, and developer tooling. The hosts use the Ralph Wiggum meme as a framing joke to discuss why simple looping patterns can outperform heavy orchestration, then dig into Steve Yegge’s Gastown design choices and iterations, a live demo of LLM-generated Playwright end-to-end tests, token and cost tradeoffs when models send large page snapshots, and higher-level debates about who will adapt to agent-first workflows (engineers, product people, or curious hobbyists). The tone mixes practical demos (a working Playwright test suite generated by an LLM) with design lessons drawn from multiple Gastown iterations and the limits of current “skills” and context windows.  \n[slide:1]\n## Ralph Wiggum as shorthand for looping agents\nThe hosts open by awarding the “Ralph Wiggum” meme status to a class of agent workflows that rely on simple loops rather than heavy orchestration. The meme (“I’m in danger.”) is used to mock quick, looped approaches that can be surprisingly effective because “the models have become so good.” They contrast lightweight looping with more feature-rich orchestrations and link that intuition to Steve Yegge’s Gastown posts, which document multiple design passes and tradeoffs in agent naming, components and communication patterns. *\"I'm in danger.\"* *\"the models have become so good.\"*  \n[slide:2]\n## Gastown, naming, and orchestration tradeoffs\nThey discuss Steve Yegge’s two posts: an initial Gastown announcement (noting a $600/month running cost) and a longer second post that explains iterations (Python → VC → Golang, several workshops). The conversation highlights problematic terminology (bcats, scrapyard, towns) and why naming matters: engineers want concrete terms (OCR scanner microservice) rather than obscure project handles. Two orchestration approaches are compared: giving each agent isolated git worktrees/branches and resolving merge conflicts later versus sharing a single filesystem with coordination primitives (file reservations/locks) to avoid conflicts upfront. The hosts note Gastown’s mail/MCP was conceived by non-engineers and argue that non-engineering perspectives can surface simpler, effective coordination models.  \n[slide:3]\n## Playwright demo: LLM-generated end-to-end tests\nOne host demos an end-to-end Playwright test suite that was generated entirely by an LLM (no handwritten test code). The test setup is ~170 lines; it bootstraps containers, creates test users (Alice, platform user, new user with no groups), registers roles in the API, then runs UI flows (login, refresh, assert session persistence). Tests are launched in parallel: separate Chrome instances (non-headless) run multiple workers simultaneously. A simple successful login-and-refresh run completed in about 3 seconds in the demo. The script waits for selectors (test IDs) and verifies UI states; failure modes are exposed with browser console output and screenshots. The demo emphasizes that an LLM can produce executable Playwright scripts that perform complete E2E checks and environment setup.  \n[slide:4]\n## Debugging with page snapshots, huge prompts, and token costs\nWhen a test fails because an element can’t be found, Playwright produces a structured page snapshot (a YAML-like DOM skeleton) plus encoded screenshots; feeding that snapshot to an LLM produces a comprehensive diagnostic. The demo showed an automatically generated LLM prompt that included the page structure and a large failure trace — the prompt reached a few hundred lines (~300 lines reported) and included the YAML snapshot and context. Pasting that snapshot into a fast cloud model immediately identified a changed test ID as the cause. The hosts highlight two costs here: (1) token bloat from sending large encoded images and page dumps (Playwright’s MCP approach can send B64 screenshots and structural data that are very large), and (2) real-money API wallet surprises — one anecdote described a paid subscription where enabling “extra usage” burned a monthly $20 allowance quickly. The overall point: Playwright’s script-based approach bundles logic server-side (smaller chat turns) while snapshot-based MCP-style interactions can balloon token usage; both approaches have tradeoffs for debugging and cost.  \n[slide:5]\n## Model speed vs quality, tooling defaults, and small platform anecdotes\nThey contrast two model behaviors: very fast, looped cloud-code workflows that may require repetition and external loops versus slower models (GPT-5.2 in discussion) that internally iterate and produce more correct outputs. This is framed as a speed/quality tradeoff: snappy models that need orchestration loops versus slower-but-deeper reasoning. The hosts also note ecosystem moves: one distro/toolchain (Omari) ships with an open-code CLI agent by default and bundles cloud-code/agent tooling to simplify the dev experience; installer anecdotes claim very fast installs (one host reported a 3-minute install, another 6 minutes 20 seconds), and emphasis on theming and polish as a user-acquisition lever. These details illustrate how developer ergonomics and default tooling choices shape who adapts to agent workflows.  \n[slide:6]\n## Skills, context-window limits, roles, and the future of agent tooling\nThey close with meta issues: “skills” can become redundant as models learn common CLIs (example: models eventually know how to run GitHub CLI without explicit skill injection), but skills still capture small platform-specific traps (e.g., GH pager behavior, commit checks). Context degradation matters: hosts cut off tasks before the tail of the session to avoid “dumb” behavior when remaining context is low. They debate who will adapt: engineers, product owners, or hobbyists—concluding it’s about who invests time to get reps and learn the new patterns. Steve Yegge’s Gastown is singled out as an example of iterative design: several passes (three or four iterations) produced a flow that agents now use intuitively, and because LLMs will be retrained on public repos, *tools like Gastown and Beats will only become easier for models to use over time.* The clip closes with a mix of technical demos, concrete operational caveats (costs, token bloat, CI flakiness observed in a repo), and practical advice about keeping goals narrow so LLM-driven agents don’t drift."
