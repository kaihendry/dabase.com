    "content": "Transcript:\nCool, man. That's I'm just trying to\nthink of what we spoke last week so we\ndon't sound like broken records\nrepeating ourselves about\n>> last week. Gemini just came out. Um\n>> I just rewatched it before this call\n>> and we talked. Um\n>> yeah, but no, I forgot everything. Yeah,\nI I mentioned that I got some good time\nin on anti-gravity, the new\nIDE that Google launched.\n>> I haven't I haven't tried that.\nOh man, I I'm going to\n>> Yeah, I guess I guess we were I I think\nwe're we're both anthropic Claude fans,\naren't we?\n>> And guess who else since 20 hours ago\nsaid he is a fan who is a massive\nantiropic dude. quite famous\n>> andropic who\n>> T3 G3\n>> also Theo is like every time he posts a\nvideo for a while on Reddit people would\nbe like he's obviously an open AI shell\nhe gets private access to some of their\num models and um and and and basically\npeople he will never say anything\npositive about Antropic he hates\nAntropic um but he did a video was\nUh,\nit was\n>> Let maybe share your screen.\n>> Okay.\n>> I do watch a fair few Theo videos, but\nto be honest, I don't subscribe cuz he's\none of those. It's like like Primogen\nand Theo. Their content is good, but I\ndo find it like a bit too much actually.\nFor some reason, I I feel like only\ndipping in when I want to.\n>> You see it? So\nwe talked about AI for infrastructure\nengineers.\n>> Oh yeah,\n>> that's subscribe.\n>> But there was um I am subscribed. No,\n>> I don't know.\n>> And there was um\nI was going to I was hoping that the\ntitle would ring me a few more bells,\nbut I also rewatched what we discussed\nabout based infrastructure a little bit.\nBut basically this was posted.\nUm\nI tried to open it in a\nnew window.\n>> Not what I wanted to do.\n>> Oh my god. You don't have premium.\n>> Uh no. Why would I pay?\n>> You're an animal.\n>> Where's the\n>> It's not this one. This one is about\nopening eye. This one.\n>> I have a new favorite model.\n>> How many hours ago? 22 hours ago. So\nlittle.\n>> Oh, he's he is\nhe\n>> is this some sort of ironic?\n>> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He he goes\ninto great detail. Surprisingly has a\nlot of benchmarks. He does a very\ninteresting demonstrations comparing the\noutput of different models. He says Opus\n4.5 got massive boost in UI generation,\nthat the entropic models generally were\nnot good at that originally, um, but\nthat it's really much better at it right\nnow. So he has this um snitchbench\nrepository and he uses cursor with git\nwork trees and he says in this video\nfive times that get work trees are not\nworking in cursor and that they're\nworking on it but it makes his life a\nliving hell and every time he talks\nabout his workflow he mentions work\ntrees and how they're broken. It's\nreally um anyway\n>> yeah I mean there's some things about\ngit that I've never really enjoyed like\nsubm modules and things like that. Oh,\nsome modules stay away from, right? But\ngit works sound like very interesting in\nthe age of AI where you can just spin\noff a branch in a different subdirectory\nand have like a PC quickly, you know,\ndeveloped by\n>> you need it, don't you? You need it.\nYeah, even speckit idea is also to like\ndefine the specification and spin off in\nimplementation\num and so that you can do different PC's\nlike maybe you have the user stories and\nfunctional requirements but then you\nimplement it in like five different ways\nand different technologies different.\n>> So wait a minute I thought you were\nsaying that Theo was team open AI and\nnow he's anthropic.\nHe's yeah he he gets access and early\naccess to AI open AI and he does not get\nany access and then when he talks about\nit in this video he mentions like\nthere's a few other um\nAI channels that are benchmarking models\nthat are also not getting early access\nto the entropic models and he's happy to\nbe in the same boat as them. something\nlike Antropic is horrible. Um, but I've\ngot to give it to them. This opens 4.5\nis insanely good. And\n>> okay, sorry.\n>> He als he he also ranks here. He talks\nabout the the output the UI output of\nOpus and then he he gives his ranking\nhere of output ceiling versus\nconsistency and um he hasn't finished it\nthere. So, but to him he still says\nyeah. What does output ceiling mean?\n>> The best you can get out of it. Like\nlike sometimes you give it a prompt and\nit gives like a really amazing output.\nHe says a couple of times GPT 5.1 Pro\nreally beat Gemini 3 um by a mile. And\nthen\nthe problem is the consistency\num that you get from these models is\nnothing compared to open opus like oppus\nand son they are very consistent. So\nhe's reranking them on the right saying\nuh or left however is this mirrored? No\nit's not mirrored. Um yeah [snorts]\nanyway um but Gemini tree\nI think last time we talked I mentioned\nthat I had very limited access to Gemini\ntree because uh I used Google cloud code\nassist uh licenses. I have a Google\ncloud account. It's a personal one but\nyou can subscribe to um Gemini in GCP.\nSo you can run code assist and you can\nthen use it and you get access to like\nthe the Google cloud models but the way\nthat they release it to different\nsubscription plans is a little bit\ndifferent. So you can subscribe to\nGemini AI Pro or um and you can even get\nlike a massive promotion for 3 months or\nso at half the price or whatever it was\nto to use it to to that that Gemini\nGemini Gemini AI Pro subscription. But\nfor some reason to me it made more sense\ngiven I already have my my billing\naccounts in GCP to just use the the\nseats there. I basically\n>> was trying to see if I could use it.\nClicked for one month subscription\nbefore I knew it. I realized that that\nwas probably not the best way to do it.\nUh figured out how to assign a seat\nbecause they have users within Google\naccount Google cloud that you then have\nto allocate to licenses. You can do that\nautomatically. So when you sign into\n>> GCP is like project. So there's there's\na project concept and then and then then\nthere's a seed concept or something.\n>> Yeah. So on one one side it's really\ncool that you have so many ways to\nauthenticate and you can use an API key,\nyou can use the Gemini AI, you can use\nthis and that on the other side is they\nare not consistent in the way that\nthey're giving the different\nsubscriptions access to the new models.\nAnd so the only way I had access was\nthrough the anti-gravity\nuh IDE which is apparently just Windsor\nrebranded because if you search for\nstrings they still have the original\nWindsor strings in there apparently. But\nanyway, so um so that's and there it's\nfree access so it's nerfed right because\num it's against my accounts but the the\navailability of the model is constantly\nlike um to make sure my experience was\nnot unique and to have a bigger you know\nbackground around benchmarking I watched\nthree or four videos as you can see from\nmy uh\n>> from my my history around these latest\nmodel announcements.\n>> Right. Right.\n>> So,\n>> so my experience was horrible. Uh after\nthe first\n>> for Gemini, you're saying, right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah. After the first\n>> Sorry, who who owns who owns Wind Surf\nnow? The earlier comment you made.\n>> Okay. So there was a stream\n>> there was a stream of like um also a\nlive stream just 20 hours ago from the\nMastra people which building AI\nworkflows and they went a little bit\ninto the drama of windsurf because\nwindsurf was like the startup um and I\nthink the CEO or founder was poached\naway they were like negotiating a\ncontract with Google uh but then Google\ndidn't manage to acquire them afraid for\nantitrust lawsuits or thing. So they\njust took the CEO. He left his whole\nteam behind and all the IP.\nSo he joined Google within one one or\ntwo months.\nI don't know why. On the right my my\nsuggestions.\n>> So basically when Surf went from like a\nhuge valuation to to the CEO being\npoached. I guess that's kind of smart.\n>> I know. horrible for the the early like\nearly team because all of these guys\nprobably gave up a good amount of their\nlife working full stop on this startup\nand then the CEO just walks away with\nall the IP and the company is still\nthere. They're still employed but it's\nworth nothing or something like that.\n>> Yeah. So everybody hates that CEO. I did\nwatch I did watch a like a hacker news Y\ncominator interview with I think the CEO\nof Windsurf and I did find it\ninteresting how the company started by\nlike I think they were doing like GPU\ntype of 3D gaming cloud stuff and then\nthey pivoted into uh to Windsurf.\n>> Yeah. Um, so, so basically\nthey were saying that they got like 10\nseconds of good use out of it. They\nkicked off a plan and they immediately\ngot like 10 seconds after 10 seconds is\nGemini Tree just said, \"No, I'm\noverloaded.\" Um, or uh you reach your\nquota. Um, so for me, I feel like I got\na lot more out of Gemini tree initially.\nUm but what really made my impression\nbad over the last week is one that the\nway for me to get access to it is\nimpossible. Um I have to go on a waiting\nlist but I haven't like received an\napproval on the form to all go on the\nwaiting list. They have a question which\nis like are you contributing to Gemini\nCLI? I'm like no. So guess what you're\nnot going to get it. [laughter] I don't\nknow\n>> why questions.\n>> Why ask right? When I see that question,\nI'm already like, \"Yeah, okay.\"\n>> Okay,\n>> I guess not then.\n>> But then on the opposite, Opus released\nwas it yesterday for me? Like for me it\nwas yesterday. Was it for you yesterday?\nOpus the announcement of Antropic was\nyesterday, right?\n>> I don't know. It was fading days of\nfading. Maybe the day before yesterday,\nbut yeah,\n>> it was like Monday, right? Today's\nWednesday. Yeah, it was like Monday\nduring the day and I woke up on Tuesday\nand [snorts] I and it was released and\nandropic\nlitm I mean made it so simple right in\ncloud code you can go extra usage I mean\nyou can yeah you can go extra usage\nand it will immediately throw you into\nthe into your account management your\nbilling [snorts] uh page and you can\njust use your credit card because I'm\nalready a subscriber it already has my\nbilling um method there, right? So, I\ncan just click, okay, top up wallet and\nI immediately have like I don't know, I\nput in $30 uh equal to like a month\nsubscription, $13 and um and right away\nI have access to Opus straight up. I can\njust slash Oopus. There you go. 4.5.\nEven though I pay $20 a month or $30 a\nmonth in Singapore dollars\n>> uh for just the pro subscription, I can\nuse OPUS, but it's API uh charges. That\nmeans it's not like on your monthly uh\nbudget, you get charged by the call. And\nI thought like it's supposedly much more\ntoken efficient and therefore they say\nin terms of cost, it's almost similar to\nSA 4.5. That's what you get when you are\na Max Pro user. They say when you're Max\nPro, you use Opus. They slashed it by\nlike a third the price. So that's one of\nthe things T3 mentioned and Tropic\nsliced the price like crazy. So first\nthey made Opus 4.1 completely useless\nand forced everyone to use Sony 4.5 and\nthen\neveryone saying they were sitting on\nthis model until Gemini came out and\nthen the next week they released 4.5.\n>> Oh, nice. Yeah. So they can move\nquickly. Hey, can I just can I just\nshare my screen here?\n>> Yeah, sure. Sure. Um,\n>> so I'm a little bit puzzled by the way\nthings work. Like I I got access to\nClaude Opus through Gemini. I mean,\nsorry, through co-pilot\npretty quickly. You can see my screen,\nright?\n>> You use Yeah, Visual Studio. No, I don't\nthink I see your screen. Sorry.\n>> You don't? Oh, god. I\n>> [clears throat]\n>> Um,\nyou don't see it at all, do you?\nOkay. May maybe let me just try share\nagain.\n>> Did you click the button?\n>> Yeah, it says I'm screen sharing.\n>> Now I see your link shared inside the\nchat. You're trying to share Excalibraw.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, now I can see it.\n>> Okay. So,\nso like, okay, let's let's we can\nannotate this with some. So, so Gemini\n3. Oh, no. That's too that's too big.\nSo, Gemini 3 came out.\nI got that. They charge 1x and then of\ncourse uh Opus got released like a\ncouple of days later.\nI thought Opus was the was the, you\nknow, the the the clever big thinking\none. How come?\n>> So, basically, Haiku is now,\nif I understand that, cheaper, right? Or\nI think that is it.\n>> Haiku. Haiku was super cheap. Yeah, I\nthink this is promotional because and\nit's preview because I don't think I I\ndon't think Opus would be the same as\nSony 4.5. It's still more than so son\n4.5. Haiku is the cheap you know like in\npros haiku is a very short um body of\ntext. Son is longer and then opus is\nyour like your big life.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So uh I just I just think it's a bit\ncurious the way that they've presented\nit here. Like I'm I mean credit to VS\nCode for even showing these clawed\noptions very well. Like I know I know\nthat the GPT\nyou know open AI is owned by Microsoft\nVS code is Microsoft they do show their\ntheir own mod models first for some\nreason they throw in gro I I don't know\nwhy I don't even know know what Raptor\nis\n>> do you know what that is\n>> no\npreview\nit's just a curious state of affairs my\nVS code manage models uh dialogue.\nSo, did have you tried Opus? Like, do\nyou agree with what Theo said? Is it all\nhunky dory? There's no controversy.\n[gasps]\n>> You know, my opinion about like I don't\nhave a proper benchmark, but my\n>> just go go on vibes.\n>> Yes. On vibes,\nI think Opus is amazing. I mean, I'm I'm\nI'm 100% entropic right now. So, um like\nI have the\n>> I'm really considering like but I don't\nhave much else to cancel, but I want to\ncancel everything and just go in like on\nthe max plan, you know, $100 on Tropic.\nThere you go.\n>> Oh my goodness. [laughter]\n>> Yeah, because I mean I think this month\nI spent about 100 anyway. I spent\n>> speaking speaking of spending money. So,\nso basically I got an email from my\nemployer\nuh and they said that I'm limited to\nlike a 50 a soft limit of $50 with\nAnthropic, but for some reason the the\nwhole Anthropic UI is messed up. I can't\nsee how much my spend is\nand looking at dashboard.\n>> Um, let me just double check.\nLast time I logged in, I I just couldn't\nsee it. It's all in under this company\naccount and I couldn't get any\nvisibility.\n>> Okay.\n>> No.\n>> Yeah. It's a bit hard to know\n>> what you can do if you if they tell give\nyou an abstract number and they and\nthere's no way for you to check.\n>> Exactly.\nBut like for example, what I like I went\nI tried um here's another thing I wanted\nto share with you.\nI went nuts with um this agents feature\nbecause I just learned about it. I\ndidn't know about it. the picture that\nyou sent about the dependable thing.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> it's interesting.\n>> Yeah. So, I basically\nset up an agent\n>> to basically merge all the dependable\nbot PRs on like 300 repos.\n>> Smart idea. [laughter]\n>> But\n>> wait, you just pulled in shalloot\non every ripple. [laughter]\n[snorts]\n>> What?\nYou know the the worm that the\nnpm worm that\n>> Oh, no. Hopefully not.\n>> Hopefully not.\n>> What's his name? Shad Halute.\n>> Well, that's I don't know, right?\n>> Okay. So, let me just run you through\nthis uh prompt. So, use the GitHub CLI,\nwhich is the name of my agent, by the\nway. I'll show you the agent in a bit.\nto spawn agents in parallel to look at\nthe issues to each of my repos\nand look to merge dependabot and then\nI'm I just thought it was prude to do\nsomething like you know touch repo name\nonce done\nto ensure the repo isn't done again\nthen I went bananas going going through\nI think it launched 50 agents in\nparallel so this was like three or four\nit was like doing three or four or five\ntool calls each one for some reason.\n>> Is this haiku or son?\n>> Uh I was using haiku.\n>> Yeah, it's really fast.\n>> And so I when it was running, you can\njust imagine this is like 3045. It also\nshowed the token here. Now that's gone\ncuz I'm just I launched up to the resume\nthing right now.\n>> Don't you have it on your screenshot? I\nthink the screenshot you sent me has it.\n>> Yeah, may maybe.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> So it it went it did the job I think as\nbest as it it could. I mean, obviously\nit runs into conflicts and some things\ngot messed up, but all in all, it's\nquite a safe process.\nAbout like, I don't know, 10 minutes\ninto the whole process, this thing kind\nof blew me away. So, you can see that\nit's processed 45\num maybe another 100 or something like\nthat.\nAnd then like\nsort of like uh halfway through the\nprocess, it says, \"Let me create a\nscript\nto process all remaining repositories\nmore efficiently.\"\n>> That's good.\n>> And I was like, \"Holy shit.\"\n>> That's what a human would do. Right.\n>> Exactly. I was like, \"Holy [ __ ] I\ndidn't even\ntell it to do that, you know.\"\n>> No, but that's exactly what you and I\nwould do, right? We would start to do it\nmanually. We would always get like\nsimilar problems and kind of get a good\nfeel about like what works, what are the\nproblems we encounter and then we make a\nscript for it. And it's kind of like\nwhat it did.\n>> Yeah. I'm like I'm like you know my\nI was getting kind of hairs on the back\nof my head type of thing. Um and then\nand then it b then it kick uh then it\nkicks off the uh the shell script and\nruns it in the background and then it\ngives you and then it checks again\n>> and then it does a bit of a summary\n>> but okay what I wanted to show you this\nis that I I just don't have a how many\nit used a bunch of tokens but I don't\nactually know how many is there some\nclever what is the way of seeing the\ncontext window it's just like context\nisn't it\n>> yeah but like the context window is not\ngoing to tell you anything. It's usually\nthe slash usage thing, but that's so\nlimited now. It's just two bars. And\nit's so funny they went from showing how\nmuch you have used uh from how much you\nhave left back to how much you have\nused. It's Did you have Did you not\nwatch that whole situation with the bar?\nYou I think you were asking me or I you\nsent me.\n>> Yeah. Like there's a lot of controversy\naround that status line and everything\nlike that. I guess that they're I mean\nit doesn't inspire confidence when they\ndo [ __ ] like that, do it, does it?\nThey're trying to hide. Funny thing is\nwhat I saw on Reddit, somebody posted\nlike how come when I use cloud code on\nmy Mac um I get the the how much I have\nleft and when I use it on my um like my\nLinux box my DBN um it shows me how much\nI have used and some comment was like\nisn't it funny that like the DBN package\nadministrator refused to integrate this\n[laughter]\nchange and he didn't like it and now\nthey're back um like in the change log\nthey said like reverted the usage bar to\nthe original. But that's [snorts] one of\nthe comments that Tio said like um you\ndid a great job on Tropic. Um I'm open\nto talk. Yeah. As if they need you. But\nanyway, and then\n>> yeah, talk to me. Um\n>> I I want to move from open AI.\n>> Yeah, he needs the red carpet. He's he\nwas also constantly showing how much he\nspent like, oh, I've you know, spent one\nhour like, oh, it's $150 now. It's a lot\nof my pocket, but I'm happy to show you\nguys the benchmark. I mean, credit\nthough. It's an impressive benchmark and\nit the way that he's very quickly\nspinning up all these models with the\nsame tasks and showing them.\n>> So, how does he how does he know how\nmuch he's spending and I have absolutely\nno clue because because of the usage of\n>> because you're in an org account it\nlooks like like on mine. So, a while ago\nwe were thinking how can we track our\nusage properly and I was like yeah I\ndon't really have an idea. I just wait\nuntil it's done and I look at my usage.\nBut now I found a decent way which is on\nmy account in my billing page I can see\nexactly how much like pretty much live\num as it is running I can see little by\nlittle my week my hourly budget filling\nup and my weekly budget filling up and\nthen my extra usage like the wallets\nthat I I put in there also filling up\nwith open\n>> maybe can you give me like a a rule of\nthumb like for example this context\nwindow here I mean it's half full.\n>> There is a package called\n>> is is is a is a half full context maybe\nyou know two bucks and a full context\nabout four you know four bucks. Can I is\nthere some rule of thumb I can use?\n>> I think is really not the way to go for\nthis because um there's even new like\nwith Opus 4.5 they added new\ncapabilities into the cloud code shell\nthings like the ability to progressively\nsearch and expose tools to the model. Um\nthe ability for the model to you know\nthis whole blog post that I did about\nMCPS.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, but this is expressed here,\nright? This is expressed in the system\nprompt, isn't it?\n>> So basically this whole shell even has a\nnew functionality to automatically\ncompact the context. So you cannot go\noff like this context status uh diagram\nto determine how much you've currently\nused because they are changing how all\nof that work and this is not meant to\ndisplay your your your usage. There's a\nthere's a tab for usage. Well, let Oh, I\nforgot to show you the um the actual\nagent.\nSo, this is what a agent looks like.\nIt's it's in the docu agents directory.\nAnd then it's kind of like a a skill,\nbut you're supposed to specify tools and\nmodel. I I mean, maybe it's an optional\nthing to be honest. So, here, as I\nmentioned, I I specified Haiku. to be\nhonest, I grabbed this from um some guy\nI've been email email conversing with,\nguy named James.\nBut yeah, so this ba this agent\nbasically\nequips Claude to use the GitHub CLI,\nwhich is, you know, the GitHub CLI is\none of the best things about GitHub,\nright? You can go nuts with it.\n>> You also wrote a skill, right? You wrote\nthe GitHub action skill for work.\n>> Yeah, I did. I did that. Yeah. So, um,\nthat's also something\nI'm I'm a little bit confused between\nagents and skills and all the rest of\nit. I'm a little bit like and also my\nClaude when I run Claude. Um, I I need\nto uninstall beads because every time I\ngo slash command, it's like 99% bloody\nbeads commands.\n>> Absolutely. This get rid of beats MCP.\nIt's a complete disaster because they\ndon't have Isn't that I think it's the\nplugin that sets all this [ __ ] up.\n>> Oh, yeah. I didn't do that. All right, I\njust installed the BD CLI. I tried the\nMCP and I already uninstalled the\n>> manage. Okay. Okay, this is going. How\ndo you uninstall? Delete to uninstall.\nOkay, it's gone. And hopefully Oh man,\nstill\n>> so I've got a story about a about skills\ncuz I I've [clears throat] used actually\ncloud code the shell\nuses has built-in agents right since a\nfew releases ago. So when you go into\nplan mode often times when you prompt it\nto start planning launches agents.\n>> Oh my goodness.\n>> Oh, you have costs. I haven't seen that.\nThere you go.\n>> They have a aside from the usage now you\nhave an because I was every single CLI\nactually has a really nice summary.\nGemini CLI.\n>> But how come that how come that was so\nWait a minute.\nHow come this I guess it doesn't have\nthe my previous run does it?\n>> Probably not. No, this is probably your\ncost from this shell session. Even if\nyou restore a previous\n>> See, this is why I don't want my\ncommands to be polluted. That's the\nfirst time I just noticed this stuff.\n>> Yeah, you beats and the the same second\nyou see the command that you needed.\n>> Yeah. [laughter]\n>> Okay, so plugins pros and cons. Um same\nwith MCPS, right? But but we were just\ntalking about agents and and I was about\nto like share with you my experience.\nYou you also don't know what's the\ndifference between skills and agents.\n>> So basically agents actually are part of\nyour shell. They come come with it no\nmatter if you build them or not.\n>> Okay. So what's what agents are there\nalready then? Are you you suggesting\nthat\n>> the planning agents the explore agents?\nIf you go into agents without building\nany uh slash agents, you will see that\nbuiltin there's two agents at least.\nYeah. And I think they're adding more.\n>> No, no. Well,\n>> oh, built in. Okay. Sorry. [ __ ] I\n[snorts] just killed the share.\n>> Let me let me share my whole screen.\nHopefully I don't share anything insane.\n>> Um,\nyeah. So in agents, I've got my GitHub\nCLI agent there. And then then it's\nbuilt\n>> in agents general purpose\nstatus line setup.\n>> I ran that one.\n>> Oh, okay. Okay. And then it sets up the\nstatus line. Okay. What is it? That\nstatus line is kind of like by default\nit agents copies your bash shell status\nand then it shows your bash shell status\nline at the bottom.\nUh I think you just\n>> Oh, I supposed to\n>> Yeah.\n>> run.\n>> I think after a while would have come\nback and and tried to run it.\n>> You're auto compact. I have set that\noff.\n[snorts]\n>> Yeah, that's\n>> okay. So that's what did I just run\nthere? you wanted to do status line but\nlet not do that. Um so basically some\nagents are in there the explore agent\nfrom uses haiku to quickly go through\nall of the paths and make a summary of\nwhat's inside your repository. Um that's\nwhat sometimes I guess that's what it\nuses when you do your initial in it. It\nwill use the explore agent to quickly\nfind the data so not to waste money on\nSunday or things like that, right? And\nthen it has the um planning agent which\nwhen you ask it to go into plan mode, it\nwill maybe spawn an explorer and then it\nwill spawn a plan agent to build um look\nit gives it the context and it says like\nI have to do this thing. It's very\ninteresting because when you when you do\ncontrol O you see the actual prompt that\nit sends to the SP planning agent. So\nit's interesting to see I've been trying\nto leverage agents and spend them spawn\nthem the way that you've done but like\nwhat you've done with the GitHub CLI\nagent is really nice. I mean that's a\nreally good good use and you I'm happy\nfor you worked out because when I tried\nit it was a disaster. [gasps]\nUm and then skills. So I have a very\nvery very funny experience. um with\nskills.\n>> Okay. I'm I'm I'm trying to describe\njust to capture. Yeah, you're welcome to\nadd screenshots and other things to this\nexcal.\n>> I'm sure if I can, but basically what\nhappened was this. I um I spent like\nclose to $15\npretty much my whole monthly budget on\nOpus to generate a really extensive plan\num of a feature that I'm working on. And\nthen I was like, \"Okay, I I can't use\nmore than that, like because I'm I'm\nover budget.\"\n>> I I still don't understand how you can\nspend $50 like that. Okay, carry on.\n>> 15.\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> On API calls on Opus 4.5. And so I went\nto to say to to anti-gravity and asked\nit like okay here's a very extensive\nplan and here's the prompt that speckit\nprovides. It's a very detailed prompt\nlike do this, do this, read the\nresearch, read the plan and start\ngenerating tasks. Right? So I told you\nthat I I switched all of the prompts to\nuse uh beads to to create uh tasks\ninstead of generating a long markdown\nbecause then it gets lost when it needs\nto do the work and it basically dies as\nsoon as it tries to read the number of\ntasks it need to do and try to figure\nout what it has to complete. So beats\ndoes help me there. I do think it really\nhelps me to to create very focused\nsessions. Um, so I asked Gemini to with\nthe prompt that works really well with\nSonet and it did an absolutely horrible\njob. It created every single issue with\njust a title and a oneline description.\nNow the idea is that you can just read\nthat one task and you can just go off\nand do what you need to do. So that task\nneeds to have information about which\nfile to change, what to change, why to\nchange it, acceptance criteria,\nreferences to the plan and the research.\nI mean surely you could change to happen\n>> instructed it to keep to some sort of\ntemplate.\n>> Yeah. So that's the prompt, right?\nThat's the prompt I gave it. I gave both\nSon and Okay. So basically you told it\nto do it, but it it ended up just doing\none line\n>> and it did one line and I was like, how\nis it possible? How come Son 4.5 is so\nmuch better than Gemini 3, which is\nsupposed to be like the premier model\nright now from Google? And of course,\nwe're talking about skills, you can\nguess, I have a beat skill that I\ncompletely forgot about. So even though\nmy prompt was identical and it only\nshowed like use beats, create a task\nlike this.\n>> Oh, so that you're saying that the beads\nthe beads prompt messed up the the\nprocess or something or what? What I'm\nsaying is that son has an agent skill\ncapability where it like progressively\nlearns how to use beats and my prompt\nwas identical but behind the scenes\nwithin the shell environment or however\nthe cloud code is built because it's\nclosed source somehow son creates very\ndetailed issues and maybe I can share my\nscreen actually.\n>> Yeah, sure. I'm curious.\n>> Okay, so basically Claude came up\nClaude won because of of beads and\nknowing the stuff. Okay. But that still\ndoesn't explain why Gemini did these\noneline things, but anyway.\n>> Okay, I can I can explain it. I actually\nsent you a detailed video about\n>> Oh, yeah. Actually, I haven't read your\nchat very closely. Let me just read it\nnow.\n>> Uh,\nphone a farmer.\nThat's uh apparently a Belgian dude that\nworks for Austra that um is one of the\nlike original Gatsby developers and he's\none of the early\nhe's Belgian and he he he's like the\nfirst far farmer founder\nmembers of of Mastra and Master is a\nreally interesting um TypeScript only\nframework to build agent workflows. So,\nit's a really cool uh framework that I\nthat I did a conference talk about uh\nback in March. So, you can\n>> Oh, by the way, are you going to be in\nBelgium soon because there's a there's a\ngood conference at the end of the year\nor the new year.\n>> I I I was telling so so I went to\nSingapore three times and I went to\nKoala Lumpur and I was telling my wife,\nlet me up for conferences and I was\ntelling I'm going to Belgium in in\nJanuary or um and then she was look the\nlook she gave me I I knew there was no\nway. [laughter]\n>> [ __ ] Okay. When was the last time you\nwere in Belgium then?\n>> Almost. I don't know. Um I can here.\nThis is Beats. [laughter]\n>> Okay. Let's\n>> distracting me. Okay. So So this\n>> Yeah. So this is a a cheap Beats UI.\nIt's pretty cool actually.\n>> Was this your UI cuz you one?\n>> I started coding.\n>> Um this one. So there's a discussion on\nBeats where they talked about different\nUIs. It's out of scope for the project\nbecause they don't want to pollute it.\nIt's a beats is meant to be a CLI text\nfocused tool for agents to use. UI is\nout of scope and it's hard to maintain\nand puts with maintenance. So they\ncompletely separate the beats UIs.\nTherefore, there's quite a few of them.\n>> This one is actually quite actively\nmaintained. I've\n>> Yeah. Anyway, um so it keeps track of\nall of the issues. It works directly\nwith the beat socket, so it's pretty\nfast. Um the way I've instructed it to\nuse beats in my task generation is to\ncreate epics for my big features and\nthen to create sub like features for the\nuser stories. So I get these nice flows\nof like these are my two features I need\nthat I that I was working on and and\nhere I have like the different phases.\nSo this is what opus generated.\n>> No, this is what Gemini generated. I\nmean, if we're going to compare that to\nthis, which is way more in line with the\nactual prompt, which is like user story\none, user story 2, and and when you look\nat them, you have the graph and\ndependencies.\n>> Oh, man. This makes me this is so much\nfaster than Jira. I could cry.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]\n>> I mean, Jira is so bad.\n>> Yes. So, so this is one of the use the\nthe story that um the the user story\ncaptured by Gemini, right? oneline\ndescription automatically generate and\nthen in the dependencies are all the\ntasks that belong to this user story. So\none of these like for example this one\nwas generated by Gemini which uh in the\noverview we can see it's just like oh\nadd this um Golang packet library to to\nautomatically infer this the JSON schema\nfrom JSON data sample\n>> uh add this into a new infer service\ninto internal. It doesn't even say like\nit's part of the grid API because this\nrepository has many different things.\nSo, so this is absolutely disgusting. If\nI want to give this to Haiku, it's going\nto completely it's going to go bonkers\nand and completely mess up my code,\nright? Um,\n>> so this is one of created and then this\nI show you the other one now created by\num\nby like this one for example is created\nby Son. Oh no, this one is\n>> you need you need to you need to add a\nlabel that is created by um\nNo.\n>> Gemini or so many or um where is it?\n>> Yeah. Can you can you alter your\nintegration skill?\n>> Make sure you label which which model\nput this thing in.\n>> That's actually not a bad idea because\nthere's the author part here and I can\nsee sometimes cloud puts itself as the\nassigne and that actually keeps it like\nnice to see. Um but integrate inference\ninto state upload update proto\ndefinitions update goal schema is that\nokay this is so in the video I sent you\nI cut out all of the me searching which\none was created by which model uh and\nit's really neat like the difference but\nhere you can see the difference right\nthis is how I want an issue to look like\nwhich is update the go SDK schema uh\nsource field um so that it lives here\nright um this is the description then\nthis is another flag that beat says to\ndesign right this is the changes you\nneed to make there's some notes um which\nhasn't had any notes and then there's\nthe acceptance criteria output key um is\nlike this this is the the final result\nand this is kind of like what I want\nlike the big planner model opus\ngenerates this type of design and then I\nwant to give it to like a very fast and\ndumb model and if they are not if they\nare not going outside and too creative\nthen hiku normally would end up with\nexactly to the spec and then I would be\nable to like everything would perfectly\nCool. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\nThat's a really good optimization. So,\njust to replay my understanding, you you\nget Opus to plan everything, put\neverything in beads as as task and then\nyou then you spin out haiku agents to\nimplement it.\n>> Yeah. So, beads beats allows models to\nfocus on the tasks and then you can kill\na session and you can just spin up a new\none, tell it to read this is your work.\nYou need this is your scope right here\nand then it goes off and does that\nthing, right? Right. And it keeps\n>> cool. So, how do you\n>> So, how come Gemini was so horrible at\nit, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Um, so in anti-gravity, this was\nactually the output from Gemini. Um,\n>> it's just anti-gravity right here.\n>> Yeah, this is anti-gravity.\n>> So, it's just exactly like VS Code, I\nguess.\n>> Yeah, they're all VS Code clones. They\n>> um\n>> I your animal I can't believe you have\nmini map.\n>> That That's how I judge people.\n>> Mini Map is great. I use it all the time\nto scroll. Whenever I see an error, I\njust click on it and then I'm right\nthere. I see it. It's really nice the\ncolor coding of it. Yeah, I really like\nit.\n>> Okay. Um I don't like mini.\n>> So this is the speckit. This is the\nspecket task um that you you need to\ngive in anti-gravity. Again, you see how\nmany stupid folders I have. I have\nGemini, I have codeex, I have cloud, and\nnow I have to add another one for\nagent/workflows because that's what\nanti-gravity uses. And they're all the\nsame. They're all exactly the same. Now\nthe problem is here when I say like this\nis how you use CLI calls. This is how\nyou create a feature an epic right? This\nis how you create a user story. Um and\nyou add the specs like this and this is\nthe face.\n>> Okay. So you're templating a little bit.\n>> Yeah. But as you can see the only thing\nI say is you give it a title, you give\nit a description and nothing else. And I\nwas like huh. So maybe this is my\nproblem. How did I have a difference\nwith what I give son? And I go to son\nand it's exactly the same. You just give\nit a description and there's no\ninformation about giving it design notes\nor acceptance criteria, right? So,\n>> okay. So, it must have pulled out some\ncontext from your from your user profile\nor something.\n>> Yeah. So, so you put\nyou put this uh under my home directory.\nI don't know if you can see it in the\nterminal.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Claude. Yeah. I'm I'm always\non on I'd like to keep everything on a\nproject level. I hate to put things in\nmy home directory. I absolutely agree\nwith you because I want to check this\ninto to git so if anyone pulls it down\nthey can get the exact same experience\nright uh but anyway this is how\napparently when I installed this is how\nskills worked I don't know if right now\nyou can do it at the project level for\nskills but issue creation is here\n>> nice\n>> and issue creation is very detailed\n>> design fields acceptance criteria\n>> yeah this is so good\n>> oh my god I did I completely forgot\nabout it right and and and So I I didn't\neven know like that.\n>> So mystery solved, right? So be so\nGemini is not that bad.\n>> You can't be blamed.\n>> So at that point I think Gemini my first\nintuition was like Gemini is really good\nat following the instructions because\nanother thing that's different between\nthe two is that here they are perfectly\nlike this. Use a story colon and then\nthe name. But I also just noticed now\nwhen we're talking about it here it's\nlike phase 2 phase B to B. Why is it so\ndifferent?\num why are they not like following the\nsame? Because if I look at at um any\nother issues in the um epics in the\nback. So this is some problem with this\nthis uh this this UI. I can't go back to\nthe old epics to show you how they\nlooked. Once they're closed, they're not\nhere anymore. Um also I can't show you\nthe comments. Um so on a lot of these I\nsolved it by letting Sony add comments\nwith missing design documents. Uh but\nyeah, so now I just noticed as well that\nI actually give it the sample is like\nthis, right? It's like face setup.\nActually, it is like this story US1.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> So, it does put the story on it, but\nYeah.\n>> Well, this is cool. I [snorts]\n>> Oh, man. I I just love that that I need\nto sync my work Jira into Beads or\nsomething. I did see someone developed a\nplugin or something. So,\n>> I'm I'm like I think 10 versions behind\nBeats by now, right? Because this thing\nmoves so fast. Um, and then when I look\nat the change logs, it's like um new\nfeature, then two two commits later or\nnew release with fix and revert. And\nthen I see commits like um\nfix uh like corrupt data issue. And I\nwas like, okay, I don't want to update\n[laughter] cuz it's like it works.\nIt's moving too fast. I don't want to\nlike spend a day to move to a new\nversion. And then also I have to make\nsure my skills updated. I have to make\nsure my templates are updated with the\nright. It's such a cool time right now.\nSo like I wanted to maybe just touch on\num\non I mean we we are early adopters.\nIs the rest of I was just curious to ask\nif the rest of your company or your your\nteam is is using the same stuff as you\nor or it's not not not yet really.\n>> So this is where we talk. So last time\nyou one thing you mentioned to me was\nSteve Jagger's talk at the summit where\nhe mentioned about people that do not\nadopt AI significantly have a\ndisadvantage and there's a big problem\nin open AI where um they don't know how\nto do the reviews because they cannot\ncompare somebody that does use AI\nagainst somebody who does not use AI and\nyou hate and I watch\n>> I don't know if you noticed that that\nClaude also published this like paper on\nproductivity gains\n>> you shared it with me as well. Yeah,\n>> it was I think it was quite a big number\nlike speeds up individual tasks by 80%.\nI mean that's\n>> the thing is one of the first lines in\nthe in this paper is like we asked Sonet\nto analyze and Sony came up with these\nhypothetical [laughter] goals and I'm\nlike\n>> we as we asked Sonet to analyze the\nproductivity gains of Sonet.\n>> Yeah. I mean like one of the things I\nalways get from son is like it's going\nto take 3 4 days to build this thing or\none of like two weeks and so on. Um\n>> well you asked it to estimate.\n>> No I don't ask it every single time you\nask it to plan. May maybe it's in my\nspec kit prompts again right I'm using\nthese tools I don't know\n>> okay your context is polluted then more\nthan mine at least.\n>> Well it's it's been effective. Um but\nbut it's kind of funny because another\nthing that happens since we spoke is\nthe research preview of cloud code web\nran out and on on Sunday, right? So I\nhad like we spoke maybe on Tuesday and I\nhad like a week to and I only I was\nliterally rushing. So in to maximize the\nuse. So usually I use specit right I I\nbuild out these big plans. So, I went to\nthe cloud code web research preview and\non the mobile app while I'm at, you\nknow, um a restaurant to watch the F1 uh\nLas Vegas. I was on my phone uh specking\nout a feature for my project in cloud\ncode uh web uh or actually on the on the\nmobile app and and and and there's no\nspecit there's no beats in that\nenvironment, right? It's a very sandbox.\nSo how how the hell were you doing that?\nit kind of what I wanted to to say was\nlike without specit without all of this\nlike what you just said context polluted\nthings just give the tool in its like\nnatural environment and I think that\nthey were triing opus in this\nenvironment too to be honest um they\nthey tell everyone here's $250 give it\nsome task we control the environment and\nwe'll see how son and you know how they\ndo trials right so so it gave me really\ngood results um so Then\nI wanted to adopt this one because this\none is quite significant right I want to\nbasically what I'm working on is on the\nterraform state management whenever you\ndo terapform apply and you have some\noutputs I want to capture a schema\naround those outputs so it will it will\nstore a JSON schema so if you're\nbuilding some other infrastructure\nsomewhere else you can pull down that\nJSON schema from the other state and you\ncan code against that because that's\nwhat you can expect that the outputs\nwill look like and and it will also\nchange right if if the if the output\nschema changes it will it will flag it\nit will say like yeah the values change\nyou need to replan but not only that the\nschema changed so you may may have like\ncomplete breakage when you consume these\noutputs right so so it's a quite a big\nfeatures with a lot of um capabilities\nin there so the initial thing that I\nasked while I was in in uh watching F1 I\nasked chat GPT like I've got this API um\nI want to do like I want people to be\nable to register the shape of those\noutputs. Um, my primary library is in\nTypescript and they have these\ndefinition files and TypeScript is a\ngreat language to defining schemas. Um,\nhowever, not everyone is using\nTypeScript. Um, and it would be annoying\nthat you have to define a TypeScript\ninterface. Um, although I like the the\nway of writing TypeScript is way more\nnicer than than defining JSON schema in\nmy opinion. Uh, but I thought maybe to\nkeep it simple, TypeScript can easily go\nto JSON schema. uh maybe there's some\nfidelity loss and not exactly the same\nbut you can go between them. So I\nthought like JSON schema seems like the\nbest option to go across languages cuz\nthen you can have JSON schema supporting\neverything Python um and everything. So\na little bit a little back and forth\nbetween me and open eye which is really\nmore like a rubber duck at that point\nright he just says yeah sure go with\nJason\n>> great you are great [laughter]\n>> absolutely also shadow conspiracy\nanyway um so so so that was the first\nstep right uh identifying how uh like\nwhat how do we capture the schema um and\nthis this whole inference thing wasn't a\nthing I was just like I want to give\npeople the ability to just post like an\nendpoint to post what the output shape\nwill be like and and then we can look at\nlike validating it right so but there's\nI was thinking to myself this is so\ncomplicated for 100% there's 100 like\nedge cases and scenarios that I'm not\ntaking into account but I think that's\nwhat's great about Sonet um and this is\none of the things that I shared in a\nvideo with you as well is that I ask son\nto do these things in a web console you\nknow using my phone with a very basic\ndescription um and it gives me prompting\nwhich kind of works. Um but then what\nhappened is when I got home I was like\nit only implemented half of it. For\nexample, it didn't do the schema\nvalidation part. It it it give the\nendpoint for people to post the schema\nbut it didn't give an like ability to\nwhen you do Terraform apply it doesn't\ntrack if the schema validation is is is\nstill valid for those outputs. So I was\nlike oh that's missing. Um and so I\ndecided that I wanted to adopt this\nbranch created by cloud code with\nspecit. So I I I wrote a special prompt\nlike and modify all the scripts which is\nlike this this branch was created\noutside of specit\nlook at all of the existing work that\nhas been done and then create a a\nfeature like description and then also I\nasked Opus to review it from like an\ninfrastructure um you know consultant\nengineer uh what are the day two\noperations that you know may be issues.\nFor example, we we designed the feature\nto track the JSON schema per state per\noutput. But I'm like, \"Yeah, but the\nnetwork goes from defaf to prod. So the\nschema should be the same. So why do I\nattach the schema to the state output?\"\nAnd um and he's like, \"Yeah, absolutely.\nBut I [laughter]\nI'm always like the devil's advocate.\nI'm going to tell it we should make it\nglobal.\" And he was like,\n>> \"Yeah.\" Okay. So just just to summarize\nwhat you were saying to me is that\n>> is that\n>> you were you watching F1 you're on\nclaude code mobile you you you developed\nsome ideas opus or son shows that it's\nmuch better\n>> and then you were able to adopt it in\nyour your spec kit flow that your b your\nmobile session effectively right\n>> yeah yeah yeah um I was able to clone\nthe branch adopt it with the speech\nworkflow that goes in through detailed\nuser story and edge case analysis and\nthen identifies what was done and wasn't\nisn't done high priority to\n>> I mean I'm trying I'm trying to find\nreasons not to use my mobile but yeah\nokay awesome awesome\n>> yeah um but yeah\n>> I wanted to quickly ask since you you're\nshowing the beads UI here\nlike\none thing\none thing I don't have good visibility\nof which is which is of course why\nproject managers love to look at Jira or\num Pivotal or whatever the those things\nare called. How quickly are you munching\nthrough these tasks? Do you have a\nvelocity or something like that? Like\nhow do you measure?\n>> I really like beats in the way that it\ntries to capture it tries to be a local\nJira. It gives you stats. It gives you\nrundown. And it gives you a chart.\nThere's a whole bunch. Yeah, there is BT\nstats. Yes, it it tells you how long is\ninitial.\n>> Can Can you show me some stats?\n>> Yeah, but like like I said, I've used\nCloud Code web for a while, so Oh, it's\nnot going to be here. Hold on.\n>> Oh, yeah. I think I'd noticed the BD\nstats command, but I'm\n>> There is a BD stat using it in anger\nyet. [snorts]\n>> Oh, I I need to get my prompt to do a\ncarriage return like yours.\n>> Yeah, there's the average lead time.\nWhat does what does that mean? That\nmeans it takes uh 60 hours for something\nto get done or what does that mean?\n>> Yeah. Um don't ask me because I don't\nuse these. But your question was are\nthere stats and there are um there are\nrelated to to hours and time because it\nkeeps track of when an issue was created\nand when an issue was closed um and\nthings like that. Um it has quite a lot\nof things like what you would expect.\nThis is why when I was talking to you\nabout building a UI for this is like I\nkind of was inspired by Trello, right?\nBecause you have these little cards, you\nhave the labels, you have the comments,\nyou have\n>> what?\n>> Travel.\n>> Inspired by\n>> Trello. Trello. You mean Trello, right?\n>> Trello that was acquired.\n>> Yeah. Like a camb board or whatever.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. Which was acquired by Atlassian\nunfortunately.\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> But that that's super cool. Um, I\nbasically at the back of my mind during\nour conversation, I'm I'm I'm just\nthinking about the the human aspect\nbecause I feel supercharged by AI. Um,\nbut I'm just thinking like, you know, in\nin a corporate environment,\nhow does this work with team members?\nHow do you\n>> Yeah.\n>> rationalize the productivity? How do you\ntrain people? All these things are just\nfloating in my mind right now. That's\nwhat you were asking earlier and I\ndiverted to the talk from Steve Yagi\nabout um about how\n>> Oh yeah, like senior staff engineers. I\nlove that.\n>> And what happened was the craftsman were\ndoing the same thing our staff engineers\nare doing today.\n>> No,\nthat's word for word, right? That's what\nthey say.\n>> I love that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then he say word\nfor word.\n>> Word for word, by the way. And the whole\nroom left. But then uh Jean Kim also\ntalked about you know the Dora reports\nand and the work they do there where\nthey um identified and significant I\nthink the Dora report did say that there\nwasn't like a performance improvement\nbut one of the things that he\nhighlighted and I think was very\nrelevant to the talk that we had last\ntime which is that AI usage is a skill\nthat you become more confident in the\nmore you use it. Yeah,\n>> right.\n>> When you never used it, you're going to\nuse an LLM. You're not really familiar\nwith how to prompt it. It's going to\ngive you something that looks good, but\nwhen you poke through it, it's actually\ngarbage and you're immedately going to\nuse the trust,\n>> but you don't know how to validate it.\n>> It definitely rewards people who spend\ntime using it. Like I I was going to say\nthat like what you were doing by trying\ndifferent models,\n>> by using work trees to try the things\nthat that Theo is doing, like the more\nyou do that, the more you you almost\nresurrect an old project and just try\nagain.\n>> I really think it's\n>> the more you're going to learn, right?\nThe more investment in time. It's it's\nreally changing the workflow of a\nsoftware engineer.\n>> Um\ncrazy\n>> way more towards review part which I\nalways thought was a great part of it\nthough. Um I had this\n>> well you say review but I'm I think more\nlike it's more of like an orchestration\nthing. I feel like it's a pipeline like\nyou got to go back or you\n>> it's both of them\n>> both you need to know how to prompt and\nfeed the information and keep the\ncontext st so that it can be focused and\ndelivers a task. Although that the tools\nwill more and more be better at that\nbecause right now Opus is doing a lot of\nthings like automatically compacting\ntool finding the tools relevant and\nexecuting them correctly which is less\nand less on you and more on the tool\nright but on the other side so you need\nto orchestrate it but you need to be\nable to capture the requirements\nfine-tune them and um you know review\nbasically review what the model is\ntelling you are the usea user stories\nreviewing what the edge cases are\nscoping it down making sure that is like\nthat's acceptable for what I'm trying to\ndeliver um you know talking to your um\nstakeholders to make sure that we are\nokay with like it working this way and\nnot doing that part cuz that's going to\nbe and that's one thing I really liked\nabout Opus cuz after I had it like\ngenerate all of the things I I give it a\nI should have saved the prompt which is\nlike okay look look for sentences that\nlook simple on paper but have a huge\nimplication in terms of complexity that\nthey add and I give an example which is\nlike one of the sentences that the model\nloves to loves to put in these\nrequirements is like make sure that the\nuser that the error messages are very\ndetailed about what's going wrong and\nthat the user knows like how to react\nand and work on the error message,\nright? It sounds great. Yeah, actually\nsounds great. And then you get to the\nimplementation part or you do a review\nand then I use another model to do the\nreview and it keeps tripping up on this.\nIt's like this is not clear like what\ndoes it mean? What is what is an\nactionable error message? and and it\ngoes crazy and then you have to like and\nand and I basically asked it and in this\ncase, right, this is this is kind of MVP\nand I'm okay with the with the error\nmessage just being a log in the server\nand and just being like a red bar basic\nuh feedback that's didn't work. Um and\nand then Opus went through all of the\nspecs and immediately highlighted like\nfive six cases where this is kind of\nlike overkill for an MVP. this is kind\nof like this might be really have big\nimplications uh in terms of like yeah I\nI love that one um you know because\nthat's my biggest problem like scoping\ndown these models um so that's the first\npart right being able to to to control\nthe context keep the\n>> I still don't actually understand how\nyou can bugger off for for five you know\nlike weeks ago I think you maybe\nexaggerating like you just get some some\nyour your tasks together and then you go\nto the gym for 5 hours and then you come\nback and the work is done like I mean\nthat doesn't how that doesn't sound\nexaggerating uh that was about one\nfeature which is adding labels to\nterraform state and then giving a query\nengine to be able to query the labels\nright and I spent two days on going\nthrough the specs and the user stories\nand selecting the Golang library that\nallowed you to build expressions for\nthose labels and and it's kind of a\nsmall scope compare that to building a\nwhole authentication system with OIDC\nand and and keep\nRight. So, so I kind of didn't realize\nhow how very scoped and narrow that\nparticular story that I gave you was\nbecause I I felt like\n>> I guess\n>> I I I got a I get a I got a little bit\nobsessed. Well, I I was captivated by by\nthis whole idea that you can walk away\nfrom the computer and it's doing work\nfor you while you're asleep or\nsomething. But I think in practice that\ndoesn't is not really the case because\nyou know models and agents are getting\nfaster and faster. It's it's all the\nblock. It's not it's there's no real\noptimization there. The optimization is\npurely in your prompting, your workflow,\nyour review.\n>> Yeah. So, so I I I do always tend to\nwalk away when I see that the model has\nkind of kicked off in a loop and is kind\nof working on things and I don't want to\nsit here and just watch it at that point\nwhen I'm kind of sure that it's it's\nokay. So, I I walk away from my machine\na lot more and I decide that I'm going\nto go to the gym and I'm gone for an\nhour and I come back. I don't know how\nlong it ran, right? But it pretty much\ngot to a state where it was like, \"Oh,\nI'm approaching context limits. Let me\nsummarize and and see what I've done.\"\nUm, and things like that. So,\n>> I mean, you must go also yolo because\nwhen I when I was running that agent\nthing, it kept on asking me for prompts,\nyou know, all throughout the session.\nAnnoyingly,\n>> it permission. uh\n>> modals, right?\n>> So funny, I never had it delete my home\nuser directory. I've never had it like\nget hard reset anything. I don't give it\naccess to any databases. Um so I've\nhaven't had those issues.\n>> But I've noticed that the CLI prompts\nnow like when I go into codeex and you\ngo to approvals and you go to like give\nit full access in codeex before it was\nlike oh okay you give me full access\ngreat. Now it goes like are you sure it\nmay completely destroy your machine? Are\nyou sure you want to do this? I'm like,\nwhoa, whoa, you're scaring me now.\nBefore it was just okay, but I guess\n>> go going back to Jean Kim, I just\nnoticed I have a book by by Jean Kim\nright next to me. This the Accelerate\nbook. Accelerate.\n>> I don't know if you read that one. I\nmean, Jean Kim is a a legend. So, so\njust just to repeat what you said that\nJean Kim said, to be honest, I didn't\nwatch Jean Kim's presentation. So he's\nsaying that the more time\n>> people like us spend spend with working\nout working on these things, the more\n>> the more they trust it.\n>> Yeah. Well, it's not so much trust. It's\nmore it's the more\n>> he says trust\n>> comp competent we get too I suppose\n>> I guess but it's more also about like\nletting like trusting what it's doing.\nIt's okay knowing where to look for what\nyou know are like the areas where it\nwill mess up.\n>> Yeah. I guess trust trust is a bit is a\nbit wishy-washy, isn't it? It's not it's\na bit\n>> I think it's a great word because\nbecause if you don't trust something,\n>> you know the the quote trust but verify,\nbut if you if you don't trust something,\nyou're going to really go into very deep\ndetails verifying like every single line\nof code. Um whereas at this point I'm\nlike I'm verifying the integration\ntests. I have a couple of layering rules\nthat I define like do not create a\ndirect dependency between the repository\nand the uh HTTP handler. Make sure that\nyou go through a service layer and the\nservice layer is used by HTTP because\nwe're using the services in many areas\nnot just the handlers and things like\nthat. So, so more and like those\nlayering type of things and those scary\nrefactors to be honest because like I\nknow that unit tests were working but\nthen now I suddenly have to completely\nbreak down all the folders and and do\nall of the logic all over the place.\n>> Oh, sorry. My my wife has just messaged\nme. I need to to help her out with the\nkids.\n>> Okay.\n>> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Emergency.\nEmergency.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:00] Cool, man. That's I'm just trying to\n[0:02] think of what we spoke last week so we\n[0:04] don't sound like broken records\n[0:06] repeating ourselves about\n[0:08] >> last week. Gemini just came out. Um\n[0:11] >> I just rewatched it before this call\n[0:14] >> and we talked. Um\n[0:16] >> yeah, but no, I forgot everything. Yeah,\n[0:17] I I mentioned that I got some good time\n[0:20] in on anti-gravity, the new\n[0:24] IDE that Google launched.\n[0:25] >> I haven't I haven't tried that.\n[0:28] Oh man, I I'm going to\n[0:30] >> Yeah, I guess I guess we were I I think\n[0:33] we're we're both anthropic Claude fans,\n[0:37] aren't we?\n[0:38] >> And guess who else since 20 hours ago\n[0:42] said he is a fan who is a massive\n[0:46] antiropic dude. quite famous\n[0:49] >> andropic who\n[0:52] >> T3 G3\n[0:56] >> also Theo is like every time he posts a\n[0:59] video for a while on Reddit people would\n[1:00] be like he's obviously an open AI shell\n[1:03] he gets private access to some of their\n[1:05] um models and um and and and basically\n[1:09] people he will never say anything\n[1:11] positive about Antropic he hates\n[1:13] Antropic um but he did a video was\n[1:17] Uh,\n[1:19] it was\n[1:21] >> Let maybe share your screen.\n[1:24] >> Okay.\n[1:25] >> I do watch a fair few Theo videos, but\n[1:27] to be honest, I don't subscribe cuz he's\n[1:30] one of those. It's like like Primogen\n[1:32] and Theo. Their content is good, but I\n[1:35] do find it like a bit too much actually.\n[1:39] For some reason, I I feel like only\n[1:41] dipping in when I want to.\n[1:43] >> You see it? So\n[1:47] we talked about AI for infrastructure\n[1:49] engineers.\n[1:50] >> Oh yeah,\n[1:50] >> that's subscribe.\n[1:53] >> But there was um I am subscribed. No,\n[1:57] >> I don't know.\n[1:58] >> And there was um\n[2:02] I was going to I was hoping that the\n[2:03] title would ring me a few more bells,\n[2:05] but I also rewatched what we discussed\n[2:07] about based infrastructure a little bit.\n[2:09] But basically this was posted.\n[2:12] Um\n[2:14] I tried to open it in a\n[2:17] new window.\n[2:21] >> Not what I wanted to do.\n[2:22] >> Oh my god. You don't have premium.\n[2:25] >> Uh no. Why would I pay?\n[2:27] >> You're an animal.\n[2:29] >> Where's the\n[2:31] >> It's not this one. This one is about\n[2:32] opening eye. This one.\n[2:34] >> I have a new favorite model.\n[2:35] >> How many hours ago? 22 hours ago. So\n[2:38] little.\n[2:38] >> Oh, he's he is\n[2:42] he\n[2:43] >> is this some sort of ironic?\n[2:45] >> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He he goes\n[2:47] into great detail. Surprisingly has a\n[2:49] lot of benchmarks. He does a very\n[2:51] interesting demonstrations comparing the\n[2:53] output of different models. He says Opus\n[2:56] 4.5 got massive boost in UI generation,\n[3:00] that the entropic models generally were\n[3:02] not good at that originally, um, but\n[3:04] that it's really much better at it right\n[3:07] now. So he has this um snitchbench\n[3:10] repository and he uses cursor with git\n[3:13] work trees and he says in this video\n[3:14] five times that get work trees are not\n[3:16] working in cursor and that they're\n[3:18] working on it but it makes his life a\n[3:20] living hell and every time he talks\n[3:22] about his workflow he mentions work\n[3:24] trees and how they're broken. It's\n[3:26] really um anyway\n[3:27] >> yeah I mean there's some things about\n[3:29] git that I've never really enjoyed like\n[3:31] subm modules and things like that. Oh,\n[3:33] some modules stay away from, right? But\n[3:35] git works sound like very interesting in\n[3:37] the age of AI where you can just spin\n[3:39] off a branch in a different subdirectory\n[3:42] and have like a PC quickly, you know,\n[3:45] developed by\n[3:46] >> you need it, don't you? You need it.\n[3:48] Yeah, even speckit idea is also to like\n[3:52] define the specification and spin off in\n[3:55] implementation\n[3:57] um and so that you can do different PC's\n[3:59] like maybe you have the user stories and\n[4:00] functional requirements but then you\n[4:02] implement it in like five different ways\n[4:04] and different technologies different.\n[4:06] >> So wait a minute I thought you were\n[4:07] saying that Theo was team open AI and\n[4:10] now he's anthropic.\n[4:13] He's yeah he he gets access and early\n[4:16] access to AI open AI and he does not get\n[4:19] any access and then when he talks about\n[4:21] it in this video he mentions like\n[4:23] there's a few other um\n[4:26] AI channels that are benchmarking models\n[4:29] that are also not getting early access\n[4:31] to the entropic models and he's happy to\n[4:33] be in the same boat as them. something\n[4:36] like Antropic is horrible. Um, but I've\n[4:40] got to give it to them. This opens 4.5\n[4:43] is insanely good. And\n[4:47] >> okay, sorry.\n[4:48] >> He als he he also ranks here. He talks\n[4:51] about the the output the UI output of\n[4:53] Opus and then he he gives his ranking\n[4:56] here of output ceiling versus\n[4:58] consistency and um he hasn't finished it\n[5:02] there. So, but to him he still says\n[5:04] yeah. What does output ceiling mean?\n[5:08] >> The best you can get out of it. Like\n[5:10] like sometimes you give it a prompt and\n[5:12] it gives like a really amazing output.\n[5:14] He says a couple of times GPT 5.1 Pro\n[5:18] really beat Gemini 3 um by a mile. And\n[5:22] then\n[5:24] the problem is the consistency\n[5:27] um that you get from these models is\n[5:30] nothing compared to open opus like oppus\n[5:33] and son they are very consistent. So\n[5:35] he's reranking them on the right saying\n[5:37] uh or left however is this mirrored? No\n[5:40] it's not mirrored. Um yeah [snorts]\n[5:43] anyway um but Gemini tree\n[5:47] I think last time we talked I mentioned\n[5:48] that I had very limited access to Gemini\n[5:51] tree because uh I used Google cloud code\n[5:55] assist uh licenses. I have a Google\n[5:57] cloud account. It's a personal one but\n[5:59] you can subscribe to um Gemini in GCP.\n[6:03] So you can run code assist and you can\n[6:06] then use it and you get access to like\n[6:08] the the Google cloud models but the way\n[6:11] that they release it to different\n[6:13] subscription plans is a little bit\n[6:15] different. So you can subscribe to\n[6:17] Gemini AI Pro or um and you can even get\n[6:21] like a massive promotion for 3 months or\n[6:24] so at half the price or whatever it was\n[6:26] to to use it to to that that Gemini\n[6:28] Gemini Gemini AI Pro subscription. But\n[6:32] for some reason to me it made more sense\n[6:34] given I already have my my billing\n[6:36] accounts in GCP to just use the the\n[6:38] seats there. I basically\n[6:40] >> was trying to see if I could use it.\n[6:42] Clicked for one month subscription\n[6:44] before I knew it. I realized that that\n[6:45] was probably not the best way to do it.\n[6:47] Uh figured out how to assign a seat\n[6:49] because they have users within Google\n[6:51] account Google cloud that you then have\n[6:52] to allocate to licenses. You can do that\n[6:54] automatically. So when you sign into\n[6:57] >> GCP is like project. So there's there's\n[6:59] a project concept and then and then then\n[7:01] there's a seed concept or something.\n[7:02] >> Yeah. So on one one side it's really\n[7:04] cool that you have so many ways to\n[7:06] authenticate and you can use an API key,\n[7:08] you can use the Gemini AI, you can use\n[7:10] this and that on the other side is they\n[7:12] are not consistent in the way that\n[7:14] they're giving the different\n[7:15] subscriptions access to the new models.\n[7:17] And so the only way I had access was\n[7:20] through the anti-gravity\n[7:23] uh IDE which is apparently just Windsor\n[7:25] rebranded because if you search for\n[7:27] strings they still have the original\n[7:28] Windsor strings in there apparently. But\n[7:30] anyway, so um so that's and there it's\n[7:33] free access so it's nerfed right because\n[7:36] um it's against my accounts but the the\n[7:39] availability of the model is constantly\n[7:41] like um to make sure my experience was\n[7:44] not unique and to have a bigger you know\n[7:47] background around benchmarking I watched\n[7:50] three or four videos as you can see from\n[7:52] my uh\n[7:53] >> from my my history around these latest\n[7:57] model announcements.\n[7:58] >> Right. Right.\n[8:01] >> So,\n[8:01] >> so my experience was horrible. Uh after\n[8:03] the first\n[8:04] >> for Gemini, you're saying, right?\n[8:06] >> Yeah. Yeah. After the first\n[8:07] >> Sorry, who who owns who owns Wind Surf\n[8:10] now? The earlier comment you made.\n[8:12] >> Okay. So there was a stream\n[8:16] >> there was a stream of like um also a\n[8:19] live stream just 20 hours ago from the\n[8:21] Mastra people which building AI\n[8:23] workflows and they went a little bit\n[8:24] into the drama of windsurf because\n[8:27] windsurf was like the startup um and I\n[8:30] think the CEO or founder was poached\n[8:34] away they were like negotiating a\n[8:36] contract with Google uh but then Google\n[8:39] didn't manage to acquire them afraid for\n[8:40] antitrust lawsuits or thing. So they\n[8:43] just took the CEO. He left his whole\n[8:45] team behind and all the IP.\n[8:49] So he joined Google within one one or\n[8:51] two months.\n[8:53] I don't know why. On the right my my\n[8:56] suggestions.\n[8:58] >> So basically when Surf went from like a\n[9:00] huge valuation to to the CEO being\n[9:03] poached. I guess that's kind of smart.\n[9:05] >> I know. horrible for the the early like\n[9:07] early team because all of these guys\n[9:09] probably gave up a good amount of their\n[9:12] life working full stop on this startup\n[9:15] and then the CEO just walks away with\n[9:16] all the IP and the company is still\n[9:18] there. They're still employed but it's\n[9:20] worth nothing or something like that.\n[9:23] >> Yeah. So everybody hates that CEO. I did\n[9:25] watch I did watch a like a hacker news Y\n[9:28] cominator interview with I think the CEO\n[9:31] of Windsurf and I did find it\n[9:33] interesting how the company started by\n[9:36] like I think they were doing like GPU\n[9:39] type of 3D gaming cloud stuff and then\n[9:43] they pivoted into uh to Windsurf.\n[9:48] >> Yeah. Um, so, so basically\n[9:53] they were saying that they got like 10\n[9:55] seconds of good use out of it. They\n[9:57] kicked off a plan and they immediately\n[9:59] got like 10 seconds after 10 seconds is\n[10:02] Gemini Tree just said, \"No, I'm\n[10:04] overloaded.\" Um, or uh you reach your\n[10:06] quota. Um, so for me, I feel like I got\n[10:09] a lot more out of Gemini tree initially.\n[10:12] Um but what really made my impression\n[10:15] bad over the last week is one that the\n[10:18] way for me to get access to it is\n[10:20] impossible. Um I have to go on a waiting\n[10:23] list but I haven't like received an\n[10:25] approval on the form to all go on the\n[10:27] waiting list. They have a question which\n[10:29] is like are you contributing to Gemini\n[10:30] CLI? I'm like no. So guess what you're\n[10:34] not going to get it. [laughter] I don't\n[10:35] know\n[10:36] >> why questions.\n[10:39] >> Why ask right? When I see that question,\n[10:41] I'm already like, \"Yeah, okay.\"\n[10:42] >> Okay,\n[10:43] >> I guess not then.\n[10:44] >> But then on the opposite, Opus released\n[10:46] was it yesterday for me? Like for me it\n[10:51] was yesterday. Was it for you yesterday?\n[10:53] Opus the announcement of Antropic was\n[10:56] yesterday, right?\n[10:57] >> I don't know. It was fading days of\n[10:59] fading. Maybe the day before yesterday,\n[11:00] but yeah,\n[11:01] >> it was like Monday, right? Today's\n[11:02] Wednesday. Yeah, it was like Monday\n[11:05] during the day and I woke up on Tuesday\n[11:07] and [snorts] I and it was released and\n[11:09] andropic\n[11:11] litm I mean made it so simple right in\n[11:14] cloud code you can go extra usage I mean\n[11:18] you can yeah you can go extra usage\n[11:22] and it will immediately throw you into\n[11:25] the into your account management your\n[11:27] billing [snorts] uh page and you can\n[11:29] just use your credit card because I'm\n[11:31] already a subscriber it already has my\n[11:33] billing um method there, right? So, I\n[11:35] can just click, okay, top up wallet and\n[11:38] I immediately have like I don't know, I\n[11:40] put in $30 uh equal to like a month\n[11:43] subscription, $13 and um and right away\n[11:47] I have access to Opus straight up. I can\n[11:50] just slash Oopus. There you go. 4.5.\n[11:52] Even though I pay $20 a month or $30 a\n[11:55] month in Singapore dollars\n[11:56] >> uh for just the pro subscription, I can\n[11:59] use OPUS, but it's API uh charges. That\n[12:04] means it's not like on your monthly uh\n[12:06] budget, you get charged by the call. And\n[12:09] I thought like it's supposedly much more\n[12:12] token efficient and therefore they say\n[12:14] in terms of cost, it's almost similar to\n[12:18] SA 4.5. That's what you get when you are\n[12:20] a Max Pro user. They say when you're Max\n[12:23] Pro, you use Opus. They slashed it by\n[12:25] like a third the price. So that's one of\n[12:26] the things T3 mentioned and Tropic\n[12:29] sliced the price like crazy. So first\n[12:31] they made Opus 4.1 completely useless\n[12:34] and forced everyone to use Sony 4.5 and\n[12:37] then\n[12:39] everyone saying they were sitting on\n[12:41] this model until Gemini came out and\n[12:44] then the next week they released 4.5.\n[12:46] >> Oh, nice. Yeah. So they can move\n[12:47] quickly. Hey, can I just can I just\n[12:50] share my screen here?\n[12:52] >> Yeah, sure. Sure. Um,\n[12:53] >> so I'm a little bit puzzled by the way\n[12:55] things work. Like I I got access to\n[12:59] Claude Opus through Gemini. I mean,\n[13:03] sorry, through co-pilot\n[13:06] pretty quickly. You can see my screen,\n[13:08] right?\n[13:10] >> You use Yeah, Visual Studio. No, I don't\n[13:12] think I see your screen. Sorry.\n[13:14] >> You don't? Oh, god. I\n[13:17] >> [clears throat]\n[13:21] >> Um,\n[13:26] you don't see it at all, do you?\n[13:29] Okay. May maybe let me just try share\n[13:31] again.\n[13:31] >> Did you click the button?\n[13:32] >> Yeah, it says I'm screen sharing.\n[13:35] >> Now I see your link shared inside the\n[13:38] chat. You're trying to share Excalibraw.\n[13:42] >> Yeah.\n[13:43] >> Oh, now I can see it.\n[13:44] >> Okay. So,\n[13:46] so like, okay, let's let's we can\n[13:50] annotate this with some. So, so Gemini\n[13:53] 3. Oh, no. That's too that's too big.\n[13:56] So, Gemini 3 came out.\n[14:00] I got that. They charge 1x and then of\n[14:03] course uh Opus got released like a\n[14:06] couple of days later.\n[14:10] I thought Opus was the was the, you\n[14:13] know, the the the clever big thinking\n[14:16] one. How come?\n[14:19] >> So, basically, Haiku is now,\n[14:22] if I understand that, cheaper, right? Or\n[14:25] I think that is it.\n[14:26] >> Haiku. Haiku was super cheap. Yeah, I\n[14:30] think this is promotional because and\n[14:32] it's preview because I don't think I I\n[14:34] don't think Opus would be the same as\n[14:36] Sony 4.5. It's still more than so son\n[14:39] 4.5. Haiku is the cheap you know like in\n[14:42] pros haiku is a very short um body of\n[14:46] text. Son is longer and then opus is\n[14:49] your like your big life.\n[14:50] >> Yeah.\n[14:51] >> So uh I just I just think it's a bit\n[14:53] curious the way that they've presented\n[14:55] it here. Like I'm I mean credit to VS\n[14:58] Code for even showing these clawed\n[15:00] options very well. Like I know I know\n[15:03] that the GPT\n[15:06] you know open AI is owned by Microsoft\n[15:08] VS code is Microsoft they do show their\n[15:11] their own mod models first for some\n[15:14] reason they throw in gro I I don't know\n[15:16] why I don't even know know what Raptor\n[15:18] is\n[15:20] >> do you know what that is\n[15:22] >> no\n[15:23] preview\n[15:26] it's just a curious state of affairs my\n[15:29] VS code manage models uh dialogue.\n[15:35] So, did have you tried Opus? Like, do\n[15:38] you agree with what Theo said? Is it all\n[15:42] hunky dory? There's no controversy.\n[15:45] [gasps]\n[15:46] >> You know, my opinion about like I don't\n[15:48] have a proper benchmark, but my\n[15:52] >> just go go on vibes.\n[15:54] >> Yes. On vibes,\n[15:56] I think Opus is amazing. I mean, I'm I'm\n[15:59] I'm 100% entropic right now. So, um like\n[16:04] I have the\n[16:05] >> I'm really considering like but I don't\n[16:07] have much else to cancel, but I want to\n[16:09] cancel everything and just go in like on\n[16:11] the max plan, you know, $100 on Tropic.\n[16:14] There you go.\n[16:14] >> Oh my goodness. [laughter]\n[16:15] >> Yeah, because I mean I think this month\n[16:18] I spent about 100 anyway. I spent\n[16:20] >> speaking speaking of spending money. So,\n[16:23] so basically I got an email from my\n[16:25] employer\n[16:27] uh and they said that I'm limited to\n[16:29] like a 50 a soft limit of $50 with\n[16:33] Anthropic, but for some reason the the\n[16:36] whole Anthropic UI is messed up. I can't\n[16:38] see how much my spend is\n[16:41] and looking at dashboard.\n[16:44] >> Um, let me just double check.\n[16:48] Last time I logged in, I I just couldn't\n[16:50] see it. It's all in under this company\n[16:54] account and I couldn't get any\n[16:56] visibility.\n[16:57] >> Okay.\n[16:58] >> No.\n[16:58] >> Yeah. It's a bit hard to know\n[17:00] >> what you can do if you if they tell give\n[17:02] you an abstract number and they and\n[17:03] there's no way for you to check.\n[17:05] >> Exactly.\n[17:07] But like for example, what I like I went\n[17:10] I tried um here's another thing I wanted\n[17:12] to share with you.\n[17:14] I went nuts with um this agents feature\n[17:17] because I just learned about it. I\n[17:18] didn't know about it. the picture that\n[17:19] you sent about the dependable thing.\n[17:21] >> Yeah. So,\n[17:22] >> it's interesting.\n[17:24] >> Yeah. So, I basically\n[17:26] set up an agent\n[17:28] >> to basically merge all the dependable\n[17:30] bot PRs on like 300 repos.\n[17:33] >> Smart idea. [laughter]\n[17:35] >> But\n[17:36] >> wait, you just pulled in shalloot\n[17:40] on every ripple. [laughter]\n[17:42] [snorts]\n[17:43] >> What?\n[17:44] You know the the worm that the\n[17:49] npm worm that\n[17:50] >> Oh, no. Hopefully not.\n[17:52] >> Hopefully not.\n[17:53] >> What's his name? Shad Halute.\n[17:56] >> Well, that's I don't know, right?\n[17:58] >> Okay. So, let me just run you through\n[18:01] this uh prompt. So, use the GitHub CLI,\n[18:04] which is the name of my agent, by the\n[18:06] way. I'll show you the agent in a bit.\n[18:08] to spawn agents in parallel to look at\n[18:10] the issues to each of my repos\n[18:15] and look to merge dependabot and then\n[18:18] I'm I just thought it was prude to do\n[18:20] something like you know touch repo name\n[18:21] once done\n[18:23] to ensure the repo isn't done again\n[18:26] then I went bananas going going through\n[18:30] I think it launched 50 agents in\n[18:32] parallel so this was like three or four\n[18:35] it was like doing three or four or five\n[18:38] tool calls each one for some reason.\n[18:40] >> Is this haiku or son?\n[18:42] >> Uh I was using haiku.\n[18:44] >> Yeah, it's really fast.\n[18:46] >> And so I when it was running, you can\n[18:49] just imagine this is like 3045. It also\n[18:52] showed the token here. Now that's gone\n[18:54] cuz I'm just I launched up to the resume\n[18:57] thing right now.\n[18:58] >> Don't you have it on your screenshot? I\n[19:00] think the screenshot you sent me has it.\n[19:01] >> Yeah, may maybe.\n[19:02] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[19:03] >> So it it went it did the job I think as\n[19:06] best as it it could. I mean, obviously\n[19:07] it runs into conflicts and some things\n[19:10] got messed up, but all in all, it's\n[19:12] quite a safe process.\n[19:14] About like, I don't know, 10 minutes\n[19:17] into the whole process, this thing kind\n[19:19] of blew me away. So, you can see that\n[19:21] it's processed 45\n[19:25] um maybe another 100 or something like\n[19:27] that.\n[19:29] And then like\n[19:32] sort of like uh halfway through the\n[19:33] process, it says, \"Let me create a\n[19:36] script\n[19:37] to process all remaining repositories\n[19:39] more efficiently.\"\n[19:41] >> That's good.\n[19:42] >> And I was like, \"Holy shit.\"\n[19:44] >> That's what a human would do. Right.\n[19:45] >> Exactly. I was like, \"Holy [ __ ] I\n[19:49] didn't even\n[19:51] tell it to do that, you know.\"\n[19:53] >> No, but that's exactly what you and I\n[19:55] would do, right? We would start to do it\n[19:56] manually. We would always get like\n[19:58] similar problems and kind of get a good\n[20:00] feel about like what works, what are the\n[20:02] problems we encounter and then we make a\n[20:04] script for it. And it's kind of like\n[20:05] what it did.\n[20:06] >> Yeah. I'm like I'm like you know my\n[20:11] I was getting kind of hairs on the back\n[20:13] of my head type of thing. Um and then\n[20:17] and then it b then it kick uh then it\n[20:20] kicks off the uh the shell script and\n[20:22] runs it in the background and then it\n[20:24] gives you and then it checks again\n[20:27] >> and then it does a bit of a summary\n[20:29] >> but okay what I wanted to show you this\n[20:32] is that I I just don't have a how many\n[20:34] it used a bunch of tokens but I don't\n[20:36] actually know how many is there some\n[20:38] clever what is the way of seeing the\n[20:40] context window it's just like context\n[20:41] isn't it\n[20:42] >> yeah but like the context window is not\n[20:44] going to tell you anything. It's usually\n[20:46] the slash usage thing, but that's so\n[20:48] limited now. It's just two bars. And\n[20:49] it's so funny they went from showing how\n[20:51] much you have used uh from how much you\n[20:54] have left back to how much you have\n[20:55] used. It's Did you have Did you not\n[20:58] watch that whole situation with the bar?\n[21:00] You I think you were asking me or I you\n[21:02] sent me.\n[21:03] >> Yeah. Like there's a lot of controversy\n[21:04] around that status line and everything\n[21:06] like that. I guess that they're I mean\n[21:09] it doesn't inspire confidence when they\n[21:10] do [ __ ] like that, do it, does it?\n[21:12] They're trying to hide. Funny thing is\n[21:13] what I saw on Reddit, somebody posted\n[21:15] like how come when I use cloud code on\n[21:18] my Mac um I get the the how much I have\n[21:21] left and when I use it on my um like my\n[21:25] Linux box my DBN um it shows me how much\n[21:28] I have used and some comment was like\n[21:30] isn't it funny that like the DBN package\n[21:32] administrator refused to integrate this\n[21:35] [laughter]\n[21:36] change and he didn't like it and now\n[21:38] they're back um like in the change log\n[21:41] they said like reverted the usage bar to\n[21:44] the original. But that's [snorts] one of\n[21:46] the comments that Tio said like um you\n[21:49] did a great job on Tropic. Um I'm open\n[21:51] to talk. Yeah. As if they need you. But\n[21:54] anyway, and then\n[21:56] >> yeah, talk to me. Um\n[21:58] >> I I want to move from open AI.\n[22:00] >> Yeah, he needs the red carpet. He's he\n[22:03] was also constantly showing how much he\n[22:04] spent like, oh, I've you know, spent one\n[22:06] hour like, oh, it's $150 now. It's a lot\n[22:08] of my pocket, but I'm happy to show you\n[22:10] guys the benchmark. I mean, credit\n[22:12] though. It's an impressive benchmark and\n[22:13] it the way that he's very quickly\n[22:16] spinning up all these models with the\n[22:17] same tasks and showing them.\n[22:19] >> So, how does he how does he know how\n[22:20] much he's spending and I have absolutely\n[22:22] no clue because because of the usage of\n[22:25] >> because you're in an org account it\n[22:27] looks like like on mine. So, a while ago\n[22:29] we were thinking how can we track our\n[22:31] usage properly and I was like yeah I\n[22:33] don't really have an idea. I just wait\n[22:34] until it's done and I look at my usage.\n[22:36] But now I found a decent way which is on\n[22:39] my account in my billing page I can see\n[22:42] exactly how much like pretty much live\n[22:45] um as it is running I can see little by\n[22:47] little my week my hourly budget filling\n[22:50] up and my weekly budget filling up and\n[22:53] then my extra usage like the wallets\n[22:55] that I I put in there also filling up\n[22:56] with open\n[22:57] >> maybe can you give me like a a rule of\n[23:00] thumb like for example this context\n[23:02] window here I mean it's half full.\n[23:07] >> There is a package called\n[23:08] >> is is is a is a half full context maybe\n[23:11] you know two bucks and a full context\n[23:13] about four you know four bucks. Can I is\n[23:17] there some rule of thumb I can use?\n[23:22] >> I think is really not the way to go for\n[23:25] this because um there's even new like\n[23:29] with Opus 4.5 they added new\n[23:32] capabilities into the cloud code shell\n[23:34] things like the ability to progressively\n[23:38] search and expose tools to the model. Um\n[23:41] the ability for the model to you know\n[23:43] this whole blog post that I did about\n[23:44] MCPS.\n[23:45] >> Yeah. Yeah, but this is expressed here,\n[23:47] right? This is expressed in the system\n[23:48] prompt, isn't it?\n[23:50] >> So basically this whole shell even has a\n[23:52] new functionality to automatically\n[23:54] compact the context. So you cannot go\n[23:57] off like this context status uh diagram\n[24:01] to determine how much you've currently\n[24:02] used because they are changing how all\n[24:05] of that work and this is not meant to\n[24:07] display your your your usage. There's a\n[24:10] there's a tab for usage. Well, let Oh, I\n[24:12] forgot to show you the um the actual\n[24:15] agent.\n[24:17] So, this is what a agent looks like.\n[24:18] It's it's in the docu agents directory.\n[24:21] And then it's kind of like a a skill,\n[24:26] but you're supposed to specify tools and\n[24:29] model. I I mean, maybe it's an optional\n[24:32] thing to be honest. So, here, as I\n[24:34] mentioned, I I specified Haiku. to be\n[24:37] honest, I grabbed this from um some guy\n[24:39] I've been email email conversing with,\n[24:44] guy named James.\n[24:46] But yeah, so this ba this agent\n[24:48] basically\n[24:50] equips Claude to use the GitHub CLI,\n[24:53] which is, you know, the GitHub CLI is\n[24:55] one of the best things about GitHub,\n[24:56] right? You can go nuts with it.\n[25:00] >> You also wrote a skill, right? You wrote\n[25:02] the GitHub action skill for work.\n[25:03] >> Yeah, I did. I did that. Yeah. So, um,\n[25:07] that's also something\n[25:10] I'm I'm a little bit confused between\n[25:11] agents and skills and all the rest of\n[25:14] it. I'm a little bit like and also my\n[25:15] Claude when I run Claude. Um, I I need\n[25:18] to uninstall beads because every time I\n[25:20] go slash command, it's like 99% bloody\n[25:23] beads commands.\n[25:24] >> Absolutely. This get rid of beats MCP.\n[25:27] It's a complete disaster because they\n[25:29] don't have Isn't that I think it's the\n[25:31] plugin that sets all this [ __ ] up.\n[25:33] >> Oh, yeah. I didn't do that. All right, I\n[25:35] just installed the BD CLI. I tried the\n[25:37] MCP and I already uninstalled the\n[25:40] >> manage. Okay. Okay, this is going. How\n[25:42] do you uninstall? Delete to uninstall.\n[25:45] Okay, it's gone. And hopefully Oh man,\n[25:48] still\n[25:48] >> so I've got a story about a about skills\n[25:51] cuz I I've [clears throat] used actually\n[25:54] cloud code the shell\n[25:57] uses has built-in agents right since a\n[26:00] few releases ago. So when you go into\n[26:02] plan mode often times when you prompt it\n[26:06] to start planning launches agents.\n[26:11] >> Oh my goodness.\n[26:12] >> Oh, you have costs. I haven't seen that.\n[26:14] There you go.\n[26:15] >> They have a aside from the usage now you\n[26:17] have an because I was every single CLI\n[26:20] actually has a really nice summary.\n[26:22] Gemini CLI.\n[26:23] >> But how come that how come that was so\n[26:25] Wait a minute.\n[26:28] How come this I guess it doesn't have\n[26:30] the my previous run does it?\n[26:33] >> Probably not. No, this is probably your\n[26:35] cost from this shell session. Even if\n[26:37] you restore a previous\n[26:39] >> See, this is why I don't want my\n[26:40] commands to be polluted. That's the\n[26:42] first time I just noticed this stuff.\n[26:44] >> Yeah, you beats and the the same second\n[26:47] you see the command that you needed.\n[26:49] >> Yeah. [laughter]\n[26:50] >> Okay, so plugins pros and cons. Um same\n[26:54] with MCPS, right? But but we were just\n[26:57] talking about agents and and I was about\n[26:59] to like share with you my experience.\n[27:01] You you also don't know what's the\n[27:02] difference between skills and agents.\n[27:05] >> So basically agents actually are part of\n[27:07] your shell. They come come with it no\n[27:09] matter if you build them or not.\n[27:13] >> Okay. So what's what agents are there\n[27:16] already then? Are you you suggesting\n[27:18] that\n[27:18] >> the planning agents the explore agents?\n[27:20] If you go into agents without building\n[27:22] any uh slash agents, you will see that\n[27:26] builtin there's two agents at least.\n[27:28] Yeah. And I think they're adding more.\n[27:30] >> No, no. Well,\n[27:32] >> oh, built in. Okay. Sorry. [ __ ] I\n[27:35] [snorts] just killed the share.\n[27:36] >> Let me let me share my whole screen.\n[27:38] Hopefully I don't share anything insane.\n[27:42] >> Um,\n[27:46] yeah. So in agents, I've got my GitHub\n[27:48] CLI agent there. And then then it's\n[27:51] built\n[27:52] >> in agents general purpose\n[27:56] status line setup.\n[27:57] >> I ran that one.\n[28:02] >> Oh, okay. Okay. And then it sets up the\n[28:04] status line. Okay. What is it? That\n[28:07] status line is kind of like by default\n[28:09] it agents copies your bash shell status\n[28:11] and then it shows your bash shell status\n[28:13] line at the bottom.\n[28:16] Uh I think you just\n[28:20] >> Oh, I supposed to\n[28:23] >> Yeah.\n[28:23] >> run.\n[28:26] >> I think after a while would have come\n[28:28] back and and tried to run it.\n[28:33] >> You're auto compact. I have set that\n[28:35] off.\n[28:37] [snorts]\n[28:38] >> Yeah, that's\n[28:40] >> okay. So that's what did I just run\n[28:42] there? you wanted to do status line but\n[28:44] let not do that. Um so basically some\n[28:46] agents are in there the explore agent\n[28:48] from uses haiku to quickly go through\n[28:50] all of the paths and make a summary of\n[28:52] what's inside your repository. Um that's\n[28:55] what sometimes I guess that's what it\n[28:56] uses when you do your initial in it. It\n[28:58] will use the explore agent to quickly\n[29:00] find the data so not to waste money on\n[29:03] Sunday or things like that, right? And\n[29:05] then it has the um planning agent which\n[29:10] when you ask it to go into plan mode, it\n[29:12] will maybe spawn an explorer and then it\n[29:15] will spawn a plan agent to build um look\n[29:19] it gives it the context and it says like\n[29:21] I have to do this thing. It's very\n[29:23] interesting because when you when you do\n[29:24] control O you see the actual prompt that\n[29:26] it sends to the SP planning agent. So\n[29:29] it's interesting to see I've been trying\n[29:31] to leverage agents and spend them spawn\n[29:33] them the way that you've done but like\n[29:35] what you've done with the GitHub CLI\n[29:37] agent is really nice. I mean that's a\n[29:39] really good good use and you I'm happy\n[29:42] for you worked out because when I tried\n[29:44] it it was a disaster. [gasps]\n[29:47] Um and then skills. So I have a very\n[29:50] very very funny experience. um with\n[29:54] skills.\n[29:55] >> Okay. I'm I'm I'm trying to describe\n[29:58] just to capture. Yeah, you're welcome to\n[30:02] add screenshots and other things to this\n[30:06] excal.\n[30:08] >> I'm sure if I can, but basically what\n[30:10] happened was this. I um I spent like\n[30:14] close to $15\n[30:16] pretty much my whole monthly budget on\n[30:18] Opus to generate a really extensive plan\n[30:22] um of a feature that I'm working on. And\n[30:24] then I was like, \"Okay, I I can't use\n[30:26] more than that, like because I'm I'm\n[30:28] over budget.\"\n[30:28] >> I I still don't understand how you can\n[30:30] spend $50 like that. Okay, carry on.\n[30:32] >> 15.\n[30:33] >> Oh, okay.\n[30:34] >> On API calls on Opus 4.5. And so I went\n[30:38] to to say to to anti-gravity and asked\n[30:41] it like okay here's a very extensive\n[30:43] plan and here's the prompt that speckit\n[30:46] provides. It's a very detailed prompt\n[30:48] like do this, do this, read the\n[30:50] research, read the plan and start\n[30:51] generating tasks. Right? So I told you\n[30:55] that I I switched all of the prompts to\n[30:58] use uh beads to to create uh tasks\n[31:00] instead of generating a long markdown\n[31:02] because then it gets lost when it needs\n[31:04] to do the work and it basically dies as\n[31:06] soon as it tries to read the number of\n[31:08] tasks it need to do and try to figure\n[31:09] out what it has to complete. So beats\n[31:11] does help me there. I do think it really\n[31:13] helps me to to create very focused\n[31:15] sessions. Um, so I asked Gemini to with\n[31:18] the prompt that works really well with\n[31:20] Sonet and it did an absolutely horrible\n[31:24] job. It created every single issue with\n[31:26] just a title and a oneline description.\n[31:29] Now the idea is that you can just read\n[31:31] that one task and you can just go off\n[31:34] and do what you need to do. So that task\n[31:35] needs to have information about which\n[31:37] file to change, what to change, why to\n[31:40] change it, acceptance criteria,\n[31:42] references to the plan and the research.\n[31:44] I mean surely you could change to happen\n[31:46] >> instructed it to keep to some sort of\n[31:48] template.\n[31:49] >> Yeah. So that's the prompt, right?\n[31:50] That's the prompt I gave it. I gave both\n[31:52] Son and Okay. So basically you told it\n[31:56] to do it, but it it ended up just doing\n[31:57] one line\n[31:58] >> and it did one line and I was like, how\n[32:01] is it possible? How come Son 4.5 is so\n[32:03] much better than Gemini 3, which is\n[32:06] supposed to be like the premier model\n[32:08] right now from Google? And of course,\n[32:11] we're talking about skills, you can\n[32:12] guess, I have a beat skill that I\n[32:14] completely forgot about. So even though\n[32:17] my prompt was identical and it only\n[32:19] showed like use beats, create a task\n[32:21] like this.\n[32:22] >> Oh, so that you're saying that the beads\n[32:24] the beads prompt messed up the the\n[32:27] process or something or what? What I'm\n[32:28] saying is that son has an agent skill\n[32:31] capability where it like progressively\n[32:33] learns how to use beats and my prompt\n[32:36] was identical but behind the scenes\n[32:39] within the shell environment or however\n[32:41] the cloud code is built because it's\n[32:42] closed source somehow son creates very\n[32:46] detailed issues and maybe I can share my\n[32:49] screen actually.\n[32:50] >> Yeah, sure. I'm curious.\n[32:53] >> Okay, so basically Claude came up\n[33:00] Claude won because of of beads and\n[33:02] knowing the stuff. Okay. But that still\n[33:06] doesn't explain why Gemini did these\n[33:07] oneline things, but anyway.\n[33:10] >> Okay, I can I can explain it. I actually\n[33:12] sent you a detailed video about\n[33:14] >> Oh, yeah. Actually, I haven't read your\n[33:16] chat very closely. Let me just read it\n[33:17] now.\n[33:18] >> Uh,\n[33:20] phone a farmer.\n[33:23] That's uh apparently a Belgian dude that\n[33:26] works for Austra that um is one of the\n[33:28] like original Gatsby developers and he's\n[33:31] one of the early\n[33:33] he's Belgian and he he he's like the\n[33:36] first far farmer founder\n[33:40] members of of Mastra and Master is a\n[33:43] really interesting um TypeScript only\n[33:46] framework to build agent workflows. So,\n[33:48] it's a really cool uh framework that I\n[33:50] that I did a conference talk about uh\n[33:53] back in March. So, you can\n[33:54] >> Oh, by the way, are you going to be in\n[33:55] Belgium soon because there's a there's a\n[33:58] good conference at the end of the year\n[33:59] or the new year.\n[34:00] >> I I I was telling so so I went to\n[34:03] Singapore three times and I went to\n[34:04] Koala Lumpur and I was telling my wife,\n[34:07] let me up for conferences and I was\n[34:09] telling I'm going to Belgium in in\n[34:10] January or um and then she was look the\n[34:13] look she gave me I I knew there was no\n[34:16] way. [laughter]\n[34:17] >> [ __ ] Okay. When was the last time you\n[34:20] were in Belgium then?\n[34:22] >> Almost. I don't know. Um I can here.\n[34:26] This is Beats. [laughter]\n[34:27] >> Okay. Let's\n[34:28] >> distracting me. Okay. So So this\n[34:31] >> Yeah. So this is a a cheap Beats UI.\n[34:33] It's pretty cool actually.\n[34:34] >> Was this your UI cuz you one?\n[34:38] >> I started coding.\n[34:40] >> Um this one. So there's a discussion on\n[34:42] Beats where they talked about different\n[34:44] UIs. It's out of scope for the project\n[34:46] because they don't want to pollute it.\n[34:48] It's a beats is meant to be a CLI text\n[34:51] focused tool for agents to use. UI is\n[34:53] out of scope and it's hard to maintain\n[34:55] and puts with maintenance. So they\n[34:57] completely separate the beats UIs.\n[34:59] Therefore, there's quite a few of them.\n[35:00] >> This one is actually quite actively\n[35:03] maintained. I've\n[35:04] >> Yeah. Anyway, um so it keeps track of\n[35:07] all of the issues. It works directly\n[35:09] with the beat socket, so it's pretty\n[35:10] fast. Um the way I've instructed it to\n[35:14] use beats in my task generation is to\n[35:17] create epics for my big features and\n[35:20] then to create sub like features for the\n[35:22] user stories. So I get these nice flows\n[35:23] of like these are my two features I need\n[35:25] that I that I was working on and and\n[35:28] here I have like the different phases.\n[35:29] So this is what opus generated.\n[35:32] >> No, this is what Gemini generated. I\n[35:35] mean, if we're going to compare that to\n[35:37] this, which is way more in line with the\n[35:39] actual prompt, which is like user story\n[35:40] one, user story 2, and and when you look\n[35:43] at them, you have the graph and\n[35:45] dependencies.\n[35:46] >> Oh, man. This makes me this is so much\n[35:49] faster than Jira. I could cry.\n[35:52] >> Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]\n[35:53] >> I mean, Jira is so bad.\n[35:56] >> Yes. So, so this is one of the use the\n[35:59] the story that um the the user story\n[36:02] captured by Gemini, right? oneline\n[36:05] description automatically generate and\n[36:07] then in the dependencies are all the\n[36:09] tasks that belong to this user story. So\n[36:11] one of these like for example this one\n[36:13] was generated by Gemini which uh in the\n[36:15] overview we can see it's just like oh\n[36:17] add this um Golang packet library to to\n[36:21] automatically infer this the JSON schema\n[36:23] from JSON data sample\n[36:26] >> uh add this into a new infer service\n[36:29] into internal. It doesn't even say like\n[36:30] it's part of the grid API because this\n[36:32] repository has many different things.\n[36:33] So, so this is absolutely disgusting. If\n[36:35] I want to give this to Haiku, it's going\n[36:37] to completely it's going to go bonkers\n[36:39] and and completely mess up my code,\n[36:41] right? Um,\n[36:43] >> so this is one of created and then this\n[36:46] I show you the other one now created by\n[36:48] um\n[36:51] by like this one for example is created\n[36:54] by Son. Oh no, this one is\n[36:58] >> you need you need to you need to add a\n[36:59] label that is created by um\n[37:04] No.\n[37:04] >> Gemini or so many or um where is it?\n[37:08] >> Yeah. Can you can you alter your\n[37:10] integration skill?\n[37:14] >> Make sure you label which which model\n[37:16] put this thing in.\n[37:19] >> That's actually not a bad idea because\n[37:20] there's the author part here and I can\n[37:22] see sometimes cloud puts itself as the\n[37:24] assigne and that actually keeps it like\n[37:26] nice to see. Um but integrate inference\n[37:29] into state upload update proto\n[37:31] definitions update goal schema is that\n[37:35] okay this is so in the video I sent you\n[37:37] I cut out all of the me searching which\n[37:39] one was created by which model uh and\n[37:41] it's really neat like the difference but\n[37:43] here you can see the difference right\n[37:44] this is how I want an issue to look like\n[37:47] which is update the go SDK schema uh\n[37:50] source field um so that it lives here\n[37:53] right um this is the description then\n[37:55] this is another flag that beat says to\n[37:57] design right this is the changes you\n[37:59] need to make there's some notes um which\n[38:01] hasn't had any notes and then there's\n[38:03] the acceptance criteria output key um is\n[38:06] like this this is the the final result\n[38:08] and this is kind of like what I want\n[38:09] like the big planner model opus\n[38:11] generates this type of design and then I\n[38:13] want to give it to like a very fast and\n[38:15] dumb model and if they are not if they\n[38:18] are not going outside and too creative\n[38:20] then hiku normally would end up with\n[38:22] exactly to the spec and then I would be\n[38:24] able to like everything would perfectly\n[38:26] Cool. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\n[38:28] That's a really good optimization. So,\n[38:30] just to replay my understanding, you you\n[38:33] get Opus to plan everything, put\n[38:36] everything in beads as as task and then\n[38:39] you then you spin out haiku agents to\n[38:42] implement it.\n[38:43] >> Yeah. So, beads beats allows models to\n[38:46] focus on the tasks and then you can kill\n[38:48] a session and you can just spin up a new\n[38:50] one, tell it to read this is your work.\n[38:51] You need this is your scope right here\n[38:53] and then it goes off and does that\n[38:55] thing, right? Right. And it keeps\n[38:56] >> cool. So, how do you\n[38:58] >> So, how come Gemini was so horrible at\n[39:00] it, right?\n[39:01] >> Yeah.\n[39:02] >> Um, so in anti-gravity, this was\n[39:04] actually the output from Gemini. Um,\n[39:06] >> it's just anti-gravity right here.\n[39:08] >> Yeah, this is anti-gravity.\n[39:09] >> So, it's just exactly like VS Code, I\n[39:11] guess.\n[39:12] >> Yeah, they're all VS Code clones. They\n[39:14] >> um\n[39:14] >> I your animal I can't believe you have\n[39:16] mini map.\n[39:18] >> That That's how I judge people.\n[39:20] >> Mini Map is great. I use it all the time\n[39:22] to scroll. Whenever I see an error, I\n[39:24] just click on it and then I'm right\n[39:25] there. I see it. It's really nice the\n[39:27] color coding of it. Yeah, I really like\n[39:28] it.\n[39:29] >> Okay. Um I don't like mini.\n[39:31] >> So this is the speckit. This is the\n[39:33] specket task um that you you need to\n[39:35] give in anti-gravity. Again, you see how\n[39:38] many stupid folders I have. I have\n[39:39] Gemini, I have codeex, I have cloud, and\n[39:42] now I have to add another one for\n[39:43] agent/workflows because that's what\n[39:45] anti-gravity uses. And they're all the\n[39:47] same. They're all exactly the same. Now\n[39:49] the problem is here when I say like this\n[39:51] is how you use CLI calls. This is how\n[39:53] you create a feature an epic right? This\n[39:56] is how you create a user story. Um and\n[39:59] you add the specs like this and this is\n[40:00] the face.\n[40:01] >> Okay. So you're templating a little bit.\n[40:03] >> Yeah. But as you can see the only thing\n[40:05] I say is you give it a title, you give\n[40:07] it a description and nothing else. And I\n[40:09] was like huh. So maybe this is my\n[40:12] problem. How did I have a difference\n[40:14] with what I give son? And I go to son\n[40:16] and it's exactly the same. You just give\n[40:18] it a description and there's no\n[40:20] information about giving it design notes\n[40:22] or acceptance criteria, right? So,\n[40:24] >> okay. So, it must have pulled out some\n[40:27] context from your from your user profile\n[40:30] or something.\n[40:31] >> Yeah. So, so you put\n[40:34] you put this uh under my home directory.\n[40:37] I don't know if you can see it in the\n[40:38] terminal.\n[40:38] >> Yeah. Yeah. Claude. Yeah. I'm I'm always\n[40:41] on on I'd like to keep everything on a\n[40:43] project level. I hate to put things in\n[40:45] my home directory. I absolutely agree\n[40:47] with you because I want to check this\n[40:48] into to git so if anyone pulls it down\n[40:50] they can get the exact same experience\n[40:52] right uh but anyway this is how\n[40:54] apparently when I installed this is how\n[40:56] skills worked I don't know if right now\n[40:58] you can do it at the project level for\n[40:59] skills but issue creation is here\n[41:03] >> nice\n[41:04] >> and issue creation is very detailed\n[41:08] >> design fields acceptance criteria\n[41:10] >> yeah this is so good\n[41:11] >> oh my god I did I completely forgot\n[41:14] about it right and and and So I I didn't\n[41:16] even know like that.\n[41:17] >> So mystery solved, right? So be so\n[41:19] Gemini is not that bad.\n[41:22] >> You can't be blamed.\n[41:24] >> So at that point I think Gemini my first\n[41:27] intuition was like Gemini is really good\n[41:28] at following the instructions because\n[41:30] another thing that's different between\n[41:31] the two is that here they are perfectly\n[41:35] like this. Use a story colon and then\n[41:37] the name. But I also just noticed now\n[41:39] when we're talking about it here it's\n[41:41] like phase 2 phase B to B. Why is it so\n[41:44] different?\n[41:45] um why are they not like following the\n[41:47] same? Because if I look at at um any\n[41:49] other issues in the um epics in the\n[41:51] back. So this is some problem with this\n[41:53] this uh this this UI. I can't go back to\n[41:55] the old epics to show you how they\n[41:57] looked. Once they're closed, they're not\n[41:58] here anymore. Um also I can't show you\n[42:00] the comments. Um so on a lot of these I\n[42:03] solved it by letting Sony add comments\n[42:06] with missing design documents. Uh but\n[42:08] yeah, so now I just noticed as well that\n[42:11] I actually give it the sample is like\n[42:13] this, right? It's like face setup.\n[42:15] Actually, it is like this story US1.\n[42:17] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[42:18] >> So, it does put the story on it, but\n[42:20] Yeah.\n[42:21] >> Well, this is cool. I [snorts]\n[42:24] >> Oh, man. I I just love that that I need\n[42:28] to sync my work Jira into Beads or\n[42:31] something. I did see someone developed a\n[42:33] plugin or something. So,\n[42:36] >> I'm I'm like I think 10 versions behind\n[42:38] Beats by now, right? Because this thing\n[42:39] moves so fast. Um, and then when I look\n[42:42] at the change logs, it's like um new\n[42:45] feature, then two two commits later or\n[42:47] new release with fix and revert. And\n[42:48] then I see commits like um\n[42:52] fix uh like corrupt data issue. And I\n[42:55] was like, okay, I don't want to update\n[42:56] [laughter] cuz it's like it works.\n[42:59] It's moving too fast. I don't want to\n[43:01] like spend a day to move to a new\n[43:03] version. And then also I have to make\n[43:05] sure my skills updated. I have to make\n[43:07] sure my templates are updated with the\n[43:08] right. It's such a cool time right now.\n[43:11] So like I wanted to maybe just touch on\n[43:15] um\n[43:17] on I mean we we are early adopters.\n[43:22] Is the rest of I was just curious to ask\n[43:24] if the rest of your company or your your\n[43:27] team is is using the same stuff as you\n[43:30] or or it's not not not yet really.\n[43:34] >> So this is where we talk. So last time\n[43:36] you one thing you mentioned to me was\n[43:38] Steve Jagger's talk at the summit where\n[43:40] he mentioned about people that do not\n[43:42] adopt AI significantly have a\n[43:44] disadvantage and there's a big problem\n[43:46] in open AI where um they don't know how\n[43:49] to do the reviews because they cannot\n[43:51] compare somebody that does use AI\n[43:53] against somebody who does not use AI and\n[43:55] you hate and I watch\n[43:56] >> I don't know if you noticed that that\n[43:58] Claude also published this like paper on\n[44:01] productivity gains\n[44:02] >> you shared it with me as well. Yeah,\n[44:04] >> it was I think it was quite a big number\n[44:07] like speeds up individual tasks by 80%.\n[44:10] I mean that's\n[44:12] >> the thing is one of the first lines in\n[44:14] the in this paper is like we asked Sonet\n[44:17] to analyze and Sony came up with these\n[44:19] hypothetical [laughter] goals and I'm\n[44:20] like\n[44:21] >> we as we asked Sonet to analyze the\n[44:23] productivity gains of Sonet.\n[44:26] >> Yeah. I mean like one of the things I\n[44:28] always get from son is like it's going\n[44:29] to take 3 4 days to build this thing or\n[44:32] one of like two weeks and so on. Um\n[44:36] >> well you asked it to estimate.\n[44:37] >> No I don't ask it every single time you\n[44:40] ask it to plan. May maybe it's in my\n[44:41] spec kit prompts again right I'm using\n[44:44] these tools I don't know\n[44:45] >> okay your context is polluted then more\n[44:48] than mine at least.\n[44:51] >> Well it's it's been effective. Um but\n[44:54] but it's kind of funny because another\n[44:57] thing that happens since we spoke is\n[45:01] the research preview of cloud code web\n[45:04] ran out and on on Sunday, right? So I\n[45:08] had like we spoke maybe on Tuesday and I\n[45:10] had like a week to and I only I was\n[45:14] literally rushing. So in to maximize the\n[45:16] use. So usually I use specit right I I\n[45:19] build out these big plans. So, I went to\n[45:21] the cloud code web research preview and\n[45:24] on the mobile app while I'm at, you\n[45:26] know, um a restaurant to watch the F1 uh\n[45:30] Las Vegas. I was on my phone uh specking\n[45:34] out a feature for my project in cloud\n[45:37] code uh web uh or actually on the on the\n[45:40] mobile app and and and and there's no\n[45:43] specit there's no beats in that\n[45:45] environment, right? It's a very sandbox.\n[45:47] So how how the hell were you doing that?\n[45:51] it kind of what I wanted to to say was\n[45:53] like without specit without all of this\n[45:55] like what you just said context polluted\n[45:57] things just give the tool in its like\n[46:00] natural environment and I think that\n[46:02] they were triing opus in this\n[46:04] environment too to be honest um they\n[46:07] they tell everyone here's $250 give it\n[46:10] some task we control the environment and\n[46:12] we'll see how son and you know how they\n[46:14] do trials right so so it gave me really\n[46:16] good results um so Then\n[46:20] I wanted to adopt this one because this\n[46:23] one is quite significant right I want to\n[46:25] basically what I'm working on is on the\n[46:27] terraform state management whenever you\n[46:29] do terapform apply and you have some\n[46:31] outputs I want to capture a schema\n[46:33] around those outputs so it will it will\n[46:36] store a JSON schema so if you're\n[46:38] building some other infrastructure\n[46:39] somewhere else you can pull down that\n[46:41] JSON schema from the other state and you\n[46:43] can code against that because that's\n[46:45] what you can expect that the outputs\n[46:47] will look like and and it will also\n[46:49] change right if if the if the output\n[46:51] schema changes it will it will flag it\n[46:53] it will say like yeah the values change\n[46:55] you need to replan but not only that the\n[46:57] schema changed so you may may have like\n[46:59] complete breakage when you consume these\n[47:01] outputs right so so it's a quite a big\n[47:03] features with a lot of um capabilities\n[47:06] in there so the initial thing that I\n[47:08] asked while I was in in uh watching F1 I\n[47:11] asked chat GPT like I've got this API um\n[47:14] I want to do like I want people to be\n[47:17] able to register the shape of those\n[47:19] outputs. Um, my primary library is in\n[47:21] Typescript and they have these\n[47:22] definition files and TypeScript is a\n[47:24] great language to defining schemas. Um,\n[47:26] however, not everyone is using\n[47:28] TypeScript. Um, and it would be annoying\n[47:30] that you have to define a TypeScript\n[47:31] interface. Um, although I like the the\n[47:34] way of writing TypeScript is way more\n[47:36] nicer than than defining JSON schema in\n[47:39] my opinion. Uh, but I thought maybe to\n[47:41] keep it simple, TypeScript can easily go\n[47:43] to JSON schema. uh maybe there's some\n[47:45] fidelity loss and not exactly the same\n[47:47] but you can go between them. So I\n[47:49] thought like JSON schema seems like the\n[47:51] best option to go across languages cuz\n[47:53] then you can have JSON schema supporting\n[47:55] everything Python um and everything. So\n[47:58] a little bit a little back and forth\n[48:00] between me and open eye which is really\n[48:03] more like a rubber duck at that point\n[48:04] right he just says yeah sure go with\n[48:06] Jason\n[48:07] >> great you are great [laughter]\n[48:09] >> absolutely also shadow conspiracy\n[48:14] anyway um so so so that was the first\n[48:17] step right uh identifying how uh like\n[48:19] what how do we capture the schema um and\n[48:22] this this whole inference thing wasn't a\n[48:24] thing I was just like I want to give\n[48:25] people the ability to just post like an\n[48:27] endpoint to post what the output shape\n[48:30] will be like and and then we can look at\n[48:32] like validating it right so but there's\n[48:34] I was thinking to myself this is so\n[48:36] complicated for 100% there's 100 like\n[48:39] edge cases and scenarios that I'm not\n[48:40] taking into account but I think that's\n[48:42] what's great about Sonet um and this is\n[48:45] one of the things that I shared in a\n[48:46] video with you as well is that I ask son\n[48:50] to do these things in a web console you\n[48:52] know using my phone with a very basic\n[48:53] description um and it gives me prompting\n[48:57] which kind of works. Um but then what\n[49:00] happened is when I got home I was like\n[49:02] it only implemented half of it. For\n[49:04] example, it didn't do the schema\n[49:06] validation part. It it it give the\n[49:08] endpoint for people to post the schema\n[49:10] but it didn't give an like ability to\n[49:12] when you do Terraform apply it doesn't\n[49:15] track if the schema validation is is is\n[49:18] still valid for those outputs. So I was\n[49:20] like oh that's missing. Um and so I\n[49:23] decided that I wanted to adopt this\n[49:25] branch created by cloud code with\n[49:27] specit. So I I I wrote a special prompt\n[49:30] like and modify all the scripts which is\n[49:32] like this this branch was created\n[49:34] outside of specit\n[49:36] look at all of the existing work that\n[49:38] has been done and then create a a\n[49:41] feature like description and then also I\n[49:44] asked Opus to review it from like an\n[49:46] infrastructure um you know consultant\n[49:48] engineer uh what are the day two\n[49:50] operations that you know may be issues.\n[49:53] For example, we we designed the feature\n[49:55] to track the JSON schema per state per\n[49:57] output. But I'm like, \"Yeah, but the\n[49:59] network goes from defaf to prod. So the\n[50:02] schema should be the same. So why do I\n[50:04] attach the schema to the state output?\"\n[50:06] And um and he's like, \"Yeah, absolutely.\n[50:10] But I [laughter]\n[50:12] I'm always like the devil's advocate.\n[50:15] I'm going to tell it we should make it\n[50:17] global.\" And he was like,\n[50:18] >> \"Yeah.\" Okay. So just just to summarize\n[50:20] what you were saying to me is that\n[50:22] >> is that\n[50:24] >> you were you watching F1 you're on\n[50:27] claude code mobile you you you developed\n[50:30] some ideas opus or son shows that it's\n[50:34] much better\n[50:35] >> and then you were able to adopt it in\n[50:37] your your spec kit flow that your b your\n[50:40] mobile session effectively right\n[50:43] >> yeah yeah yeah um I was able to clone\n[50:46] the branch adopt it with the speech\n[50:49] workflow that goes in through detailed\n[50:52] user story and edge case analysis and\n[50:54] then identifies what was done and wasn't\n[50:57] isn't done high priority to\n[50:59] >> I mean I'm trying I'm trying to find\n[51:00] reasons not to use my mobile but yeah\n[51:02] okay awesome awesome\n[51:04] >> yeah um but yeah\n[51:07] >> I wanted to quickly ask since you you're\n[51:09] showing the beads UI here\n[51:13] like\n[51:15] one thing\n[51:18] one thing I don't have good visibility\n[51:20] of which is which is of course why\n[51:23] project managers love to look at Jira or\n[51:26] um Pivotal or whatever the those things\n[51:29] are called. How quickly are you munching\n[51:32] through these tasks? Do you have a\n[51:34] velocity or something like that? Like\n[51:35] how do you measure?\n[51:37] >> I really like beats in the way that it\n[51:40] tries to capture it tries to be a local\n[51:42] Jira. It gives you stats. It gives you\n[51:44] rundown. And it gives you a chart.\n[51:46] There's a whole bunch. Yeah, there is BT\n[51:47] stats. Yes, it it tells you how long is\n[51:49] initial.\n[51:50] >> Can Can you show me some stats?\n[51:52] >> Yeah, but like like I said, I've used\n[51:54] Cloud Code web for a while, so Oh, it's\n[51:58] not going to be here. Hold on.\n[51:59] >> Oh, yeah. I think I'd noticed the BD\n[52:01] stats command, but I'm\n[52:02] >> There is a BD stat using it in anger\n[52:04] yet. [snorts]\n[52:06] >> Oh, I I need to get my prompt to do a\n[52:08] carriage return like yours.\n[52:12] >> Yeah, there's the average lead time.\n[52:13] What does what does that mean? That\n[52:15] means it takes uh 60 hours for something\n[52:19] to get done or what does that mean?\n[52:22] >> Yeah. Um don't ask me because I don't\n[52:25] use these. But your question was are\n[52:27] there stats and there are um there are\n[52:29] related to to hours and time because it\n[52:31] keeps track of when an issue was created\n[52:32] and when an issue was closed um and\n[52:34] things like that. Um it has quite a lot\n[52:37] of things like what you would expect.\n[52:39] This is why when I was talking to you\n[52:41] about building a UI for this is like I\n[52:42] kind of was inspired by Trello, right?\n[52:44] Because you have these little cards, you\n[52:46] have the labels, you have the comments,\n[52:47] you have\n[52:48] >> what?\n[52:50] >> Travel.\n[52:51] >> Inspired by\n[52:52] >> Trello. Trello. You mean Trello, right?\n[52:54] >> Trello that was acquired.\n[52:56] >> Yeah. Like a camb board or whatever.\n[52:57] Yeah.\n[52:58] >> Yeah. Which was acquired by Atlassian\n[53:00] unfortunately.\n[53:01] >> Oh yeah.\n[53:04] >> But that that's super cool. Um, I\n[53:08] basically at the back of my mind during\n[53:10] our conversation, I'm I'm I'm just\n[53:12] thinking about the the human aspect\n[53:13] because I feel supercharged by AI. Um,\n[53:18] but I'm just thinking like, you know, in\n[53:21] in a corporate environment,\n[53:25] how does this work with team members?\n[53:27] How do you\n[53:28] >> Yeah.\n[53:29] >> rationalize the productivity? How do you\n[53:31] train people? All these things are just\n[53:33] floating in my mind right now. That's\n[53:35] what you were asking earlier and I\n[53:36] diverted to the talk from Steve Yagi\n[53:38] about um about how\n[53:40] >> Oh yeah, like senior staff engineers. I\n[53:43] love that.\n[53:43] >> And what happened was the craftsman were\n[53:45] doing the same thing our staff engineers\n[53:46] are doing today.\n[53:48] >> No,\n[53:51] that's word for word, right? That's what\n[53:52] they say.\n[53:54] >> I love that.\n[53:55] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then he say word\n[53:57] for word.\n[53:58] >> Word for word, by the way. And the whole\n[54:00] room left. But then uh Jean Kim also\n[54:03] talked about you know the Dora reports\n[54:06] and and the work they do there where\n[54:07] they um identified and significant I\n[54:12] think the Dora report did say that there\n[54:14] wasn't like a performance improvement\n[54:16] but one of the things that he\n[54:18] highlighted and I think was very\n[54:19] relevant to the talk that we had last\n[54:21] time which is that AI usage is a skill\n[54:27] that you become more confident in the\n[54:29] more you use it. Yeah,\n[54:30] >> right.\n[54:31] >> When you never used it, you're going to\n[54:32] use an LLM. You're not really familiar\n[54:34] with how to prompt it. It's going to\n[54:35] give you something that looks good, but\n[54:36] when you poke through it, it's actually\n[54:38] garbage and you're immedately going to\n[54:39] use the trust,\n[54:40] >> but you don't know how to validate it.\n[54:42] >> It definitely rewards people who spend\n[54:44] time using it. Like I I was going to say\n[54:47] that like what you were doing by trying\n[54:50] different models,\n[54:52] >> by using work trees to try the things\n[54:54] that that Theo is doing, like the more\n[54:58] you do that, the more you you almost\n[55:00] resurrect an old project and just try\n[55:03] again.\n[55:05] >> I really think it's\n[55:07] >> the more you're going to learn, right?\n[55:08] The more investment in time. It's it's\n[55:11] really changing the workflow of a\n[55:13] software engineer.\n[55:15] >> Um\n[55:16] crazy\n[55:17] >> way more towards review part which I\n[55:19] always thought was a great part of it\n[55:20] though. Um I had this\n[55:22] >> well you say review but I'm I think more\n[55:24] like it's more of like an orchestration\n[55:26] thing. I feel like it's a pipeline like\n[55:28] you got to go back or you\n[55:31] >> it's both of them\n[55:33] >> both you need to know how to prompt and\n[55:35] feed the information and keep the\n[55:36] context st so that it can be focused and\n[55:38] delivers a task. Although that the tools\n[55:40] will more and more be better at that\n[55:42] because right now Opus is doing a lot of\n[55:43] things like automatically compacting\n[55:45] tool finding the tools relevant and\n[55:48] executing them correctly which is less\n[55:50] and less on you and more on the tool\n[55:52] right but on the other side so you need\n[55:53] to orchestrate it but you need to be\n[55:54] able to capture the requirements\n[55:56] fine-tune them and um you know review\n[55:59] basically review what the model is\n[56:00] telling you are the usea user stories\n[56:02] reviewing what the edge cases are\n[56:04] scoping it down making sure that is like\n[56:06] that's acceptable for what I'm trying to\n[56:08] deliver um you know talking to your um\n[56:12] stakeholders to make sure that we are\n[56:14] okay with like it working this way and\n[56:16] not doing that part cuz that's going to\n[56:17] be and that's one thing I really liked\n[56:19] about Opus cuz after I had it like\n[56:21] generate all of the things I I give it a\n[56:23] I should have saved the prompt which is\n[56:25] like okay look look for sentences that\n[56:29] look simple on paper but have a huge\n[56:31] implication in terms of complexity that\n[56:33] they add and I give an example which is\n[56:36] like one of the sentences that the model\n[56:38] loves to loves to put in these\n[56:40] requirements is like make sure that the\n[56:42] user that the error messages are very\n[56:44] detailed about what's going wrong and\n[56:46] that the user knows like how to react\n[56:48] and and work on the error message,\n[56:49] right? It sounds great. Yeah, actually\n[56:52] sounds great. And then you get to the\n[56:53] implementation part or you do a review\n[56:56] and then I use another model to do the\n[56:58] review and it keeps tripping up on this.\n[57:00] It's like this is not clear like what\n[57:02] does it mean? What is what is an\n[57:03] actionable error message? and and it\n[57:05] goes crazy and then you have to like and\n[57:07] and and I basically asked it and in this\n[57:09] case, right, this is this is kind of MVP\n[57:11] and I'm okay with the with the error\n[57:13] message just being a log in the server\n[57:15] and and just being like a red bar basic\n[57:17] uh feedback that's didn't work. Um and\n[57:20] and then Opus went through all of the\n[57:22] specs and immediately highlighted like\n[57:24] five six cases where this is kind of\n[57:26] like overkill for an MVP. this is kind\n[57:28] of like this might be really have big\n[57:30] implications uh in terms of like yeah I\n[57:33] I love that one um you know because\n[57:35] that's my biggest problem like scoping\n[57:37] down these models um so that's the first\n[57:40] part right being able to to to control\n[57:43] the context keep the\n[57:44] >> I still don't actually understand how\n[57:45] you can bugger off for for five you know\n[57:49] like weeks ago I think you maybe\n[57:51] exaggerating like you just get some some\n[57:55] your your tasks together and then you go\n[57:57] to the gym for 5 hours and then you come\n[57:58] back and the work is done like I mean\n[58:00] that doesn't how that doesn't sound\n[58:02] exaggerating uh that was about one\n[58:04] feature which is adding labels to\n[58:06] terraform state and then giving a query\n[58:09] engine to be able to query the labels\n[58:11] right and I spent two days on going\n[58:13] through the specs and the user stories\n[58:15] and selecting the Golang library that\n[58:17] allowed you to build expressions for\n[58:18] those labels and and it's kind of a\n[58:20] small scope compare that to building a\n[58:23] whole authentication system with OIDC\n[58:25] and and and keep\n[58:27] Right. So, so I kind of didn't realize\n[58:29] how how very scoped and narrow that\n[58:32] particular story that I gave you was\n[58:34] because I I felt like\n[58:35] >> I guess\n[58:36] >> I I I got a I get a I got a little bit\n[58:38] obsessed. Well, I I was captivated by by\n[58:42] this whole idea that you can walk away\n[58:44] from the computer and it's doing work\n[58:46] for you while you're asleep or\n[58:48] something. But I think in practice that\n[58:50] doesn't is not really the case because\n[58:52] you know models and agents are getting\n[58:53] faster and faster. It's it's all the\n[58:56] block. It's not it's there's no real\n[58:59] optimization there. The optimization is\n[59:02] purely in your prompting, your workflow,\n[59:04] your review.\n[59:06] >> Yeah. So, so I I I do always tend to\n[59:09] walk away when I see that the model has\n[59:12] kind of kicked off in a loop and is kind\n[59:14] of working on things and I don't want to\n[59:17] sit here and just watch it at that point\n[59:19] when I'm kind of sure that it's it's\n[59:21] okay. So, I I walk away from my machine\n[59:23] a lot more and I decide that I'm going\n[59:25] to go to the gym and I'm gone for an\n[59:27] hour and I come back. I don't know how\n[59:28] long it ran, right? But it pretty much\n[59:30] got to a state where it was like, \"Oh,\n[59:31] I'm approaching context limits. Let me\n[59:33] summarize and and see what I've done.\"\n[59:35] Um, and things like that. So,\n[59:37] >> I mean, you must go also yolo because\n[59:40] when I when I was running that agent\n[59:41] thing, it kept on asking me for prompts,\n[59:45] you know, all throughout the session.\n[59:47] Annoyingly,\n[59:49] >> it permission. uh\n[59:51] >> modals, right?\n[59:52] >> So funny, I never had it delete my home\n[59:54] user directory. I've never had it like\n[59:57] get hard reset anything. I don't give it\n[59:59] access to any databases. Um so I've\n[1:00:02] haven't had those issues.\n[1:00:05] >> But I've noticed that the CLI prompts\n[1:00:07] now like when I go into codeex and you\n[1:00:09] go to approvals and you go to like give\n[1:00:12] it full access in codeex before it was\n[1:00:14] like oh okay you give me full access\n[1:00:15] great. Now it goes like are you sure it\n[1:00:17] may completely destroy your machine? Are\n[1:00:19] you sure you want to do this? I'm like,\n[1:00:21] whoa, whoa, you're scaring me now.\n[1:00:22] Before it was just okay, but I guess\n[1:00:24] >> go going back to Jean Kim, I just\n[1:00:26] noticed I have a book by by Jean Kim\n[1:00:29] right next to me. This the Accelerate\n[1:00:31] book. Accelerate.\n[1:00:32] >> I don't know if you read that one. I\n[1:00:34] mean, Jean Kim is a a legend. So, so\n[1:00:37] just just to repeat what you said that\n[1:00:39] Jean Kim said, to be honest, I didn't\n[1:00:41] watch Jean Kim's presentation. So he's\n[1:00:43] saying that the more time\n[1:00:46] >> people like us spend spend with working\n[1:00:49] out working on these things, the more\n[1:00:50] >> the more they trust it.\n[1:00:52] >> Yeah. Well, it's not so much trust. It's\n[1:00:55] more it's the more\n[1:00:56] >> he says trust\n[1:00:57] >> comp competent we get too I suppose\n[1:01:01] >> I guess but it's more also about like\n[1:01:03] letting like trusting what it's doing.\n[1:01:06] It's okay knowing where to look for what\n[1:01:08] you know are like the areas where it\n[1:01:10] will mess up.\n[1:01:11] >> Yeah. I guess trust trust is a bit is a\n[1:01:13] bit wishy-washy, isn't it? It's not it's\n[1:01:16] a bit\n[1:01:17] >> I think it's a great word because\n[1:01:19] because if you don't trust something,\n[1:01:21] >> you know the the quote trust but verify,\n[1:01:23] but if you if you don't trust something,\n[1:01:25] you're going to really go into very deep\n[1:01:28] details verifying like every single line\n[1:01:30] of code. Um whereas at this point I'm\n[1:01:33] like I'm verifying the integration\n[1:01:36] tests. I have a couple of layering rules\n[1:01:38] that I define like do not create a\n[1:01:40] direct dependency between the repository\n[1:01:42] and the uh HTTP handler. Make sure that\n[1:01:45] you go through a service layer and the\n[1:01:47] service layer is used by HTTP because\n[1:01:49] we're using the services in many areas\n[1:01:50] not just the handlers and things like\n[1:01:52] that. So, so more and like those\n[1:01:54] layering type of things and those scary\n[1:01:57] refactors to be honest because like I\n[1:02:00] know that unit tests were working but\n[1:02:02] then now I suddenly have to completely\n[1:02:03] break down all the folders and and do\n[1:02:05] all of the logic all over the place.\n[1:02:07] >> Oh, sorry. My my wife has just messaged\n[1:02:10] me. I need to to help her out with the\n[1:02:12] kids.\n[1:02:13] >> Okay.\n[1:02:14] >> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Emergency.\n[1:02:17] Emergency.",

That's I'm just trying to\nthink of what we spoke last week so we\ndon't sound like broken records\nrepeating ourselves about\n>> last week. Gemini just came out. Um\n>> I just rewatched it before this call\n>> and we talked. Um\n>> yeah, but no, I forgot everything. Yeah,\nI I mentioned that I got some good time\nin on anti-gravity, the new\nIDE that Google launched.\n>> I haven't I haven't tried that.\nOh man, I I'm going to\n>> Yeah, I guess I guess we were I I think\nwe're we're both anthropic Claude fans,\naren't we?\n>> And guess who else since 20 hours ago\nsaid he is a fan who is a massive\nantiropic dude. quite famous\n>> andropic who\n>> T3 G3\n>> also Theo is like every time he posts a\nvideo for a while on Reddit people would\nbe like he's obviously an open AI shell\nhe gets private access to some of their\num models and um and and and basically\npeople he will never say anything\npositive about Antropic he hates\nAntropic um but he did a video was\nUh,\nit was\n>> Let maybe share your screen.\n>> Okay.\n>> I do watch a fair few Theo videos, but\nto be honest, I don't subscribe cuz he's\none of those. It's like like Primogen\nand Theo. Their content is good, but I\ndo find it like a bit too much actually.\nFor some reason, I I feel like only\ndipping in when I want to.\n>> You see it? So\nwe talked about AI for infrastructure\nengineers.\n>> Oh yeah,\n>> that's subscribe.\n>> But there was um I am subscribed. No,\n>> I don't know.\n>> And there was um\nI was going to I was hoping that the\ntitle would ring me a few more bells,\nbut I also rewatched what we discussed\nabout based infrastructure a little bit.\nBut basically this was posted.\nUm\nI tried to open it in a\nnew window.\n>> Not what I wanted to do.\n>> Oh my god. You don't have premium.\n>> Uh no. Why would I pay?\n>> You're an animal.\n>> Where's the\n>> It's not this one. This one is about\nopening eye. This one.\n>> I have a new favorite model.\n>> How many hours ago? 22 hours ago. So\nlittle.\n>> Oh, he's he is\nhe\n>> is this some sort of ironic?\n>> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He he goes\ninto great detail. Surprisingly has a\nlot of benchmarks. He does a very\ninteresting demonstrations comparing the\noutput of different models. He says Opus\n4.5 got massive boost in UI generation,\nthat the entropic models generally were\nnot good at that originally, um, but\nthat it's really much better at it right\nnow. So he has this um snitchbench\nrepository and he uses cursor with git\nwork trees and he says in this video\nfive times that get work trees are not\nworking in cursor and that they're\nworking on it but it makes his life a\nliving hell and every time he talks\nabout his workflow he mentions work\ntrees and how they're broken. It's\nreally um anyway\n>> yeah I mean there's some things about\ngit that I've never really enjoyed like\nsubm modules and things like that. Oh,\nsome modules stay away from, right? But\ngit works sound like very interesting in\nthe age of AI where you can just spin\noff a branch in a different subdirectory\nand have like a PC quickly, you know,\ndeveloped by\n>> you need it, don't you? You need it.\nYeah, even speckit idea is also to like\ndefine the specification and spin off in\nimplementation\num and so that you can do different PC's\nlike maybe you have the user stories and\nfunctional requirements but then you\nimplement it in like five different ways\nand different technologies different.\n>> So wait a minute I thought you were\nsaying that Theo was team open AI and\nnow he's anthropic.\nHe's yeah he he gets access and early\naccess to AI open AI and he does not get\nany access and then when he talks about\nit in this video he mentions like\nthere's a few other um\nAI channels that are benchmarking models\nthat are also not getting early access\nto the entropic models and he's happy to\nbe in the same boat as them. something\nlike Antropic is horrible. Um, but I've\ngot to give it to them. This opens 4.5\nis insanely good. And\n>> okay, sorry.\n>> He als he he also ranks here. He talks\nabout the the output the UI output of\nOpus and then he he gives his ranking\nhere of output ceiling versus\nconsistency and um he hasn't finished it\nthere. So, but to him he still says\nyeah. What does output ceiling mean?\n>> The best you can get out of it. Like\nlike sometimes you give it a prompt and\nit gives like a really amazing output.\nHe says a couple of times GPT 5.1 Pro\nreally beat Gemini 3 um by a mile. And\nthen\nthe problem is the consistency\num that you get from these models is\nnothing compared to open opus like oppus\nand son they are very consistent. So\nhe's reranking them on the right saying\nuh or left however is this mirrored? No\nit's not mirrored. Um yeah [snorts]\nanyway um but Gemini tree\nI think last time we talked I mentioned\nthat I had very limited access to Gemini\ntree because uh I used Google cloud code\nassist uh licenses. I have a Google\ncloud account. It's a personal one but\nyou can subscribe to um Gemini in GCP.\nSo you can run code assist and you can\nthen use it and you get access to like\nthe the Google cloud models but the way\nthat they release it to different\nsubscription plans is a little bit\ndifferent. So you can subscribe to\nGemini AI Pro or um and you can even get\nlike a massive promotion for 3 months or\nso at half the price or whatever it was\nto to use it to to that that Gemini\nGemini Gemini AI Pro subscription. But\nfor some reason to me it made more sense\ngiven I already have my my billing\naccounts in GCP to just use the the\nseats there. I basically\n>> was trying to see if I could use it.\nClicked for one month subscription\nbefore I knew it. I realized that that\nwas probably not the best way to do it.\nUh figured out how to assign a seat\nbecause they have users within Google\naccount Google cloud that you then have\nto allocate to licenses. You can do that\nautomatically. So when you sign into\n>> GCP is like project. So there's there's\na project concept and then and then then\nthere's a seed concept or something.\n>> Yeah. So on one one side it's really\ncool that you have so many ways to\nauthenticate and you can use an API key,\nyou can use the Gemini AI, you can use\nthis and that on the other side is they\nare not consistent in the way that\nthey're giving the different\nsubscriptions access to the new models.\nAnd so the only way I had access was\nthrough the anti-gravity\nuh IDE which is apparently just Windsor\nrebranded because if you search for\nstrings they still have the original\nWindsor strings in there apparently. But\nanyway, so um so that's and there it's\nfree access so it's nerfed right because\num it's against my accounts but the the\navailability of the model is constantly\nlike um to make sure my experience was\nnot unique and to have a bigger you know\nbackground around benchmarking I watched\nthree or four videos as you can see from\nmy uh\n>> from my my history around these latest\nmodel announcements.\n>> Right. Right.\n>> So,\n>> so my experience was horrible. Uh after\nthe first\n>> for Gemini, you're saying, right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah. After the first\n>> Sorry, who who owns who owns Wind Surf\nnow? The earlier comment you made.\n>> Okay. So there was a stream\n>> there was a stream of like um also a\nlive stream just 20 hours ago from the\nMastra people which building AI\nworkflows and they went a little bit\ninto the drama of windsurf because\nwindsurf was like the startup um and I\nthink the CEO or founder was poached\naway they were like negotiating a\ncontract with Google uh but then Google\ndidn't manage to acquire them afraid for\nantitrust lawsuits or thing. So they\njust took the CEO. He left his whole\nteam behind and all the IP.\nSo he joined Google within one one or\ntwo months.\nI don't know why. On the right my my\nsuggestions.\n>> So basically when Surf went from like a\nhuge valuation to to the CEO being\npoached. I guess that's kind of smart.\n>> I know. horrible for the the early like\nearly team because all of these guys\nprobably gave up a good amount of their\nlife working full stop on this startup\nand then the CEO just walks away with\nall the IP and the company is still\nthere. They're still employed but it's\nworth nothing or something like that.\n>> Yeah. So everybody hates that CEO. I did\nwatch I did watch a like a hacker news Y\ncominator interview with I think the CEO\nof Windsurf and I did find it\ninteresting how the company started by\nlike I think they were doing like GPU\ntype of 3D gaming cloud stuff and then\nthey pivoted into uh to Windsurf.\n>> Yeah. Um, so, so basically\nthey were saying that they got like 10\nseconds of good use out of it. They\nkicked off a plan and they immediately\ngot like 10 seconds after 10 seconds is\nGemini Tree just said, \"No, I'm\noverloaded.\" Um, or uh you reach your\nquota. Um, so for me, I feel like I got\na lot more out of Gemini tree initially.\nUm but what really made my impression\nbad over the last week is one that the\nway for me to get access to it is\nimpossible. Um I have to go on a waiting\nlist but I haven't like received an\napproval on the form to all go on the\nwaiting list. They have a question which\nis like are you contributing to Gemini\nCLI? I'm like no. So guess what you're\nnot going to get it. [laughter] I don't\nknow\n>> why questions.\n>> Why ask right? When I see that question,\nI'm already like, \"Yeah, okay.\"\n>> Okay,\n>> I guess not then.\n>> But then on the opposite, Opus released\nwas it yesterday for me? Like for me it\nwas yesterday. Was it for you yesterday?\nOpus the announcement of Antropic was\nyesterday, right?\n>> I don't know. It was fading days of\nfading. Maybe the day before yesterday,\nbut yeah,\n>> it was like Monday, right? Today's\nWednesday. Yeah, it was like Monday\nduring the day and I woke up on Tuesday\nand [snorts] I and it was released and\nandropic\nlitm I mean made it so simple right in\ncloud code you can go extra usage I mean\nyou can yeah you can go extra usage\nand it will immediately throw you into\nthe into your account management your\nbilling [snorts] uh page and you can\njust use your credit card because I'm\nalready a subscriber it already has my\nbilling um method there, right? So, I\ncan just click, okay, top up wallet and\nI immediately have like I don't know, I\nput in $30 uh equal to like a month\nsubscription, $13 and um and right away\nI have access to Opus straight up. I can\njust slash Oopus. There you go. 4.5.\nEven though I pay $20 a month or $30 a\nmonth in Singapore dollars\n>> uh for just the pro subscription, I can\nuse OPUS, but it's API uh charges. That\nmeans it's not like on your monthly uh\nbudget, you get charged by the call. And\nI thought like it's supposedly much more\ntoken efficient and therefore they say\nin terms of cost, it's almost similar to\nSA 4.5. That's what you get when you are\na Max Pro user. They say when you're Max\nPro, you use Opus. They slashed it by\nlike a third the price. So that's one of\nthe things T3 mentioned and Tropic\nsliced the price like crazy. So first\nthey made Opus 4.1 completely useless\nand forced everyone to use Sony 4.5 and\nthen\neveryone saying they were sitting on\nthis model until Gemini came out and\nthen the next week they released 4.5.\n>> Oh, nice. Yeah. So they can move\nquickly. Hey, can I just can I just\nshare my screen here?\n>> Yeah, sure. Sure. Um,\n>> so I'm a little bit puzzled by the way\nthings work. Like I I got access to\nClaude Opus through Gemini. I mean,\nsorry, through co-pilot\npretty quickly. You can see my screen,\nright?\n>> You use Yeah, Visual Studio. No, I don't\nthink I see your screen. Sorry.\n>> You don't? Oh, god. I\n>> [clears throat]\n>> Um,\nyou don't see it at all, do you?\nOkay. May maybe let me just try share\nagain.\n>> Did you click the button?\n>> Yeah, it says I'm screen sharing.\n>> Now I see your link shared inside the\nchat. You're trying to share Excalibraw.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, now I can see it.\n>> Okay. So,\nso like, okay, let's let's we can\nannotate this with some. So, so Gemini\n3. Oh, no. That's too that's too big.\nSo, Gemini 3 came out.\nI got that. They charge 1x and then of\ncourse uh Opus got released like a\ncouple of days later.\nI thought Opus was the was the, you\nknow, the the the clever big thinking\none. How come?\n>> So, basically, Haiku is now,\nif I understand that, cheaper, right? Or\nI think that is it.\n>> Haiku. Haiku was super cheap. Yeah, I\nthink this is promotional because and\nit's preview because I don't think I I\ndon't think Opus would be the same as\nSony 4.5. It's still more than so son\n4.5. Haiku is the cheap you know like in\npros haiku is a very short um body of\ntext. Son is longer and then opus is\nyour like your big life.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So uh I just I just think it's a bit\ncurious the way that they've presented\nit here. Like I'm I mean credit to VS\nCode for even showing these clawed\noptions very well. Like I know I know\nthat the GPT\nyou know open AI is owned by Microsoft\nVS code is Microsoft they do show their\ntheir own mod models first for some\nreason they throw in gro I I don't know\nwhy I don't even know know what Raptor\nis\n>> do you know what that is\n>> no\npreview\nit's just a curious state of affairs my\nVS code manage models uh dialogue.\nSo, did have you tried Opus? Like, do\nyou agree with what Theo said? Is it all\nhunky dory? There's no controversy.\n[gasps]\n>> You know, my opinion about like I don't\nhave a proper benchmark, but my\n>> just go go on vibes.\n>> Yes. On vibes,\nI think Opus is amazing. I mean, I'm I'm\nI'm 100% entropic right now. So, um like\nI have the\n>> I'm really considering like but I don't\nhave much else to cancel, but I want to\ncancel everything and just go in like on\nthe max plan, you know, $100 on Tropic.\nThere you go.\n>> Oh my goodness. [laughter]\n>> Yeah, because I mean I think this month\nI spent about 100 anyway. I spent\n>> speaking speaking of spending money. So,\nso basically I got an email from my\nemployer\nuh and they said that I'm limited to\nlike a 50 a soft limit of $50 with\nAnthropic, but for some reason the the\nwhole Anthropic UI is messed up. I can't\nsee how much my spend is\nand looking at dashboard.\n>> Um, let me just double check.\nLast time I logged in, I I just couldn't\nsee it. It's all in under this company\naccount and I couldn't get any\nvisibility.\n>> Okay.\n>> No.\n>> Yeah. It's a bit hard to know\n>> what you can do if you if they tell give\nyou an abstract number and they and\nthere's no way for you to check.\n>> Exactly.\nBut like for example, what I like I went\nI tried um here's another thing I wanted\nto share with you.\nI went nuts with um this agents feature\nbecause I just learned about it. I\ndidn't know about it. the picture that\nyou sent about the dependable thing.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> it's interesting.\n>> Yeah. So, I basically\nset up an agent\n>> to basically merge all the dependable\nbot PRs on like 300 repos.\n>> Smart idea. [laughter]\n>> But\n>> wait, you just pulled in shalloot\non every ripple. [laughter]\n[snorts]\n>> What?\nYou know the the worm that the\nnpm worm that\n>> Oh, no. Hopefully not.\n>> Hopefully not.\n>> What's his name? Shad Halute.\n>> Well, that's I don't know, right?\n>> Okay. So, let me just run you through\nthis uh prompt. So, use the GitHub CLI,\nwhich is the name of my agent, by the\nway. I'll show you the agent in a bit.\nto spawn agents in parallel to look at\nthe issues to each of my repos\nand look to merge dependabot and then\nI'm I just thought it was prude to do\nsomething like you know touch repo name\nonce done\nto ensure the repo isn't done again\nthen I went bananas going going through\nI think it launched 50 agents in\nparallel so this was like three or four\nit was like doing three or four or five\ntool calls each one for some reason.\n>> Is this haiku or son?\n>> Uh I was using haiku.\n>> Yeah, it's really fast.\n>> And so I when it was running, you can\njust imagine this is like 3045. It also\nshowed the token here. Now that's gone\ncuz I'm just I launched up to the resume\nthing right now.\n>> Don't you have it on your screenshot? I\nthink the screenshot you sent me has it.\n>> Yeah, may maybe.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> So it it went it did the job I think as\nbest as it it could. I mean, obviously\nit runs into conflicts and some things\ngot messed up, but all in all, it's\nquite a safe process.\nAbout like, I don't know, 10 minutes\ninto the whole process, this thing kind\nof blew me away. So, you can see that\nit's processed 45\num maybe another 100 or something like\nthat.\nAnd then like\nsort of like uh halfway through the\nprocess, it says, \"Let me create a\nscript\nto process all remaining repositories\nmore efficiently.\"\n>> That's good.\n>> And I was like, \"Holy shit.\"\n>> That's what a human would do. Right.\n>> Exactly. I was like, \"Holy [ __ ] I\ndidn't even\ntell it to do that, you know.\"\n>> No, but that's exactly what you and I\nwould do, right? We would start to do it\nmanually. We would always get like\nsimilar problems and kind of get a good\nfeel about like what works, what are the\nproblems we encounter and then we make a\nscript for it. And it's kind of like\nwhat it did.\n>> Yeah. I'm like I'm like you know my\nI was getting kind of hairs on the back\nof my head type of thing. Um and then\nand then it b then it kick uh then it\nkicks off the uh the shell script and\nruns it in the background and then it\ngives you and then it checks again\n>> and then it does a bit of a summary\n>> but okay what I wanted to show you this\nis that I I just don't have a how many\nit used a bunch of tokens but I don't\nactually know how many is there some\nclever what is the way of seeing the\ncontext window it's just like context\nisn't it\n>> yeah but like the context window is not\ngoing to tell you anything. It's usually\nthe slash usage thing, but that's so\nlimited now. It's just two bars. And\nit's so funny they went from showing how\nmuch you have used uh from how much you\nhave left back to how much you have\nused. It's Did you have Did you not\nwatch that whole situation with the bar?\nYou I think you were asking me or I you\nsent me.\n>> Yeah. Like there's a lot of controversy\naround that status line and everything\nlike that. I guess that they're I mean\nit doesn't inspire confidence when they\ndo [ __ ] like that, do it, does it?\nThey're trying to hide. Funny thing is\nwhat I saw on Reddit, somebody posted\nlike how come when I use cloud code on\nmy Mac um I get the the how much I have\nleft and when I use it on my um like my\nLinux box my DBN um it shows me how much\nI have used and some comment was like\nisn't it funny that like the DBN package\nadministrator refused to integrate this\n[laughter]\nchange and he didn't like it and now\nthey're back um like in the change log\nthey said like reverted the usage bar to\nthe original. But that's [snorts] one of\nthe comments that Tio said like um you\ndid a great job on Tropic. Um I'm open\nto talk. Yeah. As if they need you. But\nanyway, and then\n>> yeah, talk to me. Um\n>> I I want to move from open AI.\n>> Yeah, he needs the red carpet. He's he\nwas also constantly showing how much he\nspent like, oh, I've you know, spent one\nhour like, oh, it's $150 now. It's a lot\nof my pocket, but I'm happy to show you\nguys the benchmark. I mean, credit\nthough. It's an impressive benchmark and\nit the way that he's very quickly\nspinning up all these models with the\nsame tasks and showing them.\n>> So, how does he how does he know how\nmuch he's spending and I have absolutely\nno clue because because of the usage of\n>> because you're in an org account it\nlooks like like on mine. So, a while ago\nwe were thinking how can we track our\nusage properly and I was like yeah I\ndon't really have an idea. I just wait\nuntil it's done and I look at my usage.\nBut now I found a decent way which is on\nmy account in my billing page I can see\nexactly how much like pretty much live\num as it is running I can see little by\nlittle my week my hourly budget filling\nup and my weekly budget filling up and\nthen my extra usage like the wallets\nthat I I put in there also filling up\nwith open\n>> maybe can you give me like a a rule of\nthumb like for example this context\nwindow here I mean it's half full.\n>> There is a package called\n>> is is is a is a half full context maybe\nyou know two bucks and a full context\nabout four you know four bucks. Can I is\nthere some rule of thumb I can use?\n>> I think is really not the way to go for\nthis because um there's even new like\nwith Opus 4.5 they added new\ncapabilities into the cloud code shell\nthings like the ability to progressively\nsearch and expose tools to the model. Um\nthe ability for the model to you know\nthis whole blog post that I did about\nMCPS.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, but this is expressed here,\nright? This is expressed in the system\nprompt, isn't it?\n>> So basically this whole shell even has a\nnew functionality to automatically\ncompact the context. So you cannot go\noff like this context status uh diagram\nto determine how much you've currently\nused because they are changing how all\nof that work and this is not meant to\ndisplay your your your usage. There's a\nthere's a tab for usage. Well, let Oh, I\nforgot to show you the um the actual\nagent.\nSo, this is what a agent looks like.\nIt's it's in the docu agents directory.\nAnd then it's kind of like a a skill,\nbut you're supposed to specify tools and\nmodel. I I mean, maybe it's an optional\nthing to be honest. So, here, as I\nmentioned, I I specified Haiku. to be\nhonest, I grabbed this from um some guy\nI've been email email conversing with,\nguy named James.\nBut yeah, so this ba this agent\nbasically\nequips Claude to use the GitHub CLI,\nwhich is, you know, the GitHub CLI is\none of the best things about GitHub,\nright? You can go nuts with it.\n>> You also wrote a skill, right? You wrote\nthe GitHub action skill for work.\n>> Yeah, I did. I did that. Yeah. So, um,\nthat's also something\nI'm I'm a little bit confused between\nagents and skills and all the rest of\nit. I'm a little bit like and also my\nClaude when I run Claude. Um, I I need\nto uninstall beads because every time I\ngo slash command, it's like 99% bloody\nbeads commands.\n>> Absolutely. This get rid of beats MCP.\nIt's a complete disaster because they\ndon't have Isn't that I think it's the\nplugin that sets all this [ __ ] up.\n>> Oh, yeah. I didn't do that. All right, I\njust installed the BD CLI. I tried the\nMCP and I already uninstalled the\n>> manage. Okay. Okay, this is going. How\ndo you uninstall? Delete to uninstall.\nOkay, it's gone. And hopefully Oh man,\nstill\n>> so I've got a story about a about skills\ncuz I I've [clears throat] used actually\ncloud code the shell\nuses has built-in agents right since a\nfew releases ago. So when you go into\nplan mode often times when you prompt it\nto start planning launches agents.\n>> Oh my goodness.\n>> Oh, you have costs. I haven't seen that.\nThere you go.\n>> They have a aside from the usage now you\nhave an because I was every single CLI\nactually has a really nice summary.\nGemini CLI.\n>> But how come that how come that was so\nWait a minute.\nHow come this I guess it doesn't have\nthe my previous run does it?\n>> Probably not. No, this is probably your\ncost from this shell session. Even if\nyou restore a previous\n>> See, this is why I don't want my\ncommands to be polluted. That's the\nfirst time I just noticed this stuff.\n>> Yeah, you beats and the the same second\nyou see the command that you needed.\n>> Yeah. [laughter]\n>> Okay, so plugins pros and cons. Um same\nwith MCPS, right? But but we were just\ntalking about agents and and I was about\nto like share with you my experience.\nYou you also don't know what's the\ndifference between skills and agents.\n>> So basically agents actually are part of\nyour shell. They come come with it no\nmatter if you build them or not.\n>> Okay. So what's what agents are there\nalready then? Are you you suggesting\nthat\n>> the planning agents the explore agents?\nIf you go into agents without building\nany uh slash agents, you will see that\nbuiltin there's two agents at least.\nYeah. And I think they're adding more.\n>> No, no. Well,\n>> oh, built in. Okay. Sorry. [ __ ] I\n[snorts] just killed the share.\n>> Let me let me share my whole screen.\nHopefully I don't share anything insane.\n>> Um,\nyeah. So in agents, I've got my GitHub\nCLI agent there. And then then it's\nbuilt\n>> in agents general purpose\nstatus line setup.\n>> I ran that one.\n>> Oh, okay. Okay. And then it sets up the\nstatus line. Okay. What is it? That\nstatus line is kind of like by default\nit agents copies your bash shell status\nand then it shows your bash shell status\nline at the bottom.\nUh I think you just\n>> Oh, I supposed to\n>> Yeah.\n>> run.\n>> I think after a while would have come\nback and and tried to run it.\n>> You're auto compact. I have set that\noff.\n[snorts]\n>> Yeah, that's\n>> okay. So that's what did I just run\nthere? you wanted to do status line but\nlet not do that. Um so basically some\nagents are in there the explore agent\nfrom uses haiku to quickly go through\nall of the paths and make a summary of\nwhat's inside your repository. Um that's\nwhat sometimes I guess that's what it\nuses when you do your initial in it. It\nwill use the explore agent to quickly\nfind the data so not to waste money on\nSunday or things like that, right? And\nthen it has the um planning agent which\nwhen you ask it to go into plan mode, it\nwill maybe spawn an explorer and then it\nwill spawn a plan agent to build um look\nit gives it the context and it says like\nI have to do this thing. It's very\ninteresting because when you when you do\ncontrol O you see the actual prompt that\nit sends to the SP planning agent. So\nit's interesting to see I've been trying\nto leverage agents and spend them spawn\nthem the way that you've done but like\nwhat you've done with the GitHub CLI\nagent is really nice. I mean that's a\nreally good good use and you I'm happy\nfor you worked out because when I tried\nit it was a disaster. [gasps]\nUm and then skills. So I have a very\nvery very funny experience. um with\nskills.\n>> Okay. I'm I'm I'm trying to describe\njust to capture. Yeah, you're welcome to\nadd screenshots and other things to this\nexcal.\n>> I'm sure if I can, but basically what\nhappened was this. I um I spent like\nclose to $15\npretty much my whole monthly budget on\nOpus to generate a really extensive plan\num of a feature that I'm working on. And\nthen I was like, \"Okay, I I can't use\nmore than that, like because I'm I'm\nover budget.\"\n>> I I still don't understand how you can\nspend $50 like that. Okay, carry on.\n>> 15.\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> On API calls on Opus 4.5. And so I went\nto to say to to anti-gravity and asked\nit like okay here's a very extensive\nplan and here's the prompt that speckit\nprovides. It's a very detailed prompt\nlike do this, do this, read the\nresearch, read the plan and start\ngenerating tasks. Right? So I told you\nthat I I switched all of the prompts to\nuse uh beads to to create uh tasks\ninstead of generating a long markdown\nbecause then it gets lost when it needs\nto do the work and it basically dies as\nsoon as it tries to read the number of\ntasks it need to do and try to figure\nout what it has to complete. So beats\ndoes help me there. I do think it really\nhelps me to to create very focused\nsessions. Um, so I asked Gemini to with\nthe prompt that works really well with\nSonet and it did an absolutely horrible\njob. It created every single issue with\njust a title and a oneline description.\nNow the idea is that you can just read\nthat one task and you can just go off\nand do what you need to do. So that task\nneeds to have information about which\nfile to change, what to change, why to\nchange it, acceptance criteria,\nreferences to the plan and the research.\nI mean surely you could change to happen\n>> instructed it to keep to some sort of\ntemplate.\n>> Yeah. So that's the prompt, right?\nThat's the prompt I gave it. I gave both\nSon and Okay. So basically you told it\nto do it, but it it ended up just doing\none line\n>> and it did one line and I was like, how\nis it possible? How come Son 4.5 is so\nmuch better than Gemini 3, which is\nsupposed to be like the premier model\nright now from Google? And of course,\nwe're talking about skills, you can\nguess, I have a beat skill that I\ncompletely forgot about. So even though\nmy prompt was identical and it only\nshowed like use beats, create a task\nlike this.\n>> Oh, so that you're saying that the beads\nthe beads prompt messed up the the\nprocess or something or what? What I'm\nsaying is that son has an agent skill\ncapability where it like progressively\nlearns how to use beats and my prompt\nwas identical but behind the scenes\nwithin the shell environment or however\nthe cloud code is built because it's\nclosed source somehow son creates very\ndetailed issues and maybe I can share my\nscreen actually.\n>> Yeah, sure. I'm curious.\n>> Okay, so basically Claude came up\nClaude won because of of beads and\nknowing the stuff. Okay. But that still\ndoesn't explain why Gemini did these\noneline things, but anyway.\n>> Okay, I can I can explain it. I actually\nsent you a detailed video about\n>> Oh, yeah. Actually, I haven't read your\nchat very closely. Let me just read it\nnow.\n>> Uh,\nphone a farmer.\nThat's uh apparently a Belgian dude that\nworks for Austra that um is one of the\nlike original Gatsby developers and he's\none of the early\nhe's Belgian and he he he's like the\nfirst far farmer founder\nmembers of of Mastra and Master is a\nreally interesting um TypeScript only\nframework to build agent workflows. So,\nit's a really cool uh framework that I\nthat I did a conference talk about uh\nback in March. So, you can\n>> Oh, by the way, are you going to be in\nBelgium soon because there's a there's a\ngood conference at the end of the year\nor the new year.\n>> I I I was telling so so I went to\nSingapore three times and I went to\nKoala Lumpur and I was telling my wife,\nlet me up for conferences and I was\ntelling I'm going to Belgium in in\nJanuary or um and then she was look the\nlook she gave me I I knew there was no\nway. [laughter]\n>> [ __ ] Okay. When was the last time you\nwere in Belgium then?\n>> Almost. I don't know. Um I can here.\nThis is Beats. [laughter]\n>> Okay. Let's\n>> distracting me. Okay. So So this\n>> Yeah. So this is a a cheap Beats UI.\nIt's pretty cool actually.\n>> Was this your UI cuz you one?\n>> I started coding.\n>> Um this one. So there's a discussion on\nBeats where they talked about different\nUIs. It's out of scope for the project\nbecause they don't want to pollute it.\nIt's a beats is meant to be a CLI text\nfocused tool for agents to use. UI is\nout of scope and it's hard to maintain\nand puts with maintenance. So they\ncompletely separate the beats UIs.\nTherefore, there's quite a few of them.\n>> This one is actually quite actively\nmaintained. I've\n>> Yeah. Anyway, um so it keeps track of\nall of the issues. It works directly\nwith the beat socket, so it's pretty\nfast. Um the way I've instructed it to\nuse beats in my task generation is to\ncreate epics for my big features and\nthen to create sub like features for the\nuser stories. So I get these nice flows\nof like these are my two features I need\nthat I that I was working on and and\nhere I have like the different phases.\nSo this is what opus generated.\n>> No, this is what Gemini generated. I\nmean, if we're going to compare that to\nthis, which is way more in line with the\nactual prompt, which is like user story\none, user story 2, and and when you look\nat them, you have the graph and\ndependencies.\n>> Oh, man. This makes me this is so much\nfaster than Jira. I could cry.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]\n>> I mean, Jira is so bad.\n>> Yes. So, so this is one of the use the\nthe story that um the the user story\ncaptured by Gemini, right? oneline\ndescription automatically generate and\nthen in the dependencies are all the\ntasks that belong to this user story. So\none of these like for example this one\nwas generated by Gemini which uh in the\noverview we can see it's just like oh\nadd this um Golang packet library to to\nautomatically infer this the JSON schema\nfrom JSON data sample\n>> uh add this into a new infer service\ninto internal. It doesn't even say like\nit's part of the grid API because this\nrepository has many different things.\nSo, so this is absolutely disgusting. If\nI want to give this to Haiku, it's going\nto completely it's going to go bonkers\nand and completely mess up my code,\nright? Um,\n>> so this is one of created and then this\nI show you the other one now created by\num\nby like this one for example is created\nby Son. Oh no, this one is\n>> you need you need to you need to add a\nlabel that is created by um\nNo.\n>> Gemini or so many or um where is it?\n>> Yeah. Can you can you alter your\nintegration skill?\n>> Make sure you label which which model\nput this thing in.\n>> That's actually not a bad idea because\nthere's the author part here and I can\nsee sometimes cloud puts itself as the\nassigne and that actually keeps it like\nnice to see. Um but integrate inference\ninto state upload update proto\ndefinitions update goal schema is that\nokay this is so in the video I sent you\nI cut out all of the me searching which\none was created by which model uh and\nit's really neat like the difference but\nhere you can see the difference right\nthis is how I want an issue to look like\nwhich is update the go SDK schema uh\nsource field um so that it lives here\nright um this is the description then\nthis is another flag that beat says to\ndesign right this is the changes you\nneed to make there's some notes um which\nhasn't had any notes and then there's\nthe acceptance criteria output key um is\nlike this this is the the final result\nand this is kind of like what I want\nlike the big planner model opus\ngenerates this type of design and then I\nwant to give it to like a very fast and\ndumb model and if they are not if they\nare not going outside and too creative\nthen hiku normally would end up with\nexactly to the spec and then I would be\nable to like everything would perfectly\nCool. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\nThat's a really good optimization. So,\njust to replay my understanding, you you\nget Opus to plan everything, put\neverything in beads as as task and then\nyou then you spin out haiku agents to\nimplement it.\n>> Yeah. So, beads beats allows models to\nfocus on the tasks and then you can kill\na session and you can just spin up a new\none, tell it to read this is your work.\nYou need this is your scope right here\nand then it goes off and does that\nthing, right? Right. And it keeps\n>> cool. So, how do you\n>> So, how come Gemini was so horrible at\nit, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Um, so in anti-gravity, this was\nactually the output from Gemini. Um,\n>> it's just anti-gravity right here.\n>> Yeah, this is anti-gravity.\n>> So, it's just exactly like VS Code, I\nguess.\n>> Yeah, they're all VS Code clones. They\n>> um\n>> I your animal I can't believe you have\nmini map.\n>> That That's how I judge people.\n>> Mini Map is great. I use it all the time\nto scroll. Whenever I see an error, I\njust click on it and then I'm right\nthere. I see it. It's really nice the\ncolor coding of it. Yeah, I really like\nit.\n>> Okay. Um I don't like mini.\n>> So this is the speckit. This is the\nspecket task um that you you need to\ngive in anti-gravity. Again, you see how\nmany stupid folders I have. I have\nGemini, I have codeex, I have cloud, and\nnow I have to add another one for\nagent/workflows because that's what\nanti-gravity uses. And they're all the\nsame. They're all exactly the same. Now\nthe problem is here when I say like this\nis how you use CLI calls. This is how\nyou create a feature an epic right? This\nis how you create a user story. Um and\nyou add the specs like this and this is\nthe face.\n>> Okay. So you're templating a little bit.\n>> Yeah. But as you can see the only thing\nI say is you give it a title, you give\nit a description and nothing else. And I\nwas like huh. So maybe this is my\nproblem. How did I have a difference\nwith what I give son? And I go to son\nand it's exactly the same. You just give\nit a description and there's no\ninformation about giving it design notes\nor acceptance criteria, right? So,\n>> okay. So, it must have pulled out some\ncontext from your from your user profile\nor something.\n>> Yeah. So, so you put\nyou put this uh under my home directory.\nI don't know if you can see it in the\nterminal.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Claude. Yeah. I'm I'm always\non on I'd like to keep everything on a\nproject level. I hate to put things in\nmy home directory. I absolutely agree\nwith you because I want to check this\ninto to git so if anyone pulls it down\nthey can get the exact same experience\nright uh but anyway this is how\napparently when I installed this is how\nskills worked I don't know if right now\nyou can do it at the project level for\nskills but issue creation is here\n>> nice\n>> and issue creation is very detailed\n>> design fields acceptance criteria\n>> yeah this is so good\n>> oh my god I did I completely forgot\nabout it right and and and So I I didn't\neven know like that.\n>> So mystery solved, right? So be so\nGemini is not that bad.\n>> You can't be blamed.\n>> So at that point I think Gemini my first\nintuition was like Gemini is really good\nat following the instructions because\nanother thing that's different between\nthe two is that here they are perfectly\nlike this. Use a story colon and then\nthe name. But I also just noticed now\nwhen we're talking about it here it's\nlike phase 2 phase B to B. Why is it so\ndifferent?\num why are they not like following the\nsame? Because if I look at at um any\nother issues in the um epics in the\nback. So this is some problem with this\nthis uh this this UI. I can't go back to\nthe old epics to show you how they\nlooked. Once they're closed, they're not\nhere anymore. Um also I can't show you\nthe comments. Um so on a lot of these I\nsolved it by letting Sony add comments\nwith missing design documents. Uh but\nyeah, so now I just noticed as well that\nI actually give it the sample is like\nthis, right? It's like face setup.\nActually, it is like this story US1.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> So, it does put the story on it, but\nYeah.\n>> Well, this is cool. I [snorts]\n>> Oh, man. I I just love that that I need\nto sync my work Jira into Beads or\nsomething. I did see someone developed a\nplugin or something. So,\n>> I'm I'm like I think 10 versions behind\nBeats by now, right? Because this thing\nmoves so fast. Um, and then when I look\nat the change logs, it's like um new\nfeature, then two two commits later or\nnew release with fix and revert. And\nthen I see commits like um\nfix uh like corrupt data issue. And I\nwas like, okay, I don't want to update\n[laughter] cuz it's like it works.\nIt's moving too fast. I don't want to\nlike spend a day to move to a new\nversion. And then also I have to make\nsure my skills updated. I have to make\nsure my templates are updated with the\nright. It's such a cool time right now.\nSo like I wanted to maybe just touch on\num\non I mean we we are early adopters.\nIs the rest of I was just curious to ask\nif the rest of your company or your your\nteam is is using the same stuff as you\nor or it's not not not yet really.\n>> So this is where we talk. So last time\nyou one thing you mentioned to me was\nSteve Jagger's talk at the summit where\nhe mentioned about people that do not\nadopt AI significantly have a\ndisadvantage and there's a big problem\nin open AI where um they don't know how\nto do the reviews because they cannot\ncompare somebody that does use AI\nagainst somebody who does not use AI and\nyou hate and I watch\n>> I don't know if you noticed that that\nClaude also published this like paper on\nproductivity gains\n>> you shared it with me as well. Yeah,\n>> it was I think it was quite a big number\nlike speeds up individual tasks by 80%.\nI mean that's\n>> the thing is one of the first lines in\nthe in this paper is like we asked Sonet\nto analyze and Sony came up with these\nhypothetical [laughter] goals and I'm\nlike\n>> we as we asked Sonet to analyze the\nproductivity gains of Sonet.\n>> Yeah. I mean like one of the things I\nalways get from son is like it's going\nto take 3 4 days to build this thing or\none of like two weeks and so on. Um\n>> well you asked it to estimate.\n>> No I don't ask it every single time you\nask it to plan. May maybe it's in my\nspec kit prompts again right I'm using\nthese tools I don't know\n>> okay your context is polluted then more\nthan mine at least.\n>> Well it's it's been effective. Um but\nbut it's kind of funny because another\nthing that happens since we spoke is\nthe research preview of cloud code web\nran out and on on Sunday, right? So I\nhad like we spoke maybe on Tuesday and I\nhad like a week to and I only I was\nliterally rushing. So in to maximize the\nuse. So usually I use specit right I I\nbuild out these big plans. So, I went to\nthe cloud code web research preview and\non the mobile app while I'm at, you\nknow, um a restaurant to watch the F1 uh\nLas Vegas. I was on my phone uh specking\nout a feature for my project in cloud\ncode uh web uh or actually on the on the\nmobile app and and and and there's no\nspecit there's no beats in that\nenvironment, right? It's a very sandbox.\nSo how how the hell were you doing that?\nit kind of what I wanted to to say was\nlike without specit without all of this\nlike what you just said context polluted\nthings just give the tool in its like\nnatural environment and I think that\nthey were triing opus in this\nenvironment too to be honest um they\nthey tell everyone here's $250 give it\nsome task we control the environment and\nwe'll see how son and you know how they\ndo trials right so so it gave me really\ngood results um so Then\nI wanted to adopt this one because this\none is quite significant right I want to\nbasically what I'm working on is on the\nterraform state management whenever you\ndo terapform apply and you have some\noutputs I want to capture a schema\naround those outputs so it will it will\nstore a JSON schema so if you're\nbuilding some other infrastructure\nsomewhere else you can pull down that\nJSON schema from the other state and you\ncan code against that because that's\nwhat you can expect that the outputs\nwill look like and and it will also\nchange right if if the if the output\nschema changes it will it will flag it\nit will say like yeah the values change\nyou need to replan but not only that the\nschema changed so you may may have like\ncomplete breakage when you consume these\noutputs right so so it's a quite a big\nfeatures with a lot of um capabilities\nin there so the initial thing that I\nasked while I was in in uh watching F1 I\nasked chat GPT like I've got this API um\nI want to do like I want people to be\nable to register the shape of those\noutputs. Um, my primary library is in\nTypescript and they have these\ndefinition files and TypeScript is a\ngreat language to defining schemas. Um,\nhowever, not everyone is using\nTypeScript. Um, and it would be annoying\nthat you have to define a TypeScript\ninterface. Um, although I like the the\nway of writing TypeScript is way more\nnicer than than defining JSON schema in\nmy opinion. Uh, but I thought maybe to\nkeep it simple, TypeScript can easily go\nto JSON schema. uh maybe there's some\nfidelity loss and not exactly the same\nbut you can go between them. So I\nthought like JSON schema seems like the\nbest option to go across languages cuz\nthen you can have JSON schema supporting\neverything Python um and everything. So\na little bit a little back and forth\nbetween me and open eye which is really\nmore like a rubber duck at that point\nright he just says yeah sure go with\nJason\n>> great you are great [laughter]\n>> absolutely also shadow conspiracy\nanyway um so so so that was the first\nstep right uh identifying how uh like\nwhat how do we capture the schema um and\nthis this whole inference thing wasn't a\nthing I was just like I want to give\npeople the ability to just post like an\nendpoint to post what the output shape\nwill be like and and then we can look at\nlike validating it right so but there's\nI was thinking to myself this is so\ncomplicated for 100% there's 100 like\nedge cases and scenarios that I'm not\ntaking into account but I think that's\nwhat's great about Sonet um and this is\none of the things that I shared in a\nvideo with you as well is that I ask son\nto do these things in a web console you\nknow using my phone with a very basic\ndescription um and it gives me prompting\nwhich kind of works. Um but then what\nhappened is when I got home I was like\nit only implemented half of it. For\nexample, it didn't do the schema\nvalidation part. It it it give the\nendpoint for people to post the schema\nbut it didn't give an like ability to\nwhen you do Terraform apply it doesn't\ntrack if the schema validation is is is\nstill valid for those outputs. So I was\nlike oh that's missing. Um and so I\ndecided that I wanted to adopt this\nbranch created by cloud code with\nspecit. So I I I wrote a special prompt\nlike and modify all the scripts which is\nlike this this branch was created\noutside of specit\nlook at all of the existing work that\nhas been done and then create a a\nfeature like description and then also I\nasked Opus to review it from like an\ninfrastructure um you know consultant\nengineer uh what are the day two\noperations that you know may be issues.\nFor example, we we designed the feature\nto track the JSON schema per state per\noutput. But I'm like, \"Yeah, but the\nnetwork goes from defaf to prod. So the\nschema should be the same. So why do I\nattach the schema to the state output?\"\nAnd um and he's like, \"Yeah, absolutely.\nBut I [laughter]\nI'm always like the devil's advocate.\nI'm going to tell it we should make it\nglobal.\" And he was like,\n>> \"Yeah.\" Okay. So just just to summarize\nwhat you were saying to me is that\n>> is that\n>> you were you watching F1 you're on\nclaude code mobile you you you developed\nsome ideas opus or son shows that it's\nmuch better\n>> and then you were able to adopt it in\nyour your spec kit flow that your b your\nmobile session effectively right\n>> yeah yeah yeah um I was able to clone\nthe branch adopt it with the speech\nworkflow that goes in through detailed\nuser story and edge case analysis and\nthen identifies what was done and wasn't\nisn't done high priority to\n>> I mean I'm trying I'm trying to find\nreasons not to use my mobile but yeah\nokay awesome awesome\n>> yeah um but yeah\n>> I wanted to quickly ask since you you're\nshowing the beads UI here\nlike\none thing\none thing I don't have good visibility\nof which is which is of course why\nproject managers love to look at Jira or\num Pivotal or whatever the those things\nare called. How quickly are you munching\nthrough these tasks? Do you have a\nvelocity or something like that? Like\nhow do you measure?\n>> I really like beats in the way that it\ntries to capture it tries to be a local\nJira. It gives you stats. It gives you\nrundown. And it gives you a chart.\nThere's a whole bunch. Yeah, there is BT\nstats. Yes, it it tells you how long is\ninitial.\n>> Can Can you show me some stats?\n>> Yeah, but like like I said, I've used\nCloud Code web for a while, so Oh, it's\nnot going to be here. Hold on.\n>> Oh, yeah. I think I'd noticed the BD\nstats command, but I'm\n>> There is a BD stat using it in anger\nyet. [snorts]\n>> Oh, I I need to get my prompt to do a\ncarriage return like yours.\n>> Yeah, there's the average lead time.\nWhat does what does that mean? That\nmeans it takes uh 60 hours for something\nto get done or what does that mean?\n>> Yeah. Um don't ask me because I don't\nuse these. But your question was are\nthere stats and there are um there are\nrelated to to hours and time because it\nkeeps track of when an issue was created\nand when an issue was closed um and\nthings like that. Um it has quite a lot\nof things like what you would expect.\nThis is why when I was talking to you\nabout building a UI for this is like I\nkind of was inspired by Trello, right?\nBecause you have these little cards, you\nhave the labels, you have the comments,\nyou have\n>> what?\n>> Travel.\n>> Inspired by\n>> Trello. Trello. You mean Trello, right?\n>> Trello that was acquired.\n>> Yeah. Like a camb board or whatever.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. Which was acquired by Atlassian\nunfortunately.\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> But that that's super cool. Um, I\nbasically at the back of my mind during\nour conversation, I'm I'm I'm just\nthinking about the the human aspect\nbecause I feel supercharged by AI. Um,\nbut I'm just thinking like, you know, in\nin a corporate environment,\nhow does this work with team members?\nHow do you\n>> Yeah.\n>> rationalize the productivity? How do you\ntrain people? All these things are just\nfloating in my mind right now. That's\nwhat you were asking earlier and I\ndiverted to the talk from Steve Yagi\nabout um about how\n>> Oh yeah, like senior staff engineers. I\nlove that.\n>> And what happened was the craftsman were\ndoing the same thing our staff engineers\nare doing today.\n>> No,\nthat's word for word, right? That's what\nthey say.\n>> I love that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then he say word\nfor word.\n>> Word for word, by the way. And the whole\nroom left. But then uh Jean Kim also\ntalked about you know the Dora reports\nand and the work they do there where\nthey um identified and significant I\nthink the Dora report did say that there\nwasn't like a performance improvement\nbut one of the things that he\nhighlighted and I think was very\nrelevant to the talk that we had last\ntime which is that AI usage is a skill\nthat you become more confident in the\nmore you use it. Yeah,\n>> right.\n>> When you never used it, you're going to\nuse an LLM. You're not really familiar\nwith how to prompt it. It's going to\ngive you something that looks good, but\nwhen you poke through it, it's actually\ngarbage and you're immedately going to\nuse the trust,\n>> but you don't know how to validate it.\n>> It definitely rewards people who spend\ntime using it. Like I I was going to say\nthat like what you were doing by trying\ndifferent models,\n>> by using work trees to try the things\nthat that Theo is doing, like the more\nyou do that, the more you you almost\nresurrect an old project and just try\nagain.\n>> I really think it's\n>> the more you're going to learn, right?\nThe more investment in time. It's it's\nreally changing the workflow of a\nsoftware engineer.\n>> Um\ncrazy\n>> way more towards review part which I\nalways thought was a great part of it\nthough. Um I had this\n>> well you say review but I'm I think more\nlike it's more of like an orchestration\nthing. I feel like it's a pipeline like\nyou got to go back or you\n>> it's both of them\n>> both you need to know how to prompt and\nfeed the information and keep the\ncontext st so that it can be focused and\ndelivers a task. Although that the tools\nwill more and more be better at that\nbecause right now Opus is doing a lot of\nthings like automatically compacting\ntool finding the tools relevant and\nexecuting them correctly which is less\nand less on you and more on the tool\nright but on the other side so you need\nto orchestrate it but you need to be\nable to capture the requirements\nfine-tune them and um you know review\nbasically review what the model is\ntelling you are the usea user stories\nreviewing what the edge cases are\nscoping it down making sure that is like\nthat's acceptable for what I'm trying to\ndeliver um you know talking to your um\nstakeholders to make sure that we are\nokay with like it working this way and\nnot doing that part cuz that's going to\nbe and that's one thing I really liked\nabout Opus cuz after I had it like\ngenerate all of the things I I give it a\nI should have saved the prompt which is\nlike okay look look for sentences that\nlook simple on paper but have a huge\nimplication in terms of complexity that\nthey add and I give an example which is\nlike one of the sentences that the model\nloves to loves to put in these\nrequirements is like make sure that the\nuser that the error messages are very\ndetailed about what's going wrong and\nthat the user knows like how to react\nand and work on the error message,\nright? It sounds great. Yeah, actually\nsounds great. And then you get to the\nimplementation part or you do a review\nand then I use another model to do the\nreview and it keeps tripping up on this.\nIt's like this is not clear like what\ndoes it mean? What is what is an\nactionable error message? and and it\ngoes crazy and then you have to like and\nand and I basically asked it and in this\ncase, right, this is this is kind of MVP\nand I'm okay with the with the error\nmessage just being a log in the server\nand and just being like a red bar basic\nuh feedback that's didn't work. Um and\nand then Opus went through all of the\nspecs and immediately highlighted like\nfive six cases where this is kind of\nlike overkill for an MVP. this is kind\nof like this might be really have big\nimplications uh in terms of like yeah I\nI love that one um you know because\nthat's my biggest problem like scoping\ndown these models um so that's the first\npart right being able to to to control\nthe context keep the\n>> I still don't actually understand how\nyou can bugger off for for five you know\nlike weeks ago I think you maybe\nexaggerating like you just get some some\nyour your tasks together and then you go\nto the gym for 5 hours and then you come\nback and the work is done like I mean\nthat doesn't how that doesn't sound\nexaggerating uh that was about one\nfeature which is adding labels to\nterraform state and then giving a query\nengine to be able to query the labels\nright and I spent two days on going\nthrough the specs and the user stories\nand selecting the Golang library that\nallowed you to build expressions for\nthose labels and and it's kind of a\nsmall scope compare that to building a\nwhole authentication system with OIDC\nand and and keep\nRight. So, so I kind of didn't realize\nhow how very scoped and narrow that\nparticular story that I gave you was\nbecause I I felt like\n>> I guess\n>> I I I got a I get a I got a little bit\nobsessed. Well, I I was captivated by by\nthis whole idea that you can walk away\nfrom the computer and it's doing work\nfor you while you're asleep or\nsomething. But I think in practice that\ndoesn't is not really the case because\nyou know models and agents are getting\nfaster and faster. It's it's all the\nblock. It's not it's there's no real\noptimization there. The optimization is\npurely in your prompting, your workflow,\nyour review.\n>> Yeah. So, so I I I do always tend to\nwalk away when I see that the model has\nkind of kicked off in a loop and is kind\nof working on things and I don't want to\nsit here and just watch it at that point\nwhen I'm kind of sure that it's it's\nokay. So, I I walk away from my machine\na lot more and I decide that I'm going\nto go to the gym and I'm gone for an\nhour and I come back. I don't know how\nlong it ran, right? But it pretty much\ngot to a state where it was like, \"Oh,\nI'm approaching context limits. Let me\nsummarize and and see what I've done.\"\nUm, and things like that. So,\n>> I mean, you must go also yolo because\nwhen I when I was running that agent\nthing, it kept on asking me for prompts,\nyou know, all throughout the session.\nAnnoyingly,\n>> it permission. uh\n>> modals, right?\n>> So funny, I never had it delete my home\nuser directory. I've never had it like\nget hard reset anything. I don't give it\naccess to any databases. Um so I've\nhaven't had those issues.\n>> But I've noticed that the CLI prompts\nnow like when I go into codeex and you\ngo to approvals and you go to like give\nit full access in codeex before it was\nlike oh okay you give me full access\ngreat. Now it goes like are you sure it\nmay completely destroy your machine? Are\nyou sure you want to do this? I'm like,\nwhoa, whoa, you're scaring me now.\nBefore it was just okay, but I guess\n>> go going back to Jean Kim, I just\nnoticed I have a book by by Jean Kim\nright next to me. This the Accelerate\nbook. Accelerate.\n>> I don't know if you read that one. I\nmean, Jean Kim is a a legend. So, so\njust just to repeat what you said that\nJean Kim said, to be honest, I didn't\nwatch Jean Kim's presentation. So he's\nsaying that the more time\n>> people like us spend spend with working\nout working on these things, the more\n>> the more they trust it.\n>> Yeah. Well, it's not so much trust. It's\nmore it's the more\n>> he says trust\n>> comp competent we get too I suppose\n>> I guess but it's more also about like\nletting like trusting what it's doing.\nIt's okay knowing where to look for what\nyou know are like the areas where it\nwill mess up.\n>> Yeah. I guess trust trust is a bit is a\nbit wishy-washy, isn't it? It's not it's\na bit\n>> I think it's a great word because\nbecause if you don't trust something,\n>> you know the the quote trust but verify,\nbut if you if you don't trust something,\nyou're going to really go into very deep\ndetails verifying like every single line\nof code. Um whereas at this point I'm\nlike I'm verifying the integration\ntests. I have a couple of layering rules\nthat I define like do not create a\ndirect dependency between the repository\nand the uh HTTP handler. Make sure that\nyou go through a service layer and the\nservice layer is used by HTTP because\nwe're using the services in many areas\nnot just the handlers and things like\nthat. So, so more and like those\nlayering type of things and those scary\nrefactors to be honest because like I\nknow that unit tests were working but\nthen now I suddenly have to completely\nbreak down all the folders and and do\nall of the logic all over the place.\n>> Oh, sorry. My my wife has just messaged\nme. I need to to help her out with the\nkids.\n>> Okay.\n>> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Emergency.\nEmergency.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:22]\nCool, man. That's I'm just trying to think of what we spoke last week so we don't sound like broken records repeating ourselves about >> last week. Gemini just came out. Um >> I just rewatched it before this call >> and we talked. Um >> yeah, but no, I forgot everything. Yeah, I I mentioned that I got some good time in on anti-gravity, the new IDE that Google launched. >> I haven't I haven't tried that. Oh man, I I'm going to >> Yeah, I guess I guess we were I I think we're we're both anthropic Claude fans, aren't we? >> And guess who else since 20 hours ago said he is a fan who is a massive antiropic dude. quite famous >> andropic who >> T3 G3 >> also Theo is like every time he posts a video for a while on Reddit people would be like he's obviously an open AI shell he gets private access to some of their um models and um and and and basically people he will never say anything positive about Antropic he hates Antropic um but he did a video was Uh, it was >> Let maybe share your screen. >> Okay. >> I do watch a fair few Theo videos, but to be honest, I don't subscribe cuz he's one of those. It's like like Primogen and Theo. Their content is good, but I do find it like a bit too much actually. For some reason, I I feel like only dipping in when I want to. >> You see it? So we talked about AI for infrastructure engineers. >> Oh yeah, >> that's subscribe. >> But there was um I am subscribed. No, >> I don't know. >> And there was um I was going to I was hoping that the title would ring me a few more bells, but I also rewatched what we discussed about based infrastructure a little bit. But basically this was posted. Um I tried to open it in a new window. >> Not what I wanted to do. >> Oh my god. You don't have premium. >> Uh no. Why would I pay? >> You're an animal. >> Where's the >> It's not this one. This one is about opening eye. This one. >> I have a new favorite model. >> How many hours ago? 22 hours ago. So little. >> Oh, he's he is he >> is this some sort of ironic? >> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He he goes into great detail. Surprisingly has a lot of benchmarks. He does a very interesting demonstrations comparing the output of different models. He says Opus 4.5 got massive boost in UI generation, that the entropic models generally were not good at that originally, um, but that it's really much better at it right now. So he has this um snitchbench repository and he uses cursor with git work trees and he says in this video five times that get work trees…\n\n[slide:2] [5:02–15:47]\nthere. So, but to him he still says yeah. What does output ceiling mean? >> The best you can get out of it. Like like sometimes you give it a prompt and it gives like a really amazing output. He says a couple of times GPT 5.1 Pro really beat Gemini 3 um by a mile. And then the problem is the consistency um that you get from these models is nothing compared to open opus like oppus and son they are very consistent. So he's reranking them on the right saying uh or left however is this mirrored? No it's not mirrored. Um yeah [snorts] anyway um but Gemini tree I think last time we talked I mentioned that I had very limited access to Gemini tree because uh I used Google cloud code assist uh licenses. I have a Google cloud account. It's a personal one but you can subscribe to um Gemini in GCP. So you can run code assist and you can then use it and you get access to like the the Google cloud models but the way that they release it to different subscription plans is a little bit different. So you can subscribe to Gemini AI Pro or um and you can even get like a massive promotion for 3 months or so at half the price or whatever it was to to use it to to that that Gemini Gemini Gemini AI Pro subscription. But for some reason to me it made more sense given I already have my my billing accounts in GCP to just use the the seats there. I basically >> was trying to see if I could use it. Clicked for one month subscription before I knew it. I realized that that was probably not the best way to do it. Uh figured out how to assign a seat because they have users within Google account Google cloud that you then have to allocate to licenses. You can do that automatically. So when you sign into >> GCP is like project. So there's there's a project concept and then and then then there's a seed concept or something. >> Yeah. So on one one side it's really cool that you have so many ways to authenticate and you can use an API key, you can use the Gemini AI, you can use this and that on the other side is they are not consistent in the way that they're giving the different subscriptions access to the new models. And so the only way I had access was through the anti-gravity uh IDE which is apparently just Windsor rebranded because if you search for strings they still have the original Windsor strings in there apparently. But anyway, so um so that's and there it's free access so it's nerfed right because um it's against my accounts but the the availability of the model is constantly…\n\n[slide:3] [15:26–26:10]\nit's just a curious state of affairs my VS code manage models uh dialogue. So, did have you tried Opus? Like, do you agree with what Theo said? Is it all hunky dory? There's no controversy. [gasps] >> You know, my opinion about like I don't have a proper benchmark, but my >> just go go on vibes. >> Yes. On vibes, I think Opus is amazing. I mean, I'm I'm I'm 100% entropic right now. So, um like I have the >> I'm really considering like but I don't have much else to cancel, but I want to cancel everything and just go in like on the max plan, you know, $100 on Tropic. There you go. >> Oh my goodness. [laughter] >> Yeah, because I mean I think this month I spent about 100 anyway. I spent >> speaking speaking of spending money. So, so basically I got an email from my employer uh and they said that I'm limited to like a 50 a soft limit of $50 with Anthropic, but for some reason the the whole Anthropic UI is messed up. I can't see how much my spend is and looking at dashboard. >> Um, let me just double check. Last time I logged in, I I just couldn't see it. It's all in under this company account and I couldn't get any visibility. >> Okay. >> No. >> Yeah. It's a bit hard to know >> what you can do if you if they tell give you an abstract number and they and there's no way for you to check. >> Exactly. But like for example, what I like I went I tried um here's another thing I wanted to share with you. I went nuts with um this agents feature because I just learned about it. I didn't know about it. the picture that you sent about the dependable thing. >> Yeah. So, >> it's interesting. >> Yeah. So, I basically set up an agent >> to basically merge all the dependable bot PRs on like 300 repos. >> Smart idea. [laughter] >> But >> wait, you just pulled in shalloot on every ripple. [laughter] [snorts] >> What? You know the the worm that the npm worm that >> Oh, no. Hopefully not. >> Hopefully not. >> What's his name? Shad Halute. >> Well, that's I don't know, right? >> Okay. So, let me just run you through this uh prompt. So, use the GitHub CLI, which is the name of my agent, by the way. I'll show you the agent in a bit. to spawn agents in parallel to look at the issues to each of my repos and look to merge dependabot and then I'm I just thought it was prude to do something like you know touch repo name once done to ensure the repo isn't done again then I went bananas going going through I think it launched 50 agents in parallel so this was like three or four it was…\n\n[slide:4] [25:49–36:31]\ncuz I I've [clears throat] used actually cloud code the shell uses has built-in agents right since a few releases ago. So when you go into plan mode often times when you prompt it to start planning launches agents. >> Oh my goodness. >> Oh, you have costs. I haven't seen that. There you go. >> They have a aside from the usage now you have an because I was every single CLI actually has a really nice summary. Gemini CLI. >> But how come that how come that was so Wait a minute. How come this I guess it doesn't have the my previous run does it? >> Probably not. No, this is probably your cost from this shell session. Even if you restore a previous >> See, this is why I don't want my commands to be polluted. That's the first time I just noticed this stuff. >> Yeah, you beats and the the same second you see the command that you needed. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Okay, so plugins pros and cons. Um same with MCPS, right? But but we were just talking about agents and and I was about to like share with you my experience. You you also don't know what's the difference between skills and agents. >> So basically agents actually are part of your shell. They come come with it no matter if you build them or not. >> Okay. So what's what agents are there already then? Are you you suggesting that >> the planning agents the explore agents? If you go into agents without building any uh slash agents, you will see that builtin there's two agents at least. Yeah. And I think they're adding more. >> No, no. Well, >> oh, built in. Okay. Sorry. [ __ ] I [snorts] just killed the share. >> Let me let me share my whole screen. Hopefully I don't share anything insane. >> Um, yeah. So in agents, I've got my GitHub CLI agent there. And then then it's built >> in agents general purpose status line setup. >> I ran that one. >> Oh, okay. Okay. And then it sets up the status line. Okay. What is it? That status line is kind of like by default it agents copies your bash shell status and then it shows your bash shell status line at the bottom. Uh I think you just >> Oh, I supposed to >> Yeah. >> run. >> I think after a while would have come back and and tried to run it. >> You're auto compact. I have set that off. [snorts] >> Yeah, that's >> okay. So that's what did I just run there? you wanted to do status line but let not do that. Um so basically some agents are in there the explore agent from uses haiku to quickly go through all of the paths and make a summary of what's inside your repository. Um…\n\n[slide:5] [36:10–46:53]\none of these like for example this one was generated by Gemini which uh in the overview we can see it's just like oh add this um Golang packet library to to automatically infer this the JSON schema from JSON data sample >> uh add this into a new infer service into internal. It doesn't even say like it's part of the grid API because this repository has many different things. So, so this is absolutely disgusting. If I want to give this to Haiku, it's going to completely it's going to go bonkers and and completely mess up my code, right? Um, >> so this is one of created and then this I show you the other one now created by um by like this one for example is created by Son. Oh no, this one is >> you need you need to you need to add a label that is created by um No. >> Gemini or so many or um where is it? >> Yeah. Can you can you alter your integration skill? >> Make sure you label which which model put this thing in. >> That's actually not a bad idea because there's the author part here and I can see sometimes cloud puts itself as the assigne and that actually keeps it like nice to see. Um but integrate inference into state upload update proto definitions update goal schema is that okay this is so in the video I sent you I cut out all of the me searching which one was created by which model uh and it's really neat like the difference but here you can see the difference right this is how I want an issue to look like which is update the go SDK schema uh source field um so that it lives here right um this is the description then this is another flag that beat says to design right this is the changes you need to make there's some notes um which hasn't had any notes and then there's the acceptance criteria output key um is like this this is the the final result and this is kind of like what I want like the big planner model opus generates this type of design and then I want to give it to like a very fast and dumb model and if they are not if they are not going outside and too creative then hiku normally would end up with exactly to the spec and then I would be able to like everything would perfectly Cool. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That's a really good optimization. So, just to replay my understanding, you you get Opus to plan everything, put everything in beads as as task and then you then you spin out haiku agents to implement it. >> Yeah. So, beads beats allows models to focus on the tasks and then you can kill a session and you can just spin up a new…\n\n[slide:6] [46:33–52:34]\naround those outputs so it will it will store a JSON schema so if you're building some other infrastructure somewhere else you can pull down that JSON schema from the other state and you can code against that because that's what you can expect that the outputs will look like and and it will also change right if if the if the output schema changes it will it will flag it it will say like yeah the values change you need to replan but not only that the schema changed so you may may have like complete breakage when you consume these outputs right so so it's a quite a big features with a lot of um capabilities in there so the initial thing that I asked while I was in in uh watching F1 I asked chat GPT like I've got this API um I want to do like I want people to be able to register the shape of those outputs. Um, my primary library is in Typescript and they have these definition files and TypeScript is a great language to defining schemas. Um, however, not everyone is using TypeScript. Um, and it would be annoying that you have to define a TypeScript interface. Um, although I like the the way of writing TypeScript is way more nicer than than defining JSON schema in my opinion. Uh, but I thought maybe to keep it simple, TypeScript can easily go to JSON schema. uh maybe there's some fidelity loss and not exactly the same but you can go between them. So I thought like JSON schema seems like the best option to go across languages cuz then you can have JSON schema supporting everything Python um and everything. So a little bit a little back and forth between me and open eye which is really more like a rubber duck at that point right he just says yeah sure go with Jason >> great you are great [laughter] >> absolutely also shadow conspiracy anyway um so so so that was the first step right uh identifying how uh like what how do we capture the schema um and this this whole inference thing wasn't a thing I was just like I want to give people the ability to just post like an endpoint to post what the output shape will be like and and then we can look at like validating it right so but there's I was thinking to myself this is so complicated for 100% there's 100 like edge cases and scenarios that I'm not taking into account but I think that's what's great about Sonet um and this is one of the things that I shared in a video with you as well is that I ask son to do these…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "Two software developers discuss the rapid evolution of AI coding tools, focusing on the shift toward Anthropic's Claude models and the practical application of automated agents in infrastructure engineering. They analyze recent benchmarks from prominent tech influencers and share personal workflows involving specialized IDEs, task management systems like Beads, and the orchestration of multiple AI models to handle complex refactoring and planning.\n\n[slide:1]\n## Theo's Shift to Anthropic\nThe conversation begins with the observation that Theo (T3), previously seen as a staunch OpenAI advocate, has publicly declared Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 as his new favorite model. Theo highlighted a massive boost in UI generation capabilities, which was previously a weak point for Anthropic's models. He utilizes a \"snitchbench\" repository for benchmarking and relies on the Cursor IDE, though he noted that git work trees are currently broken in that environment. The developers discuss the utility of git work trees for spinning off parallel implementations of the same specification to test different technologies or architectural patterns. This workflow allows an engineer to define a specification and then have the AI implement it in five different ways to compare results. The speakers also mention that Theo's shift is significant because he previously received early access to OpenAI models but is now benchmarking Anthropic models on the same timeline as other creators.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Model Consistency and Access\nThe developers compare \"output ceiling\"—the best possible result a model can achieve—against consistency. While models like GPT 5.1 Pro or Gemini 3 might occasionally hit higher peaks, Opus and Sonnet are praised for their reliable and consistent output across repeated prompts. Accessing Google's Gemini 3 remains a point of frustration due to fragmented subscription plans across Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Google Cloud Code Assist. One speaker describes the \"anti-gravity\" IDE as a rebranded version of Windsurf, noting the industry drama where Google reportedly poached the Windsurf CEO while leaving the original team and intellectual property behind. This has led to a \"nerfed\" experience for some users where the model is frequently overloaded or unavailable. The speakers also discuss the pricing strategy of Anthropic, noting they slashed the price of Opus to make it more competitive with Sonnet 4.5 after the release of Gemini.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Automating Workflows with Agents\nOne developer shares a success story using a custom GitHub CLI agent to manage Dependabot pull requests across 300 repositories. Using the Haiku model for speed and cost-efficiency, the agent launched 50 parallel processes to look at issues and merge PRs. Mid-way through the task, the agent autonomously decided to create a shell script to process the remaining repositories more efficiently without being explicitly instructed to do so. This behavior mimics human problem-solving, where a developer identifies a repetitive pattern and automates it. The speaker notes that while the process encountered some conflicts, it was generally safe and significantly faster than manual intervention.\n*I didn't even tell it to do that... it's kind of like what it did.*\n\n[slide:4]\n## Agents Versus Skills\nThe discussion clarifies the distinction between agents and skills within the Cloud Code environment. Agents are built-in components of the shell, such as the \"explore\" agent that uses Haiku to summarize repository structures or the \"planning\" agent that generates implementation steps. Skills are specialized capabilities or templates that can be assigned to models. The speakers mention Beads, a CLI-focused tool designed for agents to manage tasks without the overhead of a complex UI. They also discuss the \"auto-compact\" feature in Opus 4.5, which manages context windows more efficiently by progressively searching and exposing only relevant tools to the model. One developer expresses frustration with \"polluted\" command spaces where too many plugins or Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools make it difficult to find the necessary commands.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Comparing Task Generation Quality\nA direct comparison between Gemini 3 and Sonnet 3.5 reveals significant differences in task quality when using the Beads task management system. Gemini produced poor, one-line descriptions that lacked the necessary context for implementation, such as failing to specify which service or API a change belonged to. In contrast, Sonnet generated detailed issues including design notes, file paths, and specific acceptance criteria. The discrepancy was traced back to a specific \"skill\" template in the user's home directory that Sonnet was configured to follow, while Gemini followed the prompt more literally without the benefit of that background context. The developers conclude that using a high-level \"planner\" model like Opus to generate detailed specs, which are then executed by a faster model like Haiku, is the most efficient optimization for complex features.\n*This is kind of like what I want... the big planner model opus generates this type of design.*\n\n[slide:6]\n## AI Productivity and Real-World Use\nThe developers discuss the \"human aspect\" of AI adoption, referencing findings that AI usage is a skill that rewards confidence and frequent practice. They explore the idea of \"trust but verify,\" where the developer focuses on orchestration and high-level review rather than line-by-line coding. One speaker describes a workflow where he used Claude on his mobile phone to spec out a Terraform state management feature while watching a race, then seamlessly integrated those ideas into his desktop environment using SpecKit and Beads. They also discuss the importance of \"scoping down\" AI models, as they often suggest overly complex solutions for simple MVP requirements. By using a second model to review the first model's plan, developers can identify \"actionable error messages\" or other requirements that add unnecessary complexity to a project. The conversation ends with a reflection on how AI is shifting the role of the software engineer toward that of a staff engineer or orchestrator."
