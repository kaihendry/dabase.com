    "content": "Transcript:\nWelcome to episode 12 of the AI\nInfrastructure Podcast with me, Kai\nHendry in the UK and Vincent Smith over\nin Vietnam. In this episode, we talk\nabout CDKTF.\nAnd long story short, we try to\nrationalize where CDKTF fits in in light\nof the recent deprecation by Hashi Corp/\nIBM.\nAnd\nwe we do justify CDK. Uh well, let me\ngive you a summary why we think CDK is\nimportant.\nIt's a high level abstraction\nand it allows complicated cloud\ninfrastructure to be reasoned about.\nIt allows you to get the most out of the\ncloud to differentiate.\nAnd if you just think conversely perhaps\nif you got if you vibe coded your\ninfrastructure using I don't know AWS\nCLI or something you just couldn't get\nuh\na solid reproducible deterministic\ninfrastructure that way you need higher\nlevel constructs uh that the AWS CDK\nsort of provide you. So\nyou ideally need to work with it. So in\nlight of the deprecation of of IBM that\nwe need to find a place for for CDK a\nprogramming language in order to do the\nnext level stuff with the cloud and\ninfrastructure. So enjoy the episode.\nPlease uh\nif if CDKTF doesn't uh tickle your\nfancy, check out the other stuff in the\nplaylist and have a merry Christmas. See\nyou. Goodbye.\nYeah, this guy. Which which guy?\n>> So, since CDKTF was sunset by IBM and I\ncreated a fork under a project that I\nbuilt a bunch of CDKF\nL2 constructs. There's one guy who's\nbeen contributing three PRs over\nwell so far he's contributed I think\nseven PRs already and I merged six and\nhe keeps adding cool stuff. It's\namazing.\n>> Yeah. So you just forked it and and\n>> No, no, no. He contributes.\n[clears throat]\nSo the one that I forked, I put it on\npause, right? We're waiting for a go-\nahead. Um we're collaborating with the\nOpen Construct Foundation which um hosts\nseveral of the\nyou know CDK related projects and we're\ntrying to find a final and good name. Um\nhopefully we don't have to rename but I\nsincere I seriously doubt that Hashi\nCorp is going to allow us to use the\noriginal CDKTF package names. So we'll\nprobably have to rename it. And I\nrenamed the TCON which is Terra\nConstructs. It's a four-letter acronym\nand people obviously don't like that.\nTCON sounds familiar now. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Terra Constructs is the library\nthat I built.\n>> Oh okay.\n>> Yeah. So tons is is what I you know it's\na scope that I have on npmgs. So I use\nit for a lot of stuff. So I was like,\n\"Yeah, I'm just going to reuse I just\ntook immediate action, right? Fork it\nand rename it to my stuff and then\n[snorts]\n>> then um\n>> yeah, so it it pushed my project in the\nforeground and we're holding on the fork\nbecause we don't have the final name and\nI agree maybe we don't call it TCON, but\nat the same time somebody else took\nnotice of my other project and has\ncontributed about eight PRs to it and\nthey are all high quality.\n>> Can you show me? Can you get give me a\nlink? I just I'm just curious to see\nwhat what what what you what what this\ncontribution is. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Uh\nit's on my\nhere.\nI have to get used to this um thing\njumping around. Hold on.\n>> But you mean your Arch Linux C?\n>> Yeah, I use I use Arch by the way.\nIt's never going to get old. Going to\nkeep saying it. Okay. I send it on Zoom.\n>> Yeah. Like Primagin says a lot. Does he?\n>> Does he just We're just following other\nYouTubers. So sad.\n[snorts] Uh\n>> no. But then then I have to start\nwhining like Teo.\n>> Shots fired.\n>> I'm already doing a job whining. Right.\nOne complaint that I get from my YouTube\nchannel is that like, Kai, yeah, I like\nyour content, but you you you complain\ntoo much, so I can't watch you. It's\nlike, what do I am I that guy?\nUh,\nokay. Refactor, use AWS CDK. Oh, hold\non. Let me see if I can sh my screen.\nI've been digging into that PR because\nit actually enables really cool stuff.\nSo basically a little bit of background.\nAWS CDK has this regional information\nlibrary\nthat keeps it track of like which\ncapabilities are available across the\nregions. They download a fact table like\nuh lambda runtime support for NodeJS\nlatest is version 22 in China or\ngovernment region for example but it's\nversion 24 for other regions where\nNodeJS version 24 has already been\ndeployed right it takes time for this\nstuff to deploy\n>> so [clears throat]\nother stuff is like uh S3 bucket\nendpoints or like the domain suffix of\nan S3 uh original endpoint point, right?\nThe URL suffix that um they changed the\nway that that S3 works over the years.\nSo new regions, they use a different\nsuffix.\n>> So the you know, I think I noticed that.\n>> Yeah. So the AWS CDK has logic in it\nthat uses a fact table about the regions\nto figure out how to build a a bucket or\nlike if you give it a a bucket URL or\njust a bucket name and and it's it has a\nit has a regional like your AWS CDK\nstack has a region. So then it uses that\ninformation to find out yeah what's\ngoing to be the domain URL for that\nbucket depending on the region. So I had\ncopied that over. I had copied over the\nfact table into my code because I didn't\nknow it was a separate package. And he\nsays, \"Well, you know, we don't have to\ncopy over the details. We can just reuse\nthe AWS CDK package on top of CDKTF.\"\n>> Cool. This actually looks like a pretty\ngood contribution. Holy moly. I'm I'm\n>> Oh yeah, dude. All of his contributions\nhave been absolute fire. The only thing\nis he doesn't write integration tests.\nSo every single one of them I I check\nout and I um I I build an integration\ntest and I validate that you can\nactually terraform deploy it into AWS\nand doesn't get any errors. Yeah. But\nhe's been he's been aligning Terra\nconstructs closely to AWS CDK.\n>> Cool.\nSo I got a couple of maybe noob\nquestions for you but like I guess this\nmight serve the audience.\nSo\nCDK for Terraform\nbasically allow people to write in that\nfamiliar CDK style which was\nwhich was like which came out of\n>> AWS\n>> AWS uh what's his name? Ben Ben Israel\nright that guy\n>> not Ben Israel\n>> um who was it again?\nIs it worth mentioning her name?\nWho? What? Sorry.\n>> Who who who was the guy that was in the\noriginal team that he left and he he did\ndid Wing Wing Lang?\n>> Yeah. Elot Ben Israel. Uh Elot Ben\nIsrael.\n>> Oh, I I wasn't wrong with the name.\nOkay. Sorry.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> I thought I was making up the his name\nor something. So, CDK\ncool beans. I think we went through\nyesterday that it was like the the thing\nthat really makes it different is that\nis that it's operationally\nuh friendly. You can refactor this the\nstuff\nand it's a programming language un\nunlike maybe Terraform and things like\nthat. Now the thing that I don't\nunderstand is how it links up with\nTerraform. A and B\nwhat did actually CDK for Terraform\nactually provide? Did they provide\neverything that that uh Terraform\nproviders did or was it a subset?\nOkay. So\nthe cloud development toolkit CDK from\nAWS com is built upon and they've split\nthis out like some composible\num ideas. So one of them is the concept\nof constructs. Constructs are basically\nobjects that\nknow how to synthesize or write themsel\nout into like a small little snippet of\nconfiguration,\n>> right? If you use if you use a con and\nthey are able to be composed into trees\nof constructs so you can nest constructs\ninto other constructs and so\n>> yeah don't people sometimes call them\n>> oh is my webcam just stopped don't don't\nsome people call them like stages or\nsomething like that\n>> no stages is something else I think it's\num if you are doing like cloud for\ndeployment across different\nenvironments. I think you can define\nstages,\n>> okay,\n>> to like duplicate stacks. I I mean I I\nknow that CDK pipelines uses stages. I\nknow that there's a concept of stages\nwithin AWS CDK, but the thing is\nfirst AWS CDK was built within AWS.\nRight.\n>> Right.\n>> They had a couple of crucial innovations\nin terms of infrastructure as code. The\nfirst one is a tree,\na composition of configuration that\nstarts at the root note which is usually\nyour app, your entry point and from\nthere on you tie like a tree of\nconstructs and when you and each one of\nthem have a little bit of configuration\nlike information so they know how to\nsynthesize out into a configuration\ntarget language. So if you use AWS CDK,\nthe constructs that you need are the\napp, the AWS CDK app,\n>> that synthesizes itself down to a cloud\nfor stack,\n>> right?\n>> And then each construct that you put\ninside those apps\num will be a cloud for resource, right?\nBecause within a stack you use cloud\nform resources, right?\n>> Right.\n>> And now if you apply those ideas on top\nof Terraform,\n>> right? So when when they port over the\nthe app, it's basically something that\nrepresents a single terraform\nuh root module, right? If you talk about\nterraform modu um nomenclature or or\nconcepts\n>> terminologies.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. If you if you basically have\na directory and you drop in a config\nfile and then you run Terraform in it,\nit will consider that directory as the\nroot module, right? And then if you\ncreate another directory and you put in\nsome config there and then you include\nthat directory as a module that will be\nlike a sub module right. So in terapform\nconstructs are kind of like directories\nof configuration files and you you um\nsource them into like module source and\nthen you can nest those modules as well.\nBut the one that is the actual um\nyou know app entry point is the root\nmodule of your directory. Right? When\nterraform runs, it will find the\nterapform configurations in your\ndirectly sibling files and aggregate\neverything into a single config in\nmemory, right? Both HCL, which is a\nseparate set of JSON and some JSON if\nyou want. And then it will create in\nmemory your Terraform configuration.\nAnd then within that root module, you\nmay refer to other modules that are\ncoming from either\n>> it does it write it out as normal\nTerraform. So you can inspect the\nTerraform.\n>> Yeah. So the the whole greatness of CDK\nfor Terraform is that ultimately what\nyou get once you synthesize or serialize\nthat construct tree down to the target\nlanguage you get pure and raw Terraform\n>> and is is it is it readable or is it\nlike\n>> it is\n>> nonsense?\n>> It's very readable. Uh there's a couple\nof things that may you know make people\nupset because in the construct tree\num the identity of a resource like if\nyou write terraform you're going to say\num AWS\ninstance and then you give it a name\nlike uh web and then you put in the\nconfig attributes such as VPC ID\ninstance type imi like what's the image\nthat needs to be provided right so the\nname right AWS instance And then you\nhave the name web in when you serialize\nfrom from TypeScript down into that\nconfig.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Kind of flattens everything. So it it\ndoes some type of unique ID generation.\n>> That's a good thing though. I thought we\nwe we discussed that.\n>> No, it it's it creates an unique logical\nID. So that resource it's not your\nphysical ID because in in any case when\nyou create an instance in AWS your\nphysical ID is you cannot determine it\neither, right? Not all AWS resources\nallow you to determine your physical ID.\nThe instance ID is I- blah blah blah\nblah. Your your load balancer ID is I is\nLB- something. But if you do a bucket\nand you say I want the bucket name to be\nFU, it will be exactly FU and globally\nunique. You will not get it even if\nsomebody else created a bucket fu.\nRight? [snorts]\n>> Um so so some resources they allow you\nto determine or to define your physical\nID and some [snorts] resources they\ndon't allow you and they automatically\nget an ID. But here I'm talking about\nthe logical ID, right? Even though the\nlogical ID will be something that you\nwrite in your configuration file. So if\nyou ask me like does it serialize to to\nreadable terraform, it is just the logic\nids have these weird suffixes that you\ncan actually disable if you want. You\ncan actually go and say don't give me\nthese hash suffixes, but they're used to\nmake things unique. They're used to make\nsure that the logic IDs don't have any\nconflicts. So, [snorts] so that's the\nonly thing that I think people when they\nfirst look at it kind of get annoyed by\nis like why are these names so like have\nthis weird checksum like like you know\nthis hash at the end of the name. Uh and\nthat's purely because they don't want to\nhave a conflict or an error when you\nhave like nested parts that all get\nserialized down into the root module.\n>> Um so CDKTF also supports modules\nTerraform modules by the way you can\nrefer to an existing Terapform module.\nSo it's very good for an existing team\nthat is already using terapform modules\nextensively. With CDKTF, you can take\nthat terapform module and convert it\ninto a TypeScript interface. So it reads\nthe full module definition, looks at all\nof the variables and their types\n>> and then creates an equivalent type.\n>> In my in my current client, we we we\nswitched to Terra. They they were\nthey're a CDK shop, but we but when I\njoined, we we basically set up a new\nworkflow with Terraform because of\nSnowflake.\nBut it sounds like I could have used\nCDKTF to bring in the Snowflake\nTerraform provider into into CDK world,\nright? Or to Am I misunderstanding?\nthe CDKTF provider would allow you to if\nyou so so that's one thing right you can\ncreate bindings for modules and it will\nlook at the variables that the module\ntake and then generate a typescript\ninterface or you can create bindings to\nterapform providers like the so\nsnowflake provider and yes you will get\na TypeScript interface but no it will\nnot allow you to to use it with AWS CDK\nright because AWS CDK only works with\ncloud form and the CDKTF generated one\nwill generate terraform.\n>> Yeah. Yes. So, but it Yeah.\nI mean, to be honest, I'm not a huge fan\nof all the I mean, this this this magic\nconverting different bindings of\ndifferent languages into CDK kind of\nmakes me nervous.\n>> I I want to clarify one thing, right? in\nitself\ncreating a terapform provider I mean\nreading in the terraform provider\nresources and generating TypeScript\nbindings or Python orn net or whatever\non its own has very little value\nhonestly um you just get these like L1\nconstructs and you now can call that\nconstructor and maybe the one thing that\nyou get is you're able to use like um\nlazy evaluations basically you And for\nsome attributes, you can provide a\nfunction instead of an actual value. And\nso when it synthesizes, it's going to\nexecute the function to basically decide\nwhat the value for that property needs\nto be. And that is very powerful\nalready, right? Because it means that\ndepending on how you call it, a function\ncan execute and then determine what the\nvalue for this particular attribute\ncould be. Um, for example, if you are\nwhere is this like really useful? Yeah,\nmaybe in policies, right? Let's say that\nyou you are you are building some type\nof infrastructure and you're using an IM\npolicy and you're using a bunch of other\nresources and you want the policy to be\ngenerated at the very end after the user\nhas already defined the full program and\nall of the configuration that he wants\nto be\n>> generated. Yeah, there's a lease\nprivileges type thing. M\n>> yeah the functions can be very smart and\nidentify exactly what are the actions\nthat need to be added into the policy\ndepending on what the user um you know\nconnected. So it's kind of like it's\nkind of a mixture of like an imperative\nlanguage to create a declarative\ndefinition of infrastructure as code and\nlike people are like oh you know why\nwould you do that you know is all about\ndeclarative and you you cannot do mix it\nwith imperative you start doing that\npeople will no longer like know exactly\nwhat's going on uh but if you look at\nthe language itself since uh terraform\n0.12\nyou know before it became uh stable they\nadded um list comprehensions they added\ndynamic values dynamic you know for each\nand there's a very clear reason why they\ndid that because you can't manage AWS\nresources with pure static definitions\nyou're always before that you have free\nprocessors people wrote template\nlanguages to generate terapform\nconfiguration\n>> yeah yeah I feel I feel this is a trend\nin infrastructures co in infrastructure\ngame is like\nthe days have gone where you can just\ndeclaratively put thing is in YAML,\nright? You you need\n>> you need a programming language and then\n>> you're going to keep adding layers and\nlayers of abstraction to work around\nthis this core missing feature that you\nare not working with a proper language\nprogramming language and then you start\nadding um config language.\n>> Yeah. So generators\n>> I guess in a in a very\nuh succinct way CDK gives you the binds\nto a proper programming language and\nthat's that's really what what it does\nright [clears throat]\n>> and but still I mean and then and then\nit gives you the ability to do lazy\nevaluations so late binding um so that\nyou can evaluate the full full program\nand the user can program uh imperatively\nbuild up the the configuration so he can\ntake some object that somebody else\nwrote and then invoke some methods on it\nto mutate this, you know, the the the\nobject to their liking.\n>> Like for example, in in CDK for\nKubernetes, um when you create a\ndeployment, it's going to define a pot\ntemplate and then a replica uh count\nthat how many times you want that\ntemplate to be created um to create the\npots, right? And and then you want maybe\nto set some type of anti-affffinity. So\nyou can do all of that declaratively in\nin Kubernetes and it's not a simple\nconfiguration system because to define a\npot template with anti- affinity rules\num to be fully flexible and this is also\nwhy people like compose right compose is\nsuper simple but like Kubernetes has all\nthe little dials and knobs.\n>> Sorry what's compose oh with a K. You\nmean\n>> docker compose um you know before that\nor ECS people like\n>> oh docker compose oh okay\n>> yeah I love docker compose because it\ngives you like this very simple thing\nbut if you want to do something earlier\nyou were complaining um yesterday you\nwere complaining you were saying\nverscell is great but if you want to do\nlike um custom type of database I can't\ndo it you know I need the dials and\nknobs well that's where it breaks right\nthese abstractions so the same way way\nwith compose and and and that's why\nkubernetes as like everything under the\nsun, right? You can define exactly what\nresources on the node need to be\n>> for days and crossplane.\n>> Yes. And and and and so the actual\nconfiguration you have to write becomes\nsuper complicated. Kubernetes is the\nsame thing. You end up with like\n>> what is the Yeah. So I got CDK is the\nprogramming language answer to maybe uh\nTerraform. But what is what is the\nprogramming language answer to to\nyou know Kubernetes?\nSo AWS built CDK for Kubernetes. There's\none guy Ilia, he did a lot of like he's\none of the main contributors.\nYeah, I loved it. Like initially it was\na bit frustrating because you\n>> Yeah, because one of the things you\nlearn as a Kubernetes administrator and\nif you go for certificates, which I\nnever do because I don't think they're\nworth it. Um,\n>> oh dear God, don't go there. That's a\nrabbit hole.\n>> Yeah. So\n>> is this another Ben Israel thing? Um,\nno, but it comes from within AWS, but it\napplies the same idea of of creating a\ntree of constructs and and and the same\nidea of building like the core\nKubernetes API objects which are pod\ndeployment, replica set, um, service and\nall of these, right? And now he's doing\nrobotics.\n>> Anyway, so Ilia is one of the guys that\nlike I see contribute and react and\nstill maintain this project mostly. I'm\nsure there's other people working on it.\nBut the greatest thing here is\n>> the moment you have built those core API\nobjects, you can still write this, you\nknow, create your Kubernetes\nconfiguration, but it's honestly worse\nworse than YAML because you have all\nthese additional curly braces and very\nnested like complicated configuration.\nSo pure L1 constructs, this pure\nlanguage binding are not very useful.\nBut what's immensely useful when you\nwork with CDK for Kubernetes is that\nthey built these higher level ideas of\nlike we're going to grab this low-level\nAPI object that's called a deployment\nand we're going to add a scheduling\nnamespace and we're going to add the\nidea of spreading pods on the scheduling\nnamespace and suddenly you are defining\nlike I want to spread this across nodes\nand there you basically you go like my\ndeployment.spread spread dot uh sorry my\ndeployment.sccheduling.spread\nspread as a method. Your intention is to\nspread these pots. That's your\nintention, right? And that gets\ntranslated into a declaration, an actual\nrule.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> the affinity\n>> these convenient Yeah, that sounds like\na good useful abstraction.\n>> Plus,\n>> so what what abstractions?\n>> Oh, plus, sorry. Yeah, plus is is the\nthe the the real power because that's\nwhere they they create these high level\nlike deployment and chron job and and\nthen you and they make service and and\nthen they have like reasonable defaults.\nSo with very few lines of code it's kind\nof like Helm, right? But Helm is\ndeclarative like YAML config files with\nno schema. So you don't get\nIntelliSense. you don't know exactly\nlike where do I need to put this\nconfiguration for it to end up where it\nneeds to be because YAML helm doesn't\nhave any schemas and even in later\nversions they try to add schemas but it\ndoesn't really work.\n>> So have you have you used this\nproduction or you just checked it out?\n>> No I I I I\nwas at an organization that had\neverything under the sun. They had helm\nthey had JSONet they had customized they\nhad\n>> Oh my god.\n>> Yeah. They had everything.\n>> And did you introduce something new\nwhile you were there? Of course, I I I\nbuilt a new standard, but I [laughter]\ndid more than that. I did not just add a\nnew standard. I actually built a bunch\nof migration tools for everything else.\nSo, I I had like a very clear path like\nif this is a service that you're working\non and we we were adopting Argo CD and\nthe only way to adopt Argo CD was to\nadopt CDK for Kubernetes. So, I made it\nso that you can't go and manage your\nservice with Argo CD without\n>> I don't think we've ever really talked\nabout GitOps. Are you a GitOps? I mean,\ndo you have uh any opinions there\nquickly?\n>> Yes, I I\n>> maybe save that for another video.\nI [snorts] ran Argo CD since 2019\nand very quickly realized that a lot of\npeople like to do magic on the server\nside and they like to minimize the\nconfiguration that goes in and then they\nlike to Argo CD to like expand\neverything using Helm uh rendering like\nlast minute.\n>> Oh no no no. You want Argo CD just to be\na UI is is or\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You want Argo CD to\ntake whatever is in git and fire it\nstraight at Kubernetes. Exactly. And\nthen get back to that's that's one thing\nI I use Argo CD and ang\n>> crazy like why mix it up.\n>> Yeah. So some so they build all these\namazing customized plugins and Helm\nplugins to run on the Argo City server\nand that's the first thing I throw out\nbecause you want\n>> you and I\npattern\n>> sorry\n>> you and I are the are a little bit too\nsimilar\n>> but but you know why this is relevant\nbecause this is called the rendered\nmanifest pattern and the co and the core\ncreator of Kubernetes like one of the\nco-founders Brian Grant and one of the\nco-founder founders of of of the idea of\ngithops uh for flux with weave and you\nknow there's flux cd and there's argo cd\n>> yeah I don't yeah flux used to be a\ncontender right\n>> I think ar flux is still a contender\nthey broke it down into microser they\nmake it it's way more performant but it\ndoesn't have a fancy UI so everyone\nloves Argo CD but nobody like flux is\nstill evolving but again like I haven't\nran communities for 2 years but what I\nwanted to say is that the guys that are\nvery, you know, smart people, [laughter]\nBrian Grant and um Richardson, uh from\nWeave, they created the logical\nextension of this rendered manifest\npattern. So basically the idea of like\nyou you make sure that everything gets\nrendered down into manifest into git. So\nArgo CD can purely track a raw manifest\nand just fire it off after Kubernetes\nand then you you are able to validate\nimmediately what is the error message\nthat that Kubernetes sends back because\nit just relates directly to whatever you\nhave in git. So you can see very\nclearly. So they evolved that pattern\nand they call it config hub. So instead\nof just like having a very dumb git\ndatabase, they built a specialized\ndatabase for for for uh storing these\nconfigurations. And then the idea of\nlike um making a change, you can go\nstraight into config hub and make a a\nchange where it needs to be. So you\ndon't need to go through the git\npipeline. Um and then you can also call\nfunctions if you need to make a change\nacross\n>> I thought we thought I thought we\nestablished that changing things outside\nthe the pipeline is a bad idea.\nSo, so they turned it upside down and\nthey they provided an a config hub that\nhelps you make changes in a controlled\nway and in a repeatable way because it's\nkind of like functional programming. You\ncan register endpoints on top of your\nconfig data and then you can apply\nfunctions. So, mutate your config data\nacross your whole environment and then\nyou can do it with an approval step uh\nworkflow. So you you just select what\nyou want to affect, you apply the\nfunction, you can see a preview, and\nthen you can approve and then boom, it's\nGitOps. It gets ops in a in a in a like\nreasonable way.\n>> Have you used this product? Have you\nused this yourself?\n>> Uh no, but I um I understand the idea\nbecause a lot of what what he built\noriginally with customize, you know, the\nidea of applying JSON patches, they kind\nof like extended it as those get JSON\npatches now run as part of like ant\nhooks. haven't used it. They just made\nit like\n>> Oh, yeah. We were talking about hooks\nyesterday. What was using hooks again?\nOh my god.\n>> Oh, can do can do\n>> Yeah. Yeah. The hooks thing is\n>> in the CDK as well.\n>> This kind of a little bit different.\nHooks.\n>> Yeah. But this one in my mind\n>> I don't know if config hub can can\nmanage any other configuration except\nfor Kubernetes. This this is like firmly\nsettled in the idea of like a\nreconciliation loop and and having a\ncontrol plane that runs that constantly\nruns these reconciliation loops and\nautomatically adjust your like with\neventual consistency adjust your your\ncloud towards it. Right?\n>> So which is one thing that Terraform\ndoes not have right terraform you run an\napply and it doesn't touch it until the\nnext time you run an apply where\nKubernetes is constantly re-evaluating\nyour infrastructure and making sure that\nit is aligned. I the the one thing\nuh\n[snorts]\nwas so like let me start with the\nproblem at what we're using terraform\nuh actually this is a problem with CDK\ntoo the whole CDK deploy thing is a bit\nslow but okay never mind that\n>> that's cloudformation issues\n>> that's that's infrastructures yeah\nthat's that's cloudformation issues but\num stop me if I talked about this before\nbut one one issue that we have right now\nis that we're using uh database we're\nusing Terraform to to manage Snowflake\nand we don't want to we don't want to\ndelete the resources because that could\nlead to data loss and all\n>> stuff and we don't want to recreate\nresources. So, so I have I have like\nsome crappy\n>> worried about constantly re like\n>> Yeah, I have some crappy what do you\ncall it? You know, uh GitHub workflow\nwhere I basically inspect the plan to\nmake sure to make sure it's not deleting\nanything. But I thought to myself, come\non, there's got to be a better way\nbecause because right now we have a we\nhave a separate plan and an apply stage.\nWhy? Because we want people to do a plan\nbefore they know what they're doing\nbefore they delete things.\nUnfortunately, no one really reads the\nplan in all honesty. So, there's that\nproblem. So, so hence I have some crappy\ncode to check for for some a deletion or\na a recreate. And I just think to\nmyself, is this the way people do it? Is\nthere a better way?\nI mean, that that sort of life cycle\ntype thing kind of sucks.\nThat's my current.\n>> Yeah. And that's also why a lot of\npeople when we talk about crossplane\nthere people very um\npessimistic around it because they put\nso much um official or orchestration\naround this you know plan and apply.\nthey have a a big like ceremony around\nthe process and so something going\nbehind the scene and constantly\nreconciling kind of feels wrong to them,\nright? Uh and I think it really depends\non the maturity. If you're Google and\nyou're deploying a thousand times a day,\nyour services are reconciling and this\nis how you build your architecture. I\nguess if you I guess the there's an\nthere's an adage with when it comes to I\nmean this is probably one of the first\nthings I learned when I got into\ninfrastructure is like don't manage your\ndatabase in infrastructure is code\nyou know because because then you won't\nhave these problems like separate the\ndata\n>> so that was definitely s uh like true\nfor the longest time because stateful\nkubernetes cluster\n>> like\nmaintaining database in and I think\nthere was a Kubernetes uh controller or\nsomething where you could spin up a a\ndatabase and everyone said no this is a\nterrible idea\n>> and I and quickly caught on to why\n>> if I talk about 2016 then stateful sets\nare like just introduced.\n>> Yeah.\nAnd and so at the time the problem with\nHelm is that everyone can just pull a\nchart and go like, \"Oh, uh, Helm\ninstalled MySQL. There I go. I have\nMySQL now.\" Yes. But you know,\n>> set up a huge cluster.\n>> Yeah. What what where where is the data\nstores? Oh, so it's provisioning an EBS\nvolume. How how is the ownership of that\nEBS volume tracked? Like what if you do\nan upgrade? How do you manage? And then\npeople they built this is like you know\npets versus cattle where you're building\nyes you're creating a a cattle of nodes\nbut you're building pat kubernetes\nclusters. So so what is the the point of\npat kubernetes clusters then you need to\nstart bu using arcane or whatever it's\ncalled to to create backups of your\nclusters and your control plane. I never\nlike that idea. I always made my cluster\ncompletely stateless so that I can\nrebuild it\n>> a thermal I don't know.\n>> Yeah. So all of all of the state lives\noutside right that's how you want to\nbuild your microservices if you can\ndepending on you know what is the SLAs\nand and what is your your architecture\nthat you have to support um but if you\ncan and you can perfectly scale\nhorizontally and you keep all of your\ndata on a different tier outside of your\ncluster then that makes life so much\neasier because you can just blow away a\ncluster and rebuild it. Yeah.\n>> You can just put them side by side and\nthey can share the state outside of the\ncluster. Um and then once you start\nbuilding stateful clusters, your SLOs's\nare completely different. Your your\noperations around those clusters are\ncompletely different.\n>> Yeah. But but don't you think that like\nlike just going going back to CDK like I\nmean a lot of tooling does bring state\ninto it, doesn't it? A little bit.\nSorry about CDK and and like uh sorry to\nI'm just trying to bring it back to\nto CDK like like like doesn't CDK I\nthink we talked about it yesterday but\nlike doesn't CDK have like a strong\nconcept of context or something like\nthat and that in itself is a state isn't\nit I mean\nso on one side in these traditional\ninfrastructure as code frameworks you\nhave the concept of a state like cloud\nform keeps track of the resources it\ncreated And Terraform has a state file\nthat keeps track of the resources it\ncreated. So that it knows, you know, it\nties back those logical ids in the state\nfile to the actual physical ideas. And\nif you remove a logic ID in your\nconfiguration, it will make sure that\nthat resource is deleted. And if you\nmodify the configuration,\n>> yeah,\n>> it will make sure that the actual\nphysical ID uh resource is updated.\nRight. So\n>> it uses a state file.\n>> Yeah. So basically I'm just\nuh wiring these in my brain. I mean I'm\ncrosswiring these in my brain. Like if\nwe have infrastructure and we want to\nhave a goal of keeping separate state\nI guess maybe it should be scoped to\napplication state or something but but\nit's it's um it's not I mean if you're\nreligious about separate state it's not\nthat clear to me separate cleanly\n>> you wouldn't run a terraform controller\nin your kubernetes because that means\nyou're adding state to it or the\nterraform controller must have access to\nan external state bucket uh within the\n>> Yeah, it's got to it's got to be it's\ngot to be a very clear division, right?\n>> Yeah. So, that's a problem with\ncrossplane, right? Because where does\ncrossplane store that state tracking? It\nstores it inside the Kubernetes cluster\ncontrol plane.\n>> So, now you've created a stateful\ncontrol like control plane. You've\ncreated a stateful cluster.\n>> So, so that's where where like you know\nyou're using crossplane to bootstrap\nKubernetes and that becomes a stateful\ncluster. So you need like one Uber\ncluster that controls all the other\nclusters and that becomes your stateful\ncluster that you need to do very careful\nupgrades around operations are are\ndifferent. And of course it makes sense\nfor a company like Upbound which\nsponsors crossplane to say hey you know\nwe are your your Uber cluster we manage\nthat for you. We we provide you a\nstateful cluster. We guarantee that your\nyour control plane is backed up and can\nbe res restored and we're we're going to\ntake care of that. And that's the you\nknow the the managed service offering\nthat they provide. Um and that's why\nthey they they create something like\ncrossplane right. Um and I think Google\ncloud went the same way. They have like\nservice connect or config connect. They\nhave a service in GCP that's very\nstrongly based on of off crossplane that\nbasically you you you you define and and\nto be honest Kubernetes is already\ntaking care of a lot of your a your\ncloud resources right because when you\nsay I have a service and I need to make\nmake it externally exposed it goes and\ncreates a load balancer right so you\nalready have a cloud controller inside\nKubernetes creating um AWS resources you\nhave a controller that creates nodes to\nadd capacity to the cluster you have a\ncontroller that that um creates um\nrouting rules if you are depending on\nwhat type of uh networking that you set\nup so that your your uh routing tables\ncan route the traffic between your pots\nacross the nodes. So, Kubernetes control\nplane already modifies your cloud and\ncreates resources in the cloud. So, it\nmakes sense to extend that and also\ncreate databases and buckets and\n>> Yeah. Yeah. This is this is where things\nget look crazy to me.\n>> Yeah. I mean I I [sighs] see the point.\nI I think if you're going all in and\nyou're a big Kubernetes shop, it makes\nsense. The only biggest issue I have\nwith Kubernetes is that you have these\ndeclarative YAML that becomes super hard\nto to manage and then solutions like\nconfig hub make sense because now you\ncan define your load balancers, your\nbuckets, your databases, everything in\nconfig hub and let the reconciliation\nloop constantly. tell okay maybe let's\nturn the conversation back to AI like if\nyou were to if you were if you were to\nlike start on a green field project and\nuse Claude to to set up um\nI don't know we kind of do need to scope\nthis to some sort of example let's say\nthat we need to run um I don't know\nWordPress\nat scale you know WordPress.com\nUh, so PHP, MySQL, blah blah blah.\n[snorts] the\n>> be careful. Would you do would you do\nthat in Kub would you do that in\nKubernetes and and just let Claude\nspin up some\nuh I don't know CDK uh what did we call\nit CDK Kubernetes like what what would\ngive the best\niteration you know what would give the\nbest AI friendliness slash\niteration loop\nis what I'm thinking\nOh. Um, so this are you thinking about\nwhat type of system would be able to\nleverage AI in the me like the best way?\nYeah. Would be intuitive to the AI,\nright?\n>> Exactly. So, so the so that kind of\nassumes some the AI is sort of maybe\nkind of familiar to the workflow. I\nmean, you don't want to spend too much\ntime teaching it something new, I\nsuppose, is what I'm trying to lose.\n>> So, that's where everyone jumped on\ncreating MCP servers or or finding ways\nto to provide the LLM, the generic LLM\nthat has been trained of lots of data to\nbasically give it the right context for\nthe work that it needs to do. So, if\nyou're take a generic\n>> MCP, MCP is more for doing tool calls\nthan giving context.\nSome people seem to mix that up a bit.\n>> I think it's No, it's the difference is\ntool calls allow you to pull in context\non demand. The LLM sees a tool that says\nyou can call me to get information about\nthe weather in in London. Um, you can\ncall me.\n>> So, it's tool calls\n>> give the LLMs the arms and legs to reach\nout into the world to find information\nthat it doesn't have.\n>> So, it can do it on its own. If you if\nyou don't use tool calls, you as an\noperator of the LLM have to kind of\nfigure out everything that that LLM\nmight need to solve the problem that\nyou're trying to do, right?\n>> On the subject of tools, you know,\nKubernetes tools, cubectl is pretty\npretty awesome, isn't it?\n>> Um, so that's where things have evolved,\nright? If you if you use cloud code\nskills and you give it a high level\noverview what cubectl can be used for\nand then it goes and finds out more\ninformation about like the user has a\nproblem uh with autoscaling and I need\nto figure out if there's enough capacity\nin the cluster and then it goes off and\nuh finds the cubectl commands that you\nknow tells it how much like the top like\nnode stop for example to see how much\nCPU is being used across the cluster.\nSo, so skills are this like gradual\ndiscovery of information without\noverloading the context with every\npossible\nuh tool that the QTL exposes, right?\nbecause ultimately cubectl can be used\nin such a way that you can overload um\nwith like hundreds of tools but you you\nneed to slice it and dice it down into\nlike you know if you're working on this\nparticular problem then you might want\nto look at this set of tools uh and if\nyou want to work on that type of problem\nyou want to look at this set of tools so\nthen cloud knows like hey I'm looking at\nthis type of problem oh can can we go\nlook at those set of tools and then\nloads them in and figures out that it\nneeds to like\n>> that's what what what the skills changed\ncompared to tools.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But like yeah, sorry.\n>> But which which infrastructures code\ntechnology has the best tooling in that\nregard?\nKubernetes does come into my mind\nor do you think CDK is uh I mean are you\nmanaging infrastructure with AI and CDK\nis my next question.\n>> Actually funny I can give you an\nexample. Um because when I built Terra\nconstructs I copied the AWS CDK\ninterfaces. So my company they adopted\nGitHub copilot into PR review process\nand my colleague created a pull request\nwith Terra constructs that basically\ncreates a load balancer sets up\nlisteners and things like that but the\ncode is TypeScript and it looks like AWS\nCDK. So copilot started to to comment on\nit and say like hey um your load\nbalancer listener here uh is not using\nTLS or whatever. So even though um you\nknow it hasn't been trained on terra\nconstructs and\n>> and it had no it had no like uh what do\nyou call this type hinting or\n>> no nothing I I I think you know big part\nof the corpus I don't think we can\nimagine how much of of of you know these\nweights actually encapsulate it's like\nbillions of of internet data you can ask\nit something silly like um you ask about\ncats in in in in uh in Dermund Belgium\nand they will tell you about a tradition\nback in the Middle Ages where they throw\ncats off the walls and it's like who\nwould know that, right? And and it's not\nmade up like it's true.\n>> Why did they throw cats onto walls?\n>> After the winter um they they they kept\ncats to kill to prevent the mice to eat\nthe grains or something or to bite the\nrats or the mice were were destroying\nthe all of the storage like the linen\nand so on. So, so they have cats to\nhunt, but then when the summer comes\naround, they have too many cats, so they\nthrew them off the off the off the\ntowers. Uh, tradition, Belgian\ntradition.\n>> So dark. [laughter]\n>> So, this is one thing,\n>> but with Belgian, it's always like some\ndark stories like\n>> Yeah. So, if it knows this horrible\ndetail that we Belgians have been trying\nto hide, how of course it's going to\nknow how to write AWS CDK, you know.\n[laughter]\n>> Interesting. So, so you're basically\nsaying that it doesn't matter what you\nuse, AI is going to be flexible enough\nto get you there.\n>> And what I'm saying is for me and the\nreason why I spend all this time on what\nI'm doing for me AI is is pure\nintuition, right? All of this\nhallucination which we sometimes we\ndon't like, but sometimes it is pure\nlike out of the box thinking and we\nembrace it. All of this hallucination is\nintuition. it's built into the model to\nlike feel like that's the way I need to\ngo. So whatever you know framework you\nwork with should be an intuitive\nframework. So I feel AWS CDK is\nbeautiful because it's all about\nintentoriented methods. It's not like\nthis massive declarative get every\nsingle attribute correct or it's not\ngoing to work. It's intuitive. It's like\nI want to deploy I want to deploy my\nservice. I want to spread it one per\nnode. Um and and I want the spot\ndisruption budget. That's a good\nintuition.\n>> Yeah. So that's where I feel like it's\nbeen trained heavily on Typescript and\nJavaScript because that's like still in\nthe top one languages of of Stack\nOverflow every year. So it has a massive\namount of JavaScript samples and\nTypeScript samples. It has I don't know\nprobably more JavaScript and it has the\nideas and hallucinate and hallucinates\nconstantly. It's actually not Lams is\nall hallucination like every single\ntoken it outputs is just hallucination\nand int intuition right so the fact that\nit's correct these hallucinations are is\nis mindboggling right uh but the fact\nthat it can generate AWS CDK correctly\nand in Typescript to me is proof that I\nwould rather um focus on a highle\nlanguage like that\n>> yeah but don't you think it's strange\ndon't don't I mean surely\ngoing back to what I was asking earlier\nlike so you don't give a type hinting\nlike surely if you if you if you let uh\nClaude I mean VS code must somehow do\nthis but like if you open up a project\nwith with uh with with type checking\nthen\nand you let AI make some you let Claude\nmake some changes surely it it can\nrecognize that it's done a bad change\nwhen the uh LSP starts That's this is\nthe agent's shell, right? This is how\nthe shell surfaces the information\nto the LLM. It captures a whole bunch of\ninformation. It also gives it guidelines\nlike I made a change. Like if you look\nat cloud, it will say I made a change to\nthis file. Let me make sure I don't know\nit says low bandwidth. Maybe my\nconnection is bad.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. You just dropped out a bit.\n>> Sometimes cloud says,\n>> yeah. So, so cloud will say I made a\nchange to this file. Let me run the\ntests or let me let me run this. This is\nlike agent shell instructions, right?\nThis is like part of cloud code's magic\nsauce. It just it just says like you do\nthis then you do that. You run this\ntool. You connect to the IDE and look\nfor the problem. If you go to Visual\nStudio Code, you can see problems and\nsay file. Exactly.\n>> Yeah. Language servers integrations and\nso on. So this is agent cell. This is ID\ncontext. This is what makes a coding\nagent good at what it does by by\nsurfacing the information in small bits\nright when it's needed. Um,\n>> yeah, it's it's it's it's such an\nincredible technology, isn't it? It's so\nincredible.\n>> And and so what I wanted to give you an\nexample of where I think it's obvious\nthat cloud will not be good at doing\nthings with Terraform compared to AWS\nCDK.\n>> Okay, juicy. I had the requirement\na theory to set up swap files for nodes\nbecause we wanted to allow bursting. You\nknow, you can overshare resources on a\nnode and we wanted sometimes resources\nto be overs subscribed and some services\nto basically burst out and take more\nmemory than the node has. So we wanted\nto alleviate some of the pressure by\ncreating a swap file on disk. So I asked\ncloud to help me prepare the launch\ntemplates for the autoscaling group. And\nthis was pure terapform, no AWS CDK. And\nto do the swap file configuration, you\nhave to define the swappiness on the\ntask definition. But on Terraform, the\ntask definition is a massive JSON blob,\nright?\n>> It's just a massive JSON definition. And\ncloud can do like the first level of of\nof um of attributes of this JSON\ndefinition. it it can do it decently,\nbut it when I mention about swappiness,\nit also just put the attribute\nswappiness straight on like the the top\nlevel as an attribute as a field on a\nJSON document and it didn't work. Uh or\nit looked like it worked. It didn't give\nme any errors, right? But when I looked\ninto it, it actually didn't work. And I\nhad to look really deep into AWS docs to\nfigure out that swappiness was not a top\nlevel field, but was nested within\nsomething called kernel attributes or\nsomething like that. So on the ECS task\ndefinition, you had to create a field\ncalled kernel attributes. I'm not sure\nI'm just making that up, but it was\nsomething like that.\n>> And then there was a field under there\ncalled swappiness that you had to set to\nlike a certain value to actually take\neffect. Now both the AWS API did not\nthrow an error because it just ignored\nany unknown fields and and cloud did not\nknow what was wrong because it's just\nit's just a JSON blob. But if I look at\nAWS CDK, they actually exploded this\nthis this into a construct. They created\na task definition construct and every\npossible field um is properly structured\nin a TypeScript interface. So if you put\nswappiness of the top level, you get a\nTypeScript error that doesn't compile.\n>> Yeah, but that but but you're assuming\nthat someone's done the work in the CDK\nband. And that's the craziness about the\nAWS CDK is that somebody has been doing\nthe work for 10 years and it's likeund\ncontributors and it's spread across\n>> but that could work against you. They\nmight not have been well maintained and\nyou can't set\n>> well that's why a framework like that\nneeds to be backed by the cloud\nprovider. This only works on AWS CDK\nbecause AWS invests resources into\nbuilding this library. And that's why\nAWS CDK is much more powerful than\nTerraform because it's backed by AWS and\nfine-tuned for its cloud.\n>> And\nthat's what they use internally is what\nwe\n>> exactly because when I look at the pull\nrequests, they're like, I'm at a service\nteam of AWS and we need this, you know,\nthis particular EC2 or task definition\nfield needs to be made available. On the\ntopic of CDK, um, let me just share my,\nuh, thing again. I had a question for\nyou on operational flexibility\nor operational features.\nOkay. So, so here's an example. Uh I'm\nI'm maintaining u let's just call it an\nairflow an AWS ma MWAA airflow instance\nat work and it's getting overloaded. I\nneed to scale it up quickly. So in\nterraform\nif I was man if I was managing airflow\nin terraform I would set the CPU type\nfrom\nI don't know T1 to T5 or something M1 to\nM5 or something right and then I do then\nI do a plan and then I do apply and I\ndon't know half an hour later the\ninstance of airflow would have been\nupdated\nin AWS CDK land\nUm, again, I don't think it's any\nfaster, right? You you would still have\nto go into your CDK code, change of\nchange something, and then do a CDK\ndeploy, and it's probably the the same\namount of time as the Terraform plan and\napply. Right?\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that is\nthat is there\num what's the quickest way to make a\nquick change in of these technologies\nbesides don't say click ops I mean yeah\nI I think click ops is probably the\nfastest you know what I mean the speed\nto make a change\n>> I don't think we captured it very well\n>> um\nyeah I\nIt's a trade-off, right, that you you I\nit's all or nothing in these frameworks,\nright? You either go all in and you make\nsingle source of truth, Terraform, and\nthere's no way of making a change\noutside of Terraform. Um or you\ncompletely ignore that attribute in\nterapform and then people can change it\nand Terraform will not complain or try\nto revert it. You know, you can say life\ncycle ignore this attribute so try to\nreset it. Um that's where other\nframeworks recently try to improve\nbecause they say by nature the cloud is\nbirectional. It's not one way. You know\nforcing your infrastructure as code to\nbe single direction single sort of truth\nin practice doesn't work. It slows teams\ndown and that's where config that all of\nwhat I just said is basically from a\nblock um series from Brian Grant, right?\nthe guy who who then announced uh Config\nHub. So, their idea is that you must be\nable to go into your config store and\nchange a value and have it applied\nquickly without going through a massive\num and slow uh process. But that's a\ntrade-off, right? I mean their point is\nthat if you do it through our system I\nguess there's more tracing and more\ncontrol over it than if somebody goes in\nclick ops at least as the config field\nis stored inside the data and you can\nhave an audit trails there. I don't know\nI do feel you get you can you know have\nyour cloud trail\nevents siphoned off to just note what\ninfrastructure changes they are.\n>> Yeah. Um so system initiative they also\nhave this idea of we are a digital twin\nand we synchronize whatever you do in\nAWS back\n>> I need I need to give assistive\nsystem initiative a trial before I meet\nup go meet up with\n>> they have great ideas I mean the people\nbehind it have a lot of experience with\nchef and puppet and there some of the\nyou know original creators of some of\nthe ideas of how chef originally worked\nand they carried over after working with\nTerafhone for a long time and and they\nthey they just built a new idea and the\nway I understood from his podcast that I\nI listen was that system system\ninitiative is a programmable graph. So\nyou create nodes and every node in the\ngraph has hooks like create, read,\nupdate, delete and those notes those\nhooks are all programmable. So you can\ndecide this node\nIt doesn't. Yeah. This node if it gets\ncreated, this is how the function runs.\nAnd this node if it needs to be updated,\nthis is what function it runs. And you\ncan therefore build your own nodes. It's\nkind of like terapform provider\nresources, right? But all split out into\nindividual node because a terapform\nprovider resource has create, read,\nupdate, delete hooks, right? And the\ntelephone provider just looks at the\ngraph, determines that note needs to be\nupdated and then calls the update hook\nfor that resource and gives it the um\nyou know the actual values and and the\nthe new values and then that resource as\npart of the provider will apply those\nchanges by making the correct AWS API\ncalls. Right? So they they kind of take\nthis terapform provider but they split\nit out into individual programmable\nnodes and then they they reimplemented\neach of those nodes. What I don't like\nas far as I understand is that under the\nhood every single function of those\nnodes is like using AWS CLI commands. So\nit doesn't like it\n>> and and\nI don't know because honestly if you I\nthink they spent four years rebuilding\nTerraform provider AWS by defining every\nresource type as a node and giving it\ncreate read update scripts you've only\ndone the very basic foundation because\nwhat really makes infrastructure as code\npowerful is like what I just told you 10\nyears of AWS CDK and hundreds of\ncontributors splitting out every\npossible field and building integration\npattern.\nRight?\nImagine you spend four years\nre-implementing Terraform providers and\noffering it as a solution and you\nhaven't even gotten to the level of like\nnow I have a lambda and a gateway and I\nneed to integrate them and that means I\nneed to call all of these resources and\nI need to call all of these hooks in\nsequence. You're you've you\n>> Yeah. But the\nbut in a in an in a in a in an ideal\nworld the AWS CLI should be exposing\nthese things should be exposing even\nthese high level obstructions in some\nways the AWS CLI\num I mean I'm just playing devil's\nadvocate here\n>> the CLI should be should be actually the\ninterface\nshould be enough is what I'm trying to\nsay.\n>> Yeah. So, I haven't played enough with\nsystem initiative, but I can imagine\nthat based on what he says, if they\nstarted from scratch, it would take an\nimmense amount of work to reach anything\nlike AWS CDK level of UX\n>> or DevX developer experience. And sure\nyou can show a demo which he says we you\nknow we have a demo where you give us\nyour AWS account and we point system\ninitiative and it at it and it will very\nquickly create your AWS account\nresources as a digital twin in our graph\nour programmable graph and you can\nimmediately start modifying them through\nour interface with our digital twin\ntechnology but that doesn't talk about I\nam a devop developer and I need to\ndeploy nextgs\nAnd I don't care how to set up API\ngateway and every single lambda so that\nnextgs has a server side and can execute\nright because that is what a developer\nwants to do. This is the actual\nfunctionality like I started Terraform\nsorry I started my career you know\nunderstanding how the control plane\nworks how reconciliation loops works but\nif you work for an organization\nnobody cares right we need to deploy the\nfeature and what is the best\narchitecture for us to deploy it I don't\ncare how kubernetes you know atcd needs\nto be set up and backup procedures and\nall that you want to write code\n>> yeah I I that is the business value\nunless you're you're a hosted kubernetes\nthis cluster provider as a DevOps\nengineer you're coming in and only\nknowing how to set up clusters you don't\nbring any value unless you can do these\nhigh level integration patterns and\nafter you know it was very interesting\nfor me but after doing it for five or\nsix years I wanted to actually be\nvaluable [laughter] you know actually\nfocus on these hard\nlevel integration patterns as you'll as\nyou\nare only really possible with CDK right\nMhm.\n>> Yeah. So I CDK is great but there\nobviously I think other approaches like\nPulumi they I was very surprised because\nCDK has this as as I just explained it\nhas like these amazing deep level\nintegrations within the AWS services. So\nif you take a TypeScript object uh for\nthat represents an API gateway, it gives\nyou a method to to like bind it to a\nlambda and it knows exactly what to do\nunder the hood. Um Palumi is kind of\nlike starting from scratch and then\nbuild little like helper methods on top.\nFor example, the bucket object that you\nget within Palumi has the ID of like an\nonevent\num hook and and you can put the function\nhandler in that onevent.\nUh it's on the bucket object. You should\nsearch for bucket.onvent.\nAnd apparently that's not in their like\nL1s but also in in their like higher\nlevel on event. Yeah, I see it's in Pumi\ncrosswalks. So, so AWS CDK is like the\nthe L2, right? And Crosswalks is like\ntheir version of L2. It's like you take\nthe low-level bucket API object and then\nyou add ideas on top of like do onevent\nand and that's a really neat little\nthing. But again it required somebody at\npulley to implement the idea of a bucket\na cloudatch rule an SNS topic have this\nidea of invoking a function and does\nthey rep they they created a repeatable\npattern that on event you pack in you\npass in the function handler and it will\nautomatically create the bucket create\nthe lambda create the bucket\nnotification that calls the lambda set\nup the lambda permissions everything for\nyou right and then the only event is\nlike this this um this pattern that they\nexpose it's an interface because it's a\nprogramming language. So you can\nreimplement it. If you have something of\nyour own that you want to implement the\non event then you can implement exactly\nwhat are the grant permissions that need\nto be added to the policy. So you can\nimplement your own on event. So that's\nthe the the benefit of using a\nprogramming language. You can create an\ninterface. You can define a contract.\nYou can't do that with terapform\nmodules. Can you try to think about\ndoing that with terapform modules?\nWell, and I'm and going back to your IM\nexample\nto achieve these these priv privileges\nwithout some sort of dynamism is going\nto be hard.\n>> Yeah, that's exactly because of you have\nthis like synthesis time, lazy\nevaluation, late binding, setting\nproperties after the program has\nexecuted.\n>> But I can't think this cuts both ways. I\nmean\n[sighs and gasps]\nthere surely there's an argu there's an\nargument\n>> policy that you want to to attach\n>> there's there's an argument to be made\nis like as soon as someone starts\nwriting a whole bunch of code with with\nlike onvent uh logic it's going to get\npretty probably quite difficult to\nfollow right the beauty of opening up a\nlot of terraform projects is that you\nkind of know what's what's happening and\nit's kind of it's constrained by by the\nby the language right if if like just\nlike any code in the world if people can\ndo things they will and it will just get\ncomplex without any\n>> uh yes without any uh abandon right\n>> I just got the question to the today\nfrom someone he says like do you think\nthat it makes sense to target an\nintermediate DSL and and when you're\nsaying what you're saying just now it's\nLike with the terra constructs, if you\ndo this complicated coupling uh of of\ncreating a lambda in an API gateway\nultimately when you run synth you get a\nflat config file which is the DSL that\nis terraform and you can run your\nwhatever um you know llinters and\nproblems but it's probably going to be\nfishly complex but yeah okay\n>> yeah because the cloud is complex dude\n>> this was I Um the trade-off is you're\ngetting\ncapabilities,\nelasticity\nand uptime for services to move fast in\nterms of a business value and does it\nend up being complex? What's the\nalternative? You're going to spin up an\nEC2 instance and build your own and then\nyou know yeah on it there's different\nway there's different ways of looking at\nit like\nyou know, the more I need to give system\ninitiative a bit of a whirl to be\nhonest,\n>> but I'm I'm start I'm but like I'm I'm\nmy I'm working backwards from AI\nand I feel with AI it's about uh I mean\nit's also it's also about the same thing\nfor humans really it's about iteration\nspeed and uh\n>> and a to and a and a tool full chain\nlike I'm just thinking aloud that like\nmaybe calling AWS CLI from from Claude\nuh you know something where system\ninitiative does behind the behind the\nscenes is perhaps not a terrible way of\nuh bootstrapping an account right to\nwhat it needs to do for for for\na you know a typical a typical\norganization and let's take a step back\nwhat you just said about iteration and\nachieving results quickly. Um, it's kind\nof like how how I was understanding what\nyou're saying. I think this is also\nrelated to people like originally people\nwere like, \"Oh, Kubernetes is going to\ngive me this full cloud independence.\nI'm going to be able to do multicloud,\nyou know, as a resilience strategy and\nand and everything, right?\" Very quickly\nthat breaks down because the advantage\nof being in a cloud is to maximize its\ncapabilities. Like if you are an AI team\nand you need to set up like this complex\num data ETL pipeline, but you need to be\ncompletely cloud independent and you\nneed to do everything yourself versus oh\nI'm going to use some step functions or\ndurable lambdas now and I'm going to\nleverage all of the serverless\ncapabilities and I've got something\nworking you know because you have like\nDBOS you just define your your\nprogramming and then under the hood\nwhenever a function is called, it can be\nsuspended and it can be persisted and I\ndon't need to worry about exactly how\nall of that works. I can just focus pure\non my business flow and it's a neat\nclear data pipeline and under the hood\nit's it's automatically creating lambdas\nand they are being suspended when\nthey're waiting for events and they're\nresumable and it's taking care of of of\num making sure that the event is\npropagated and no notifications are\nbeing missed and and all of this like\nfall torren and and and re repeat and\nthat that letter Q setup and all of this\ncomplexity gets handled by a cloud layer\nand that gives you the ability to move\nforward and to deliver a feature that's\nbetween in in an organization\nthat's between being the market layer or\nbeing leader of being out of out of the\nmarket and closing down.\n>> I worked in many organizations.\n>> Well, okay. Just to replay my\nunderstanding what you just said is that\nlike if you don't uh\nget fine if if you don't\nget\n>> realize\n>> get down in the weeds then you're not\nreally innovating type is what I is what\nI heard.\n>> It's more about if you what is what\nbusiness are you delivering? What is\nyour core business right? your core\nbusiness is not creating a perfect ECS\ncluster and and taking care exactly of\nlike setting up um pipeline that that\ndoes exactly one delivery of all the\nmessages and and does does all of this\ncore like engineering most organizations\njust need to deliver business value or\nthey're or they they die\n>> they're out of business. Yeah. And then\nyou\n>> I think you made the argument that like\nyou can't do this in the CLI. You need\nto you need to get down into the the\ndetails. I mean sorry if I My link back\nto to what you were saying earlier about\num\nmy link back was basically\nmaximizing highle services of cloud\nwithout\num\nworrying about it not being reproducible\nor um yeah I don't know I I I had a\npoint\n>> okay we we I sorry I I my kids uh need\nto be taken to school so I ran out of I\nsound like I have a point just now. I\nneed to rewatch this to remember what my\npoint is.\n>> Okay,\n>> I'll put it in the comments.\n>> We'll we'll get to the point. Thanks for\nwatching if you're watching this. Bye.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:01] Welcome to episode 12 of the AI\n[0:03] Infrastructure Podcast with me, Kai\n[0:06] Hendry in the UK and Vincent Smith over\n[0:10] in Vietnam. In this episode, we talk\n[0:13] about CDKTF.\n[0:15] And long story short, we try to\n[0:17] rationalize where CDKTF fits in in light\n[0:21] of the recent deprecation by Hashi Corp/\n[0:23] IBM.\n[0:26] And\n[0:28] we we do justify CDK. Uh well, let me\n[0:31] give you a summary why we think CDK is\n[0:34] important.\n[0:36] It's a high level abstraction\n[0:39] and it allows complicated cloud\n[0:42] infrastructure to be reasoned about.\n[0:48] It allows you to get the most out of the\n[0:50] cloud to differentiate.\n[0:53] And if you just think conversely perhaps\n[0:56] if you got if you vibe coded your\n[0:59] infrastructure using I don't know AWS\n[1:01] CLI or something you just couldn't get\n[1:04] uh\n[1:06] a solid reproducible deterministic\n[1:10] infrastructure that way you need higher\n[1:12] level constructs uh that the AWS CDK\n[1:15] sort of provide you. So\n[1:21] you ideally need to work with it. So in\n[1:23] light of the deprecation of of IBM that\n[1:26] we need to find a place for for CDK a\n[1:30] programming language in order to do the\n[1:33] next level stuff with the cloud and\n[1:35] infrastructure. So enjoy the episode.\n[1:38] Please uh\n[1:41] if if CDKTF doesn't uh tickle your\n[1:44] fancy, check out the other stuff in the\n[1:46] playlist and have a merry Christmas. See\n[1:50] you. Goodbye.\n[1:52] Yeah, this guy. Which which guy?\n[1:55] >> So, since CDKTF was sunset by IBM and I\n[1:59] created a fork under a project that I\n[2:02] built a bunch of CDKF\n[2:04] L2 constructs. There's one guy who's\n[2:07] been contributing three PRs over\n[2:11] well so far he's contributed I think\n[2:14] seven PRs already and I merged six and\n[2:17] he keeps adding cool stuff. It's\n[2:19] amazing.\n[2:20] >> Yeah. So you just forked it and and\n[2:22] >> No, no, no. He contributes.\n[2:24] [clears throat]\n[2:24] So the one that I forked, I put it on\n[2:27] pause, right? We're waiting for a go-\n[2:29] ahead. Um we're collaborating with the\n[2:32] Open Construct Foundation which um hosts\n[2:36] several of the\n[2:38] you know CDK related projects and we're\n[2:41] trying to find a final and good name. Um\n[2:45] hopefully we don't have to rename but I\n[2:47] sincere I seriously doubt that Hashi\n[2:50] Corp is going to allow us to use the\n[2:52] original CDKTF package names. So we'll\n[2:55] probably have to rename it. And I\n[2:57] renamed the TCON which is Terra\n[2:59] Constructs. It's a four-letter acronym\n[3:02] and people obviously don't like that.\n[3:04] TCON sounds familiar now. [snorts]\n[3:07] >> Yeah. Terra Constructs is the library\n[3:08] that I built.\n[3:09] >> Oh okay.\n[3:11] >> Yeah. So tons is is what I you know it's\n[3:13] a scope that I have on npmgs. So I use\n[3:16] it for a lot of stuff. So I was like,\n[3:17] \"Yeah, I'm just going to reuse I just\n[3:19] took immediate action, right? Fork it\n[3:21] and rename it to my stuff and then\n[3:24] [snorts]\n[3:25] >> then um\n[3:27] >> yeah, so it it pushed my project in the\n[3:30] foreground and we're holding on the fork\n[3:32] because we don't have the final name and\n[3:34] I agree maybe we don't call it TCON, but\n[3:37] at the same time somebody else took\n[3:38] notice of my other project and has\n[3:40] contributed about eight PRs to it and\n[3:44] they are all high quality.\n[3:46] >> Can you show me? Can you get give me a\n[3:47] link? I just I'm just curious to see\n[3:48] what what what what you what what this\n[3:51] contribution is. [snorts]\n[3:52] >> Yeah. Uh\n[3:57] it's on my\n[3:59] here.\n[4:04] I have to get used to this um thing\n[4:08] jumping around. Hold on.\n[4:10] >> But you mean your Arch Linux C?\n[4:13] >> Yeah, I use I use Arch by the way.\n[4:18] It's never going to get old. Going to\n[4:20] keep saying it. Okay. I send it on Zoom.\n[4:24] >> Yeah. Like Primagin says a lot. Does he?\n[4:27] >> Does he just We're just following other\n[4:30] YouTubers. So sad.\n[4:33] [snorts] Uh\n[4:34] >> no. But then then I have to start\n[4:35] whining like Teo.\n[4:38] >> Shots fired.\n[4:41] >> I'm already doing a job whining. Right.\n[4:44] One complaint that I get from my YouTube\n[4:46] channel is that like, Kai, yeah, I like\n[4:49] your content, but you you you complain\n[4:51] too much, so I can't watch you. It's\n[4:53] like, what do I am I that guy?\n[4:59] Uh,\n[5:02] okay. Refactor, use AWS CDK. Oh, hold\n[5:05] on. Let me see if I can sh my screen.\n[5:09] I've been digging into that PR because\n[5:11] it actually enables really cool stuff.\n[5:16] So basically a little bit of background.\n[5:19] AWS CDK has this regional information\n[5:24] library\n[5:26] that keeps it track of like which\n[5:28] capabilities are available across the\n[5:30] regions. They download a fact table like\n[5:34] uh lambda runtime support for NodeJS\n[5:38] latest is version 22 in China or\n[5:40] government region for example but it's\n[5:42] version 24 for other regions where\n[5:45] NodeJS version 24 has already been\n[5:47] deployed right it takes time for this\n[5:48] stuff to deploy\n[5:50] >> so [clears throat]\n[5:51] other stuff is like uh S3 bucket\n[5:55] endpoints or like the domain suffix of\n[5:58] an S3 uh original endpoint point, right?\n[6:01] The URL suffix that um they changed the\n[6:04] way that that S3 works over the years.\n[6:07] So new regions, they use a different\n[6:09] suffix.\n[6:10] >> So the you know, I think I noticed that.\n[6:13] >> Yeah. So the AWS CDK has logic in it\n[6:16] that uses a fact table about the regions\n[6:18] to figure out how to build a a bucket or\n[6:22] like if you give it a a bucket URL or\n[6:25] just a bucket name and and it's it has a\n[6:27] it has a regional like your AWS CDK\n[6:30] stack has a region. So then it uses that\n[6:32] information to find out yeah what's\n[6:34] going to be the domain URL for that\n[6:36] bucket depending on the region. So I had\n[6:38] copied that over. I had copied over the\n[6:40] fact table into my code because I didn't\n[6:42] know it was a separate package. And he\n[6:44] says, \"Well, you know, we don't have to\n[6:46] copy over the details. We can just reuse\n[6:48] the AWS CDK package on top of CDKTF.\"\n[6:51] >> Cool. This actually looks like a pretty\n[6:52] good contribution. Holy moly. I'm I'm\n[6:54] >> Oh yeah, dude. All of his contributions\n[6:56] have been absolute fire. The only thing\n[6:58] is he doesn't write integration tests.\n[7:00] So every single one of them I I check\n[7:01] out and I um I I build an integration\n[7:04] test and I validate that you can\n[7:05] actually terraform deploy it into AWS\n[7:08] and doesn't get any errors. Yeah. But\n[7:11] he's been he's been aligning Terra\n[7:12] constructs closely to AWS CDK.\n[7:15] >> Cool.\n[7:17] So I got a couple of maybe noob\n[7:20] questions for you but like I guess this\n[7:23] might serve the audience.\n[7:26] So\n[7:27] CDK for Terraform\n[7:30] basically allow people to write in that\n[7:33] familiar CDK style which was\n[7:37] which was like which came out of\n[7:40] >> AWS\n[7:41] >> AWS uh what's his name? Ben Ben Israel\n[7:44] right that guy\n[7:46] >> not Ben Israel\n[7:48] >> um who was it again?\n[7:52] Is it worth mentioning her name?\n[7:55] Who? What? Sorry.\n[7:56] >> Who who who was the guy that was in the\n[7:59] original team that he left and he he did\n[8:02] did Wing Wing Lang?\n[8:04] >> Yeah. Elot Ben Israel. Uh Elot Ben\n[8:07] Israel.\n[8:08] >> Oh, I I wasn't wrong with the name.\n[8:10] Okay. Sorry.\n[8:10] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[8:11] >> I thought I was making up the his name\n[8:13] or something. So, CDK\n[8:18] cool beans. I think we went through\n[8:20] yesterday that it was like the the thing\n[8:23] that really makes it different is that\n[8:25] is that it's operationally\n[8:29] uh friendly. You can refactor this the\n[8:31] stuff\n[8:33] and it's a programming language un\n[8:35] unlike maybe Terraform and things like\n[8:37] that. Now the thing that I don't\n[8:40] understand is how it links up with\n[8:44] Terraform. A and B\n[8:48] what did actually CDK for Terraform\n[8:51] actually provide? Did they provide\n[8:53] everything that that uh Terraform\n[8:56] providers did or was it a subset?\n[9:00] Okay. So\n[9:03] the cloud development toolkit CDK from\n[9:07] AWS com is built upon and they've split\n[9:11] this out like some composible\n[9:14] um ideas. So one of them is the concept\n[9:18] of constructs. Constructs are basically\n[9:21] objects that\n[9:24] know how to synthesize or write themsel\n[9:27] out into like a small little snippet of\n[9:29] configuration,\n[9:30] >> right? If you use if you use a con and\n[9:33] they are able to be composed into trees\n[9:35] of constructs so you can nest constructs\n[9:37] into other constructs and so\n[9:41] >> yeah don't people sometimes call them\n[9:45] >> oh is my webcam just stopped don't don't\n[9:48] some people call them like stages or\n[9:50] something like that\n[9:51] >> no stages is something else I think it's\n[9:54] um if you are doing like cloud for\n[9:58] deployment across different\n[10:01] environments. I think you can define\n[10:03] stages,\n[10:04] >> okay,\n[10:05] >> to like duplicate stacks. I I mean I I\n[10:08] know that CDK pipelines uses stages. I\n[10:10] know that there's a concept of stages\n[10:11] within AWS CDK, but the thing is\n[10:15] first AWS CDK was built within AWS.\n[10:19] Right.\n[10:19] >> Right.\n[10:20] >> They had a couple of crucial innovations\n[10:23] in terms of infrastructure as code. The\n[10:25] first one is a tree,\n[10:29] a composition of configuration that\n[10:31] starts at the root note which is usually\n[10:33] your app, your entry point and from\n[10:36] there on you tie like a tree of\n[10:38] constructs and when you and each one of\n[10:41] them have a little bit of configuration\n[10:44] like information so they know how to\n[10:47] synthesize out into a configuration\n[10:50] target language. So if you use AWS CDK,\n[10:54] the constructs that you need are the\n[10:56] app, the AWS CDK app,\n[10:59] >> that synthesizes itself down to a cloud\n[11:01] for stack,\n[11:02] >> right?\n[11:03] >> And then each construct that you put\n[11:04] inside those apps\n[11:06] um will be a cloud for resource, right?\n[11:10] Because within a stack you use cloud\n[11:12] form resources, right?\n[11:13] >> Right.\n[11:13] >> And now if you apply those ideas on top\n[11:15] of Terraform,\n[11:16] >> right? So when when they port over the\n[11:19] the app, it's basically something that\n[11:21] represents a single terraform\n[11:24] uh root module, right? If you talk about\n[11:26] terraform modu um nomenclature or or\n[11:30] concepts\n[11:31] >> terminologies.\n[11:32] >> Yeah. Yeah. If you if you basically have\n[11:34] a directory and you drop in a config\n[11:36] file and then you run Terraform in it,\n[11:38] it will consider that directory as the\n[11:41] root module, right? And then if you\n[11:43] create another directory and you put in\n[11:45] some config there and then you include\n[11:47] that directory as a module that will be\n[11:49] like a sub module right. So in terapform\n[11:52] constructs are kind of like directories\n[11:54] of configuration files and you you um\n[11:57] source them into like module source and\n[12:00] then you can nest those modules as well.\n[12:02] But the one that is the actual um\n[12:07] you know app entry point is the root\n[12:09] module of your directory. Right? When\n[12:11] terraform runs, it will find the\n[12:13] terapform configurations in your\n[12:15] directly sibling files and aggregate\n[12:17] everything into a single config in\n[12:20] memory, right? Both HCL, which is a\n[12:22] separate set of JSON and some JSON if\n[12:23] you want. And then it will create in\n[12:25] memory your Terraform configuration.\n[12:28] And then within that root module, you\n[12:30] may refer to other modules that are\n[12:32] coming from either\n[12:34] >> it does it write it out as normal\n[12:35] Terraform. So you can inspect the\n[12:37] Terraform.\n[12:38] >> Yeah. So the the whole greatness of CDK\n[12:41] for Terraform is that ultimately what\n[12:44] you get once you synthesize or serialize\n[12:50] that construct tree down to the target\n[12:52] language you get pure and raw Terraform\n[12:58] >> and is is it is it readable or is it\n[13:01] like\n[13:02] >> it is\n[13:04] >> nonsense?\n[13:05] >> It's very readable. Uh there's a couple\n[13:08] of things that may you know make people\n[13:10] upset because in the construct tree\n[13:15] um the identity of a resource like if\n[13:17] you write terraform you're going to say\n[13:19] um AWS\n[13:22] instance and then you give it a name\n[13:24] like uh web and then you put in the\n[13:26] config attributes such as VPC ID\n[13:29] instance type imi like what's the image\n[13:32] that needs to be provided right so the\n[13:34] name right AWS instance And then you\n[13:37] have the name web in when you serialize\n[13:41] from from TypeScript down into that\n[13:43] config.\n[13:44] >> Yeah.\n[13:45] >> Kind of flattens everything. So it it\n[13:47] does some type of unique ID generation.\n[13:49] >> That's a good thing though. I thought we\n[13:50] we we discussed that.\n[13:52] >> No, it it's it creates an unique logical\n[13:55] ID. So that resource it's not your\n[13:57] physical ID because in in any case when\n[13:58] you create an instance in AWS your\n[14:00] physical ID is you cannot determine it\n[14:02] either, right? Not all AWS resources\n[14:04] allow you to determine your physical ID.\n[14:07] The instance ID is I- blah blah blah\n[14:09] blah. Your your load balancer ID is I is\n[14:12] LB- something. But if you do a bucket\n[14:14] and you say I want the bucket name to be\n[14:16] FU, it will be exactly FU and globally\n[14:18] unique. You will not get it even if\n[14:20] somebody else created a bucket fu.\n[14:21] Right? [snorts]\n[14:22] >> Um so so some resources they allow you\n[14:25] to determine or to define your physical\n[14:27] ID and some [snorts] resources they\n[14:30] don't allow you and they automatically\n[14:31] get an ID. But here I'm talking about\n[14:33] the logical ID, right? Even though the\n[14:36] logical ID will be something that you\n[14:37] write in your configuration file. So if\n[14:39] you ask me like does it serialize to to\n[14:42] readable terraform, it is just the logic\n[14:47] ids have these weird suffixes that you\n[14:49] can actually disable if you want. You\n[14:50] can actually go and say don't give me\n[14:52] these hash suffixes, but they're used to\n[14:54] make things unique. They're used to make\n[14:57] sure that the logic IDs don't have any\n[14:58] conflicts. So, [snorts] so that's the\n[15:01] only thing that I think people when they\n[15:02] first look at it kind of get annoyed by\n[15:04] is like why are these names so like have\n[15:06] this weird checksum like like you know\n[15:09] this hash at the end of the name. Uh and\n[15:12] that's purely because they don't want to\n[15:13] have a conflict or an error when you\n[15:15] have like nested parts that all get\n[15:17] serialized down into the root module.\n[15:19] >> Um so CDKTF also supports modules\n[15:22] Terraform modules by the way you can\n[15:24] refer to an existing Terapform module.\n[15:25] So it's very good for an existing team\n[15:28] that is already using terapform modules\n[15:30] extensively. With CDKTF, you can take\n[15:33] that terapform module and convert it\n[15:35] into a TypeScript interface. So it reads\n[15:38] the full module definition, looks at all\n[15:40] of the variables and their types\n[15:42] >> and then creates an equivalent type.\n[15:44] >> In my in my current client, we we we\n[15:48] switched to Terra. They they were\n[15:50] they're a CDK shop, but we but when I\n[15:53] joined, we we basically set up a new\n[15:56] workflow with Terraform because of\n[15:59] Snowflake.\n[16:00] But it sounds like I could have used\n[16:02] CDKTF to bring in the Snowflake\n[16:06] Terraform provider into into CDK world,\n[16:09] right? Or to Am I misunderstanding?\n[16:13] the CDKTF provider would allow you to if\n[16:18] you so so that's one thing right you can\n[16:21] create bindings for modules and it will\n[16:23] look at the variables that the module\n[16:24] take and then generate a typescript\n[16:26] interface or you can create bindings to\n[16:28] terapform providers like the so\n[16:30] snowflake provider and yes you will get\n[16:33] a TypeScript interface but no it will\n[16:35] not allow you to to use it with AWS CDK\n[16:38] right because AWS CDK only works with\n[16:40] cloud form and the CDKTF generated one\n[16:43] will generate terraform.\n[16:45] >> Yeah. Yes. So, but it Yeah.\n[16:49] I mean, to be honest, I'm not a huge fan\n[16:51] of all the I mean, this this this magic\n[16:57] converting different bindings of\n[16:59] different languages into CDK kind of\n[17:00] makes me nervous.\n[17:01] >> I I want to clarify one thing, right? in\n[17:04] itself\n[17:06] creating a terapform provider I mean\n[17:08] reading in the terraform provider\n[17:09] resources and generating TypeScript\n[17:11] bindings or Python orn net or whatever\n[17:14] on its own has very little value\n[17:16] honestly um you just get these like L1\n[17:20] constructs and you now can call that\n[17:25] constructor and maybe the one thing that\n[17:27] you get is you're able to use like um\n[17:30] lazy evaluations basically you And for\n[17:34] some attributes, you can provide a\n[17:35] function instead of an actual value. And\n[17:38] so when it synthesizes, it's going to\n[17:40] execute the function to basically decide\n[17:43] what the value for that property needs\n[17:44] to be. And that is very powerful\n[17:46] already, right? Because it means that\n[17:48] depending on how you call it, a function\n[17:50] can execute and then determine what the\n[17:52] value for this particular attribute\n[17:54] could be. Um, for example, if you are\n[17:57] where is this like really useful? Yeah,\n[17:59] maybe in policies, right? Let's say that\n[18:02] you you are you are building some type\n[18:04] of infrastructure and you're using an IM\n[18:06] policy and you're using a bunch of other\n[18:09] resources and you want the policy to be\n[18:12] generated at the very end after the user\n[18:14] has already defined the full program and\n[18:16] all of the configuration that he wants\n[18:18] to be\n[18:18] >> generated. Yeah, there's a lease\n[18:20] privileges type thing. M\n[18:21] >> yeah the functions can be very smart and\n[18:24] identify exactly what are the actions\n[18:27] that need to be added into the policy\n[18:29] depending on what the user um you know\n[18:33] connected. So it's kind of like it's\n[18:35] kind of a mixture of like an imperative\n[18:37] language to create a declarative\n[18:39] definition of infrastructure as code and\n[18:41] like people are like oh you know why\n[18:42] would you do that you know is all about\n[18:44] declarative and you you cannot do mix it\n[18:47] with imperative you start doing that\n[18:49] people will no longer like know exactly\n[18:51] what's going on uh but if you look at\n[18:54] the language itself since uh terraform\n[18:56] 0.12\n[18:58] you know before it became uh stable they\n[19:01] added um list comprehensions they added\n[19:05] dynamic values dynamic you know for each\n[19:08] and there's a very clear reason why they\n[19:10] did that because you can't manage AWS\n[19:13] resources with pure static definitions\n[19:16] you're always before that you have free\n[19:18] processors people wrote template\n[19:20] languages to generate terapform\n[19:21] configuration\n[19:22] >> yeah yeah I feel I feel this is a trend\n[19:24] in infrastructures co in infrastructure\n[19:27] game is like\n[19:29] the days have gone where you can just\n[19:31] declaratively put thing is in YAML,\n[19:34] right? You you need\n[19:35] >> you need a programming language and then\n[19:37] >> you're going to keep adding layers and\n[19:39] layers of abstraction to work around\n[19:40] this this core missing feature that you\n[19:44] are not working with a proper language\n[19:45] programming language and then you start\n[19:47] adding um config language.\n[19:49] >> Yeah. So generators\n[19:51] >> I guess in a in a very\n[19:54] uh succinct way CDK gives you the binds\n[19:59] to a proper programming language and\n[20:01] that's that's really what what it does\n[20:03] right [clears throat]\n[20:05] >> and but still I mean and then and then\n[20:07] it gives you the ability to do lazy\n[20:08] evaluations so late binding um so that\n[20:11] you can evaluate the full full program\n[20:14] and the user can program uh imperatively\n[20:16] build up the the configuration so he can\n[20:19] take some object that somebody else\n[20:21] wrote and then invoke some methods on it\n[20:24] to mutate this, you know, the the the\n[20:27] object to their liking.\n[20:28] >> Like for example, in in CDK for\n[20:30] Kubernetes, um when you create a\n[20:33] deployment, it's going to define a pot\n[20:35] template and then a replica uh count\n[20:38] that how many times you want that\n[20:39] template to be created um to create the\n[20:42] pots, right? And and then you want maybe\n[20:44] to set some type of anti-affffinity. So\n[20:47] you can do all of that declaratively in\n[20:49] in Kubernetes and it's not a simple\n[20:51] configuration system because to define a\n[20:53] pot template with anti- affinity rules\n[20:56] um to be fully flexible and this is also\n[20:58] why people like compose right compose is\n[21:00] super simple but like Kubernetes has all\n[21:02] the little dials and knobs.\n[21:05] >> Sorry what's compose oh with a K. You\n[21:07] mean\n[21:07] >> docker compose um you know before that\n[21:09] or ECS people like\n[21:11] >> oh docker compose oh okay\n[21:13] >> yeah I love docker compose because it\n[21:16] gives you like this very simple thing\n[21:18] but if you want to do something earlier\n[21:20] you were complaining um yesterday you\n[21:22] were complaining you were saying\n[21:23] verscell is great but if you want to do\n[21:25] like um custom type of database I can't\n[21:28] do it you know I need the dials and\n[21:30] knobs well that's where it breaks right\n[21:32] these abstractions so the same way way\n[21:34] with compose and and and that's why\n[21:36] kubernetes as like everything under the\n[21:37] sun, right? You can define exactly what\n[21:39] resources on the node need to be\n[21:41] >> for days and crossplane.\n[21:43] >> Yes. And and and and so the actual\n[21:46] configuration you have to write becomes\n[21:47] super complicated. Kubernetes is the\n[21:49] same thing. You end up with like\n[21:52] >> what is the Yeah. So I got CDK is the\n[21:55] programming language answer to maybe uh\n[21:59] Terraform. But what is what is the\n[22:01] programming language answer to to\n[22:04] you know Kubernetes?\n[22:06] So AWS built CDK for Kubernetes. There's\n[22:09] one guy Ilia, he did a lot of like he's\n[22:12] one of the main contributors.\n[22:14] Yeah, I loved it. Like initially it was\n[22:16] a bit frustrating because you\n[22:18] >> Yeah, because one of the things you\n[22:20] learn as a Kubernetes administrator and\n[22:22] if you go for certificates, which I\n[22:23] never do because I don't think they're\n[22:24] worth it. Um,\n[22:26] >> oh dear God, don't go there. That's a\n[22:28] rabbit hole.\n[22:29] >> Yeah. So\n[22:29] >> is this another Ben Israel thing? Um,\n[22:33] no, but it comes from within AWS, but it\n[22:36] applies the same idea of of creating a\n[22:38] tree of constructs and and and the same\n[22:41] idea of building like the core\n[22:43] Kubernetes API objects which are pod\n[22:46] deployment, replica set, um, service and\n[22:50] all of these, right? And now he's doing\n[22:53] robotics.\n[22:55] >> Anyway, so Ilia is one of the guys that\n[22:58] like I see contribute and react and\n[23:00] still maintain this project mostly. I'm\n[23:01] sure there's other people working on it.\n[23:03] But the greatest thing here is\n[23:05] >> the moment you have built those core API\n[23:07] objects, you can still write this, you\n[23:10] know, create your Kubernetes\n[23:12] configuration, but it's honestly worse\n[23:15] worse than YAML because you have all\n[23:17] these additional curly braces and very\n[23:19] nested like complicated configuration.\n[23:21] So pure L1 constructs, this pure\n[23:24] language binding are not very useful.\n[23:27] But what's immensely useful when you\n[23:30] work with CDK for Kubernetes is that\n[23:32] they built these higher level ideas of\n[23:36] like we're going to grab this low-level\n[23:38] API object that's called a deployment\n[23:40] and we're going to add a scheduling\n[23:42] namespace and we're going to add the\n[23:45] idea of spreading pods on the scheduling\n[23:48] namespace and suddenly you are defining\n[23:50] like I want to spread this across nodes\n[23:53] and there you basically you go like my\n[23:55] deployment.spread spread dot uh sorry my\n[23:58] deployment.sccheduling.spread\n[24:00] spread as a method. Your intention is to\n[24:03] spread these pots. That's your\n[24:05] intention, right? And that gets\n[24:07] translated into a declaration, an actual\n[24:10] rule.\n[24:11] >> Yeah. So,\n[24:13] >> the affinity\n[24:14] >> these convenient Yeah, that sounds like\n[24:16] a good useful abstraction.\n[24:18] >> Plus,\n[24:19] >> so what what abstractions?\n[24:21] >> Oh, plus, sorry. Yeah, plus is is the\n[24:24] the the the real power because that's\n[24:26] where they they create these high level\n[24:28] like deployment and chron job and and\n[24:31] then you and they make service and and\n[24:33] then they have like reasonable defaults.\n[24:35] So with very few lines of code it's kind\n[24:38] of like Helm, right? But Helm is\n[24:41] declarative like YAML config files with\n[24:43] no schema. So you don't get\n[24:44] IntelliSense. you don't know exactly\n[24:46] like where do I need to put this\n[24:48] configuration for it to end up where it\n[24:49] needs to be because YAML helm doesn't\n[24:52] have any schemas and even in later\n[24:54] versions they try to add schemas but it\n[24:56] doesn't really work.\n[24:56] >> So have you have you used this\n[24:58] production or you just checked it out?\n[25:00] >> No I I I I\n[25:03] was at an organization that had\n[25:04] everything under the sun. They had helm\n[25:06] they had JSONet they had customized they\n[25:08] had\n[25:08] >> Oh my god.\n[25:09] >> Yeah. They had everything.\n[25:10] >> And did you introduce something new\n[25:11] while you were there? Of course, I I I\n[25:14] built a new standard, but I [laughter]\n[25:15] did more than that. I did not just add a\n[25:17] new standard. I actually built a bunch\n[25:19] of migration tools for everything else.\n[25:22] So, I I had like a very clear path like\n[25:24] if this is a service that you're working\n[25:26] on and we we were adopting Argo CD and\n[25:28] the only way to adopt Argo CD was to\n[25:30] adopt CDK for Kubernetes. So, I made it\n[25:33] so that you can't go and manage your\n[25:35] service with Argo CD without\n[25:37] >> I don't think we've ever really talked\n[25:38] about GitOps. Are you a GitOps? I mean,\n[25:41] do you have uh any opinions there\n[25:44] quickly?\n[25:47] >> Yes, I I\n[25:49] >> maybe save that for another video.\n[25:52] I [snorts] ran Argo CD since 2019\n[25:55] and very quickly realized that a lot of\n[26:00] people like to do magic on the server\n[26:03] side and they like to minimize the\n[26:05] configuration that goes in and then they\n[26:08] like to Argo CD to like expand\n[26:10] everything using Helm uh rendering like\n[26:13] last minute.\n[26:14] >> Oh no no no. You want Argo CD just to be\n[26:16] a UI is is or\n[26:18] >> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You want Argo CD to\n[26:21] take whatever is in git and fire it\n[26:22] straight at Kubernetes. Exactly. And\n[26:24] then get back to that's that's one thing\n[26:26] I I use Argo CD and ang\n[26:31] >> crazy like why mix it up.\n[26:34] >> Yeah. So some so they build all these\n[26:35] amazing customized plugins and Helm\n[26:38] plugins to run on the Argo City server\n[26:40] and that's the first thing I throw out\n[26:42] because you want\n[26:44] >> you and I\n[26:46] pattern\n[26:47] >> sorry\n[26:48] >> you and I are the are a little bit too\n[26:50] similar\n[26:52] >> but but you know why this is relevant\n[26:54] because this is called the rendered\n[26:56] manifest pattern and the co and the core\n[26:59] creator of Kubernetes like one of the\n[27:00] co-founders Brian Grant and one of the\n[27:03] co-founder founders of of of the idea of\n[27:05] githops uh for flux with weave and you\n[27:08] know there's flux cd and there's argo cd\n[27:12] >> yeah I don't yeah flux used to be a\n[27:14] contender right\n[27:15] >> I think ar flux is still a contender\n[27:17] they broke it down into microser they\n[27:20] make it it's way more performant but it\n[27:22] doesn't have a fancy UI so everyone\n[27:24] loves Argo CD but nobody like flux is\n[27:27] still evolving but again like I haven't\n[27:29] ran communities for 2 years but what I\n[27:32] wanted to say is that the guys that are\n[27:35] very, you know, smart people, [laughter]\n[27:38] Brian Grant and um Richardson, uh from\n[27:40] Weave, they created the logical\n[27:44] extension of this rendered manifest\n[27:47] pattern. So basically the idea of like\n[27:49] you you make sure that everything gets\n[27:52] rendered down into manifest into git. So\n[27:54] Argo CD can purely track a raw manifest\n[27:57] and just fire it off after Kubernetes\n[28:00] and then you you are able to validate\n[28:01] immediately what is the error message\n[28:03] that that Kubernetes sends back because\n[28:04] it just relates directly to whatever you\n[28:06] have in git. So you can see very\n[28:08] clearly. So they evolved that pattern\n[28:10] and they call it config hub. So instead\n[28:12] of just like having a very dumb git\n[28:14] database, they built a specialized\n[28:16] database for for for uh storing these\n[28:19] configurations. And then the idea of\n[28:22] like um making a change, you can go\n[28:24] straight into config hub and make a a\n[28:26] change where it needs to be. So you\n[28:28] don't need to go through the git\n[28:29] pipeline. Um and then you can also call\n[28:32] functions if you need to make a change\n[28:33] across\n[28:34] >> I thought we thought I thought we\n[28:35] established that changing things outside\n[28:37] the the pipeline is a bad idea.\n[28:40] So, so they turned it upside down and\n[28:43] they they provided an a config hub that\n[28:47] helps you make changes in a controlled\n[28:49] way and in a repeatable way because it's\n[28:51] kind of like functional programming. You\n[28:53] can register endpoints on top of your\n[28:55] config data and then you can apply\n[28:57] functions. So, mutate your config data\n[28:59] across your whole environment and then\n[29:01] you can do it with an approval step uh\n[29:03] workflow. So you you just select what\n[29:05] you want to affect, you apply the\n[29:07] function, you can see a preview, and\n[29:09] then you can approve and then boom, it's\n[29:10] GitOps. It gets ops in a in a in a like\n[29:14] reasonable way.\n[29:15] >> Have you used this product? Have you\n[29:17] used this yourself?\n[29:19] >> Uh no, but I um I understand the idea\n[29:22] because a lot of what what he built\n[29:24] originally with customize, you know, the\n[29:26] idea of applying JSON patches, they kind\n[29:28] of like extended it as those get JSON\n[29:31] patches now run as part of like ant\n[29:33] hooks. haven't used it. They just made\n[29:35] it like\n[29:35] >> Oh, yeah. We were talking about hooks\n[29:37] yesterday. What was using hooks again?\n[29:39] Oh my god.\n[29:42] >> Oh, can do can do\n[29:44] >> Yeah. Yeah. The hooks thing is\n[29:46] >> in the CDK as well.\n[29:48] >> This kind of a little bit different.\n[29:50] Hooks.\n[29:51] >> Yeah. But this one in my mind\n[29:54] >> I don't know if config hub can can\n[29:56] manage any other configuration except\n[29:59] for Kubernetes. This this is like firmly\n[30:01] settled in the idea of like a\n[30:03] reconciliation loop and and having a\n[30:05] control plane that runs that constantly\n[30:08] runs these reconciliation loops and\n[30:10] automatically adjust your like with\n[30:12] eventual consistency adjust your your\n[30:14] cloud towards it. Right?\n[30:17] >> So which is one thing that Terraform\n[30:19] does not have right terraform you run an\n[30:21] apply and it doesn't touch it until the\n[30:23] next time you run an apply where\n[30:24] Kubernetes is constantly re-evaluating\n[30:27] your infrastructure and making sure that\n[30:28] it is aligned. I the the one thing\n[30:33] uh\n[30:35] [snorts]\n[30:35] was so like let me start with the\n[30:38] problem at what we're using terraform\n[30:42] uh actually this is a problem with CDK\n[30:44] too the whole CDK deploy thing is a bit\n[30:46] slow but okay never mind that\n[30:48] >> that's cloudformation issues\n[30:49] >> that's that's infrastructures yeah\n[30:51] that's that's cloudformation issues but\n[30:54] um stop me if I talked about this before\n[30:57] but one one issue that we have right now\n[30:59] is that we're using uh database we're\n[31:02] using Terraform to to manage Snowflake\n[31:05] and we don't want to we don't want to\n[31:06] delete the resources because that could\n[31:08] lead to data loss and all\n[31:10] >> stuff and we don't want to recreate\n[31:12] resources. So, so I have I have like\n[31:15] some crappy\n[31:16] >> worried about constantly re like\n[31:18] >> Yeah, I have some crappy what do you\n[31:20] call it? You know, uh GitHub workflow\n[31:23] where I basically inspect the plan to\n[31:25] make sure to make sure it's not deleting\n[31:28] anything. But I thought to myself, come\n[31:30] on, there's got to be a better way\n[31:31] because because right now we have a we\n[31:34] have a separate plan and an apply stage.\n[31:35] Why? Because we want people to do a plan\n[31:38] before they know what they're doing\n[31:40] before they delete things.\n[31:42] Unfortunately, no one really reads the\n[31:44] plan in all honesty. So, there's that\n[31:47] problem. So, so hence I have some crappy\n[31:50] code to check for for some a deletion or\n[31:53] a a recreate. And I just think to\n[31:56] myself, is this the way people do it? Is\n[31:58] there a better way?\n[32:01] I mean, that that sort of life cycle\n[32:05] type thing kind of sucks.\n[32:08] That's my current.\n[32:09] >> Yeah. And that's also why a lot of\n[32:11] people when we talk about crossplane\n[32:13] there people very um\n[32:17] pessimistic around it because they put\n[32:19] so much um official or orchestration\n[32:22] around this you know plan and apply.\n[32:25] they have a a big like ceremony around\n[32:29] the process and so something going\n[32:31] behind the scene and constantly\n[32:33] reconciling kind of feels wrong to them,\n[32:35] right? Uh and I think it really depends\n[32:37] on the maturity. If you're Google and\n[32:40] you're deploying a thousand times a day,\n[32:41] your services are reconciling and this\n[32:43] is how you build your architecture. I\n[32:44] guess if you I guess the there's an\n[32:47] there's an adage with when it comes to I\n[32:50] mean this is probably one of the first\n[32:51] things I learned when I got into\n[32:52] infrastructure is like don't manage your\n[32:56] database in infrastructure is code\n[32:59] you know because because then you won't\n[33:01] have these problems like separate the\n[33:03] data\n[33:05] >> so that was definitely s uh like true\n[33:07] for the longest time because stateful\n[33:11] kubernetes cluster\n[33:12] >> like\n[33:13] maintaining database in and I think\n[33:15] there was a Kubernetes uh controller or\n[33:18] something where you could spin up a a\n[33:21] database and everyone said no this is a\n[33:23] terrible idea\n[33:24] >> and I and quickly caught on to why\n[33:28] >> if I talk about 2016 then stateful sets\n[33:31] are like just introduced.\n[33:34] >> Yeah.\n[33:35] And and so at the time the problem with\n[33:38] Helm is that everyone can just pull a\n[33:40] chart and go like, \"Oh, uh, Helm\n[33:42] installed MySQL. There I go. I have\n[33:44] MySQL now.\" Yes. But you know,\n[33:47] >> set up a huge cluster.\n[33:49] >> Yeah. What what where where is the data\n[33:51] stores? Oh, so it's provisioning an EBS\n[33:53] volume. How how is the ownership of that\n[33:55] EBS volume tracked? Like what if you do\n[33:57] an upgrade? How do you manage? And then\n[33:59] people they built this is like you know\n[34:01] pets versus cattle where you're building\n[34:05] yes you're creating a a cattle of nodes\n[34:07] but you're building pat kubernetes\n[34:09] clusters. So so what is the the point of\n[34:12] pat kubernetes clusters then you need to\n[34:14] start bu using arcane or whatever it's\n[34:16] called to to create backups of your\n[34:18] clusters and your control plane. I never\n[34:20] like that idea. I always made my cluster\n[34:23] completely stateless so that I can\n[34:24] rebuild it\n[34:25] >> a thermal I don't know.\n[34:27] >> Yeah. So all of all of the state lives\n[34:30] outside right that's how you want to\n[34:32] build your microservices if you can\n[34:34] depending on you know what is the SLAs\n[34:36] and and what is your your architecture\n[34:39] that you have to support um but if you\n[34:41] can and you can perfectly scale\n[34:43] horizontally and you keep all of your\n[34:44] data on a different tier outside of your\n[34:46] cluster then that makes life so much\n[34:48] easier because you can just blow away a\n[34:50] cluster and rebuild it. Yeah.\n[34:51] >> You can just put them side by side and\n[34:53] they can share the state outside of the\n[34:55] cluster. Um and then once you start\n[34:58] building stateful clusters, your SLOs's\n[35:00] are completely different. Your your\n[35:01] operations around those clusters are\n[35:03] completely different.\n[35:04] >> Yeah. But but don't you think that like\n[35:06] like just going going back to CDK like I\n[35:09] mean a lot of tooling does bring state\n[35:11] into it, doesn't it? A little bit.\n[35:15] Sorry about CDK and and like uh sorry to\n[35:18] I'm just trying to bring it back to\n[35:22] to CDK like like like doesn't CDK I\n[35:26] think we talked about it yesterday but\n[35:27] like doesn't CDK have like a strong\n[35:29] concept of context or something like\n[35:31] that and that in itself is a state isn't\n[35:34] it I mean\n[35:36] so on one side in these traditional\n[35:38] infrastructure as code frameworks you\n[35:40] have the concept of a state like cloud\n[35:42] form keeps track of the resources it\n[35:44] created And Terraform has a state file\n[35:46] that keeps track of the resources it\n[35:48] created. So that it knows, you know, it\n[35:50] ties back those logical ids in the state\n[35:53] file to the actual physical ideas. And\n[35:55] if you remove a logic ID in your\n[35:56] configuration, it will make sure that\n[35:58] that resource is deleted. And if you\n[35:59] modify the configuration,\n[36:01] >> yeah,\n[36:02] >> it will make sure that the actual\n[36:03] physical ID uh resource is updated.\n[36:05] Right. So\n[36:06] >> it uses a state file.\n[36:09] >> Yeah. So basically I'm just\n[36:12] uh wiring these in my brain. I mean I'm\n[36:15] crosswiring these in my brain. Like if\n[36:18] we have infrastructure and we want to\n[36:19] have a goal of keeping separate state\n[36:23] I guess maybe it should be scoped to\n[36:26] application state or something but but\n[36:28] it's it's um it's not I mean if you're\n[36:33] religious about separate state it's not\n[36:37] that clear to me separate cleanly\n[36:40] >> you wouldn't run a terraform controller\n[36:41] in your kubernetes because that means\n[36:43] you're adding state to it or the\n[36:45] terraform controller must have access to\n[36:47] an external state bucket uh within the\n[36:49] >> Yeah, it's got to it's got to be it's\n[36:51] got to be a very clear division, right?\n[36:52] >> Yeah. So, that's a problem with\n[36:54] crossplane, right? Because where does\n[36:55] crossplane store that state tracking? It\n[36:58] stores it inside the Kubernetes cluster\n[37:00] control plane.\n[37:01] >> So, now you've created a stateful\n[37:03] control like control plane. You've\n[37:04] created a stateful cluster.\n[37:06] >> So, so that's where where like you know\n[37:09] you're using crossplane to bootstrap\n[37:11] Kubernetes and that becomes a stateful\n[37:13] cluster. So you need like one Uber\n[37:15] cluster that controls all the other\n[37:17] clusters and that becomes your stateful\n[37:19] cluster that you need to do very careful\n[37:20] upgrades around operations are are\n[37:23] different. And of course it makes sense\n[37:24] for a company like Upbound which\n[37:26] sponsors crossplane to say hey you know\n[37:29] we are your your Uber cluster we manage\n[37:32] that for you. We we provide you a\n[37:34] stateful cluster. We guarantee that your\n[37:36] your control plane is backed up and can\n[37:38] be res restored and we're we're going to\n[37:40] take care of that. And that's the you\n[37:42] know the the managed service offering\n[37:44] that they provide. Um and that's why\n[37:46] they they they create something like\n[37:48] crossplane right. Um and I think Google\n[37:51] cloud went the same way. They have like\n[37:54] service connect or config connect. They\n[37:57] have a service in GCP that's very\n[37:59] strongly based on of off crossplane that\n[38:01] basically you you you you define and and\n[38:05] to be honest Kubernetes is already\n[38:07] taking care of a lot of your a your\n[38:09] cloud resources right because when you\n[38:11] say I have a service and I need to make\n[38:12] make it externally exposed it goes and\n[38:15] creates a load balancer right so you\n[38:17] already have a cloud controller inside\n[38:18] Kubernetes creating um AWS resources you\n[38:22] have a controller that creates nodes to\n[38:24] add capacity to the cluster you have a\n[38:26] controller that that um creates um\n[38:30] routing rules if you are depending on\n[38:32] what type of uh networking that you set\n[38:34] up so that your your uh routing tables\n[38:37] can route the traffic between your pots\n[38:38] across the nodes. So, Kubernetes control\n[38:41] plane already modifies your cloud and\n[38:44] creates resources in the cloud. So, it\n[38:46] makes sense to extend that and also\n[38:47] create databases and buckets and\n[38:50] >> Yeah. Yeah. This is this is where things\n[38:52] get look crazy to me.\n[38:54] >> Yeah. I mean I I [sighs] see the point.\n[38:58] I I think if you're going all in and\n[39:00] you're a big Kubernetes shop, it makes\n[39:02] sense. The only biggest issue I have\n[39:04] with Kubernetes is that you have these\n[39:06] declarative YAML that becomes super hard\n[39:08] to to manage and then solutions like\n[39:10] config hub make sense because now you\n[39:12] can define your load balancers, your\n[39:14] buckets, your databases, everything in\n[39:17] config hub and let the reconciliation\n[39:19] loop constantly. tell okay maybe let's\n[39:23] turn the conversation back to AI like if\n[39:26] you were to if you were if you were to\n[39:29] like start on a green field project and\n[39:31] use Claude to to set up um\n[39:37] I don't know we kind of do need to scope\n[39:40] this to some sort of example let's say\n[39:42] that we need to run um I don't know\n[39:47] WordPress\n[39:48] at scale you know WordPress.com\n[39:51] Uh, so PHP, MySQL, blah blah blah.\n[39:56] [snorts] the\n[39:58] >> be careful. Would you do would you do\n[40:00] that in Kub would you do that in\n[40:01] Kubernetes and and just let Claude\n[40:05] spin up some\n[40:07] uh I don't know CDK uh what did we call\n[40:12] it CDK Kubernetes like what what would\n[40:14] give the best\n[40:17] iteration you know what would give the\n[40:19] best AI friendliness slash\n[40:22] iteration loop\n[40:26] is what I'm thinking\n[40:29] Oh. Um, so this are you thinking about\n[40:33] what type of system would be able to\n[40:37] leverage AI in the me like the best way?\n[40:39] Yeah. Would be intuitive to the AI,\n[40:42] right?\n[40:42] >> Exactly. So, so the so that kind of\n[40:46] assumes some the AI is sort of maybe\n[40:50] kind of familiar to the workflow. I\n[40:53] mean, you don't want to spend too much\n[40:54] time teaching it something new, I\n[40:56] suppose, is what I'm trying to lose.\n[40:59] >> So, that's where everyone jumped on\n[41:00] creating MCP servers or or finding ways\n[41:03] to to provide the LLM, the generic LLM\n[41:06] that has been trained of lots of data to\n[41:09] basically give it the right context for\n[41:12] the work that it needs to do. So, if\n[41:15] you're take a generic\n[41:17] >> MCP, MCP is more for doing tool calls\n[41:19] than giving context.\n[41:22] Some people seem to mix that up a bit.\n[41:24] >> I think it's No, it's the difference is\n[41:27] tool calls allow you to pull in context\n[41:30] on demand. The LLM sees a tool that says\n[41:33] you can call me to get information about\n[41:35] the weather in in London. Um, you can\n[41:38] call me.\n[41:40] >> So, it's tool calls\n[41:41] >> give the LLMs the arms and legs to reach\n[41:44] out into the world to find information\n[41:46] that it doesn't have.\n[41:47] >> So, it can do it on its own. If you if\n[41:50] you don't use tool calls, you as an\n[41:52] operator of the LLM have to kind of\n[41:53] figure out everything that that LLM\n[41:55] might need to solve the problem that\n[41:57] you're trying to do, right?\n[41:59] >> On the subject of tools, you know,\n[42:01] Kubernetes tools, cubectl is pretty\n[42:04] pretty awesome, isn't it?\n[42:07] >> Um, so that's where things have evolved,\n[42:11] right? If you if you use cloud code\n[42:12] skills and you give it a high level\n[42:14] overview what cubectl can be used for\n[42:16] and then it goes and finds out more\n[42:17] information about like the user has a\n[42:19] problem uh with autoscaling and I need\n[42:22] to figure out if there's enough capacity\n[42:24] in the cluster and then it goes off and\n[42:27] uh finds the cubectl commands that you\n[42:30] know tells it how much like the top like\n[42:33] node stop for example to see how much\n[42:35] CPU is being used across the cluster.\n[42:37] So, so skills are this like gradual\n[42:39] discovery of information without\n[42:43] overloading the context with every\n[42:45] possible\n[42:46] uh tool that the QTL exposes, right?\n[42:49] because ultimately cubectl can be used\n[42:51] in such a way that you can overload um\n[42:53] with like hundreds of tools but you you\n[42:56] need to slice it and dice it down into\n[42:58] like you know if you're working on this\n[43:00] particular problem then you might want\n[43:02] to look at this set of tools uh and if\n[43:05] you want to work on that type of problem\n[43:06] you want to look at this set of tools so\n[43:08] then cloud knows like hey I'm looking at\n[43:10] this type of problem oh can can we go\n[43:12] look at those set of tools and then\n[43:13] loads them in and figures out that it\n[43:15] needs to like\n[43:16] >> that's what what what the skills changed\n[43:19] compared to tools.\n[43:19] >> Yeah. Yeah. But like yeah, sorry.\n[43:22] >> But which which infrastructures code\n[43:25] technology has the best tooling in that\n[43:28] regard?\n[43:30] Kubernetes does come into my mind\n[43:34] or do you think CDK is uh I mean are you\n[43:40] managing infrastructure with AI and CDK\n[43:42] is my next question.\n[43:43] >> Actually funny I can give you an\n[43:45] example. Um because when I built Terra\n[43:48] constructs I copied the AWS CDK\n[43:51] interfaces. So my company they adopted\n[43:55] GitHub copilot into PR review process\n[43:59] and my colleague created a pull request\n[44:02] with Terra constructs that basically\n[44:05] creates a load balancer sets up\n[44:06] listeners and things like that but the\n[44:08] code is TypeScript and it looks like AWS\n[44:11] CDK. So copilot started to to comment on\n[44:14] it and say like hey um your load\n[44:16] balancer listener here uh is not using\n[44:19] TLS or whatever. So even though um you\n[44:23] know it hasn't been trained on terra\n[44:24] constructs and\n[44:26] >> and it had no it had no like uh what do\n[44:29] you call this type hinting or\n[44:31] >> no nothing I I I think you know big part\n[44:34] of the corpus I don't think we can\n[44:35] imagine how much of of of you know these\n[44:38] weights actually encapsulate it's like\n[44:40] billions of of internet data you can ask\n[44:43] it something silly like um you ask about\n[44:46] cats in in in in uh in Dermund Belgium\n[44:50] and they will tell you about a tradition\n[44:52] back in the Middle Ages where they throw\n[44:54] cats off the walls and it's like who\n[44:56] would know that, right? And and it's not\n[44:58] made up like it's true.\n[45:00] >> Why did they throw cats onto walls?\n[45:02] >> After the winter um they they they kept\n[45:05] cats to kill to prevent the mice to eat\n[45:08] the grains or something or to bite the\n[45:10] rats or the mice were were destroying\n[45:12] the all of the storage like the linen\n[45:15] and so on. So, so they have cats to\n[45:17] hunt, but then when the summer comes\n[45:18] around, they have too many cats, so they\n[45:20] threw them off the off the off the\n[45:22] towers. Uh, tradition, Belgian\n[45:25] tradition.\n[45:27] >> So dark. [laughter]\n[45:29] >> So, this is one thing,\n[45:30] >> but with Belgian, it's always like some\n[45:32] dark stories like\n[45:34] >> Yeah. So, if it knows this horrible\n[45:35] detail that we Belgians have been trying\n[45:37] to hide, how of course it's going to\n[45:39] know how to write AWS CDK, you know.\n[45:42] [laughter]\n[45:44] >> Interesting. So, so you're basically\n[45:46] saying that it doesn't matter what you\n[45:48] use, AI is going to be flexible enough\n[45:50] to get you there.\n[45:52] >> And what I'm saying is for me and the\n[45:55] reason why I spend all this time on what\n[45:57] I'm doing for me AI is is pure\n[46:00] intuition, right? All of this\n[46:02] hallucination which we sometimes we\n[46:05] don't like, but sometimes it is pure\n[46:07] like out of the box thinking and we\n[46:09] embrace it. All of this hallucination is\n[46:11] intuition. it's built into the model to\n[46:14] like feel like that's the way I need to\n[46:17] go. So whatever you know framework you\n[46:19] work with should be an intuitive\n[46:21] framework. So I feel AWS CDK is\n[46:25] beautiful because it's all about\n[46:27] intentoriented methods. It's not like\n[46:30] this massive declarative get every\n[46:31] single attribute correct or it's not\n[46:33] going to work. It's intuitive. It's like\n[46:36] I want to deploy I want to deploy my\n[46:39] service. I want to spread it one per\n[46:41] node. Um and and I want the spot\n[46:43] disruption budget. That's a good\n[46:46] intuition.\n[46:47] >> Yeah. So that's where I feel like it's\n[46:49] been trained heavily on Typescript and\n[46:51] JavaScript because that's like still in\n[46:53] the top one languages of of Stack\n[46:55] Overflow every year. So it has a massive\n[46:57] amount of JavaScript samples and\n[46:59] TypeScript samples. It has I don't know\n[47:01] probably more JavaScript and it has the\n[47:04] ideas and hallucinate and hallucinates\n[47:06] constantly. It's actually not Lams is\n[47:09] all hallucination like every single\n[47:11] token it outputs is just hallucination\n[47:12] and int intuition right so the fact that\n[47:16] it's correct these hallucinations are is\n[47:19] is mindboggling right uh but the fact\n[47:22] that it can generate AWS CDK correctly\n[47:25] and in Typescript to me is proof that I\n[47:29] would rather um focus on a highle\n[47:32] language like that\n[47:33] >> yeah but don't you think it's strange\n[47:35] don't don't I mean surely\n[47:38] going back to what I was asking earlier\n[47:39] like so you don't give a type hinting\n[47:42] like surely if you if you if you let uh\n[47:46] Claude I mean VS code must somehow do\n[47:49] this but like if you open up a project\n[47:51] with with uh with with type checking\n[47:55] then\n[47:57] and you let AI make some you let Claude\n[47:59] make some changes surely it it can\n[48:02] recognize that it's done a bad change\n[48:04] when the uh LSP starts That's this is\n[48:07] the agent's shell, right? This is how\n[48:09] the shell surfaces the information\n[48:13] to the LLM. It captures a whole bunch of\n[48:15] information. It also gives it guidelines\n[48:16] like I made a change. Like if you look\n[48:18] at cloud, it will say I made a change to\n[48:19] this file. Let me make sure I don't know\n[48:21] it says low bandwidth. Maybe my\n[48:22] connection is bad.\n[48:23] >> Yeah. Yeah. You just dropped out a bit.\n[48:26] >> Sometimes cloud says,\n[48:28] >> yeah. So, so cloud will say I made a\n[48:30] change to this file. Let me run the\n[48:31] tests or let me let me run this. This is\n[48:34] like agent shell instructions, right?\n[48:36] This is like part of cloud code's magic\n[48:38] sauce. It just it just says like you do\n[48:41] this then you do that. You run this\n[48:43] tool. You connect to the IDE and look\n[48:45] for the problem. If you go to Visual\n[48:47] Studio Code, you can see problems and\n[48:49] say file. Exactly.\n[48:51] >> Yeah. Language servers integrations and\n[48:53] so on. So this is agent cell. This is ID\n[48:55] context. This is what makes a coding\n[48:57] agent good at what it does by by\n[49:00] surfacing the information in small bits\n[49:03] right when it's needed. Um,\n[49:05] >> yeah, it's it's it's it's such an\n[49:07] incredible technology, isn't it? It's so\n[49:10] incredible.\n[49:11] >> And and so what I wanted to give you an\n[49:13] example of where I think it's obvious\n[49:16] that cloud will not be good at doing\n[49:19] things with Terraform compared to AWS\n[49:21] CDK.\n[49:22] >> Okay, juicy. I had the requirement\n[49:28] a theory to set up swap files for nodes\n[49:32] because we wanted to allow bursting. You\n[49:34] know, you can overshare resources on a\n[49:36] node and we wanted sometimes resources\n[49:40] to be overs subscribed and some services\n[49:43] to basically burst out and take more\n[49:45] memory than the node has. So we wanted\n[49:47] to alleviate some of the pressure by\n[49:49] creating a swap file on disk. So I asked\n[49:52] cloud to help me prepare the launch\n[49:54] templates for the autoscaling group. And\n[49:56] this was pure terapform, no AWS CDK. And\n[50:00] to do the swap file configuration, you\n[50:02] have to define the swappiness on the\n[50:05] task definition. But on Terraform, the\n[50:07] task definition is a massive JSON blob,\n[50:09] right?\n[50:10] >> It's just a massive JSON definition. And\n[50:12] cloud can do like the first level of of\n[50:15] of um of attributes of this JSON\n[50:19] definition. it it can do it decently,\n[50:21] but it when I mention about swappiness,\n[50:24] it also just put the attribute\n[50:25] swappiness straight on like the the top\n[50:27] level as an attribute as a field on a\n[50:29] JSON document and it didn't work. Uh or\n[50:32] it looked like it worked. It didn't give\n[50:33] me any errors, right? But when I looked\n[50:35] into it, it actually didn't work. And I\n[50:37] had to look really deep into AWS docs to\n[50:39] figure out that swappiness was not a top\n[50:41] level field, but was nested within\n[50:43] something called kernel attributes or\n[50:45] something like that. So on the ECS task\n[50:47] definition, you had to create a field\n[50:49] called kernel attributes. I'm not sure\n[50:51] I'm just making that up, but it was\n[50:52] something like that.\n[50:54] >> And then there was a field under there\n[50:55] called swappiness that you had to set to\n[50:57] like a certain value to actually take\n[50:59] effect. Now both the AWS API did not\n[51:02] throw an error because it just ignored\n[51:03] any unknown fields and and cloud did not\n[51:06] know what was wrong because it's just\n[51:09] it's just a JSON blob. But if I look at\n[51:11] AWS CDK, they actually exploded this\n[51:15] this this into a construct. They created\n[51:18] a task definition construct and every\n[51:20] possible field um is properly structured\n[51:23] in a TypeScript interface. So if you put\n[51:25] swappiness of the top level, you get a\n[51:27] TypeScript error that doesn't compile.\n[51:29] >> Yeah, but that but but you're assuming\n[51:31] that someone's done the work in the CDK\n[51:34] band. And that's the craziness about the\n[51:36] AWS CDK is that somebody has been doing\n[51:39] the work for 10 years and it's likeund\n[51:41] contributors and it's spread across\n[51:43] >> but that could work against you. They\n[51:45] might not have been well maintained and\n[51:48] you can't set\n[51:49] >> well that's why a framework like that\n[51:51] needs to be backed by the cloud\n[51:52] provider. This only works on AWS CDK\n[51:55] because AWS invests resources into\n[51:57] building this library. And that's why\n[51:58] AWS CDK is much more powerful than\n[52:00] Terraform because it's backed by AWS and\n[52:02] fine-tuned for its cloud.\n[52:06] >> And\n[52:08] that's what they use internally is what\n[52:10] we\n[52:11] >> exactly because when I look at the pull\n[52:12] requests, they're like, I'm at a service\n[52:14] team of AWS and we need this, you know,\n[52:17] this particular EC2 or task definition\n[52:20] field needs to be made available. On the\n[52:22] topic of CDK, um, let me just share my,\n[52:26] uh, thing again. I had a question for\n[52:29] you on operational flexibility\n[52:36] or operational features.\n[52:39] Okay. So, so here's an example. Uh I'm\n[52:43] I'm maintaining u let's just call it an\n[52:46] airflow an AWS ma MWAA airflow instance\n[52:50] at work and it's getting overloaded. I\n[52:54] need to scale it up quickly. So in\n[52:56] terraform\n[52:57] if I was man if I was managing airflow\n[52:59] in terraform I would set the CPU type\n[53:03] from\n[53:05] I don't know T1 to T5 or something M1 to\n[53:09] M5 or something right and then I do then\n[53:13] I do a plan and then I do apply and I\n[53:16] don't know half an hour later the\n[53:18] instance of airflow would have been\n[53:20] updated\n[53:22] in AWS CDK land\n[53:25] Um, again, I don't think it's any\n[53:27] faster, right? You you would still have\n[53:30] to go into your CDK code, change of\n[53:34] change something, and then do a CDK\n[53:36] deploy, and it's probably the the same\n[53:39] amount of time as the Terraform plan and\n[53:41] apply. Right?\n[53:43] What I'm trying to say here is that is\n[53:46] that is there\n[53:48] um what's the quickest way to make a\n[53:50] quick change in of these technologies\n[53:54] besides don't say click ops I mean yeah\n[53:56] I I think click ops is probably the\n[53:58] fastest you know what I mean the speed\n[54:01] to make a change\n[54:03] >> I don't think we captured it very well\n[54:08] >> um\n[54:10] yeah I\n[54:12] It's a trade-off, right, that you you I\n[54:15] it's all or nothing in these frameworks,\n[54:17] right? You either go all in and you make\n[54:20] single source of truth, Terraform, and\n[54:22] there's no way of making a change\n[54:24] outside of Terraform. Um or you\n[54:28] completely ignore that attribute in\n[54:30] terapform and then people can change it\n[54:32] and Terraform will not complain or try\n[54:34] to revert it. You know, you can say life\n[54:36] cycle ignore this attribute so try to\n[54:40] reset it. Um that's where other\n[54:43] frameworks recently try to improve\n[54:46] because they say by nature the cloud is\n[54:48] birectional. It's not one way. You know\n[54:52] forcing your infrastructure as code to\n[54:54] be single direction single sort of truth\n[54:57] in practice doesn't work. It slows teams\n[55:00] down and that's where config that all of\n[55:03] what I just said is basically from a\n[55:04] block um series from Brian Grant, right?\n[55:08] the guy who who then announced uh Config\n[55:10] Hub. So, their idea is that you must be\n[55:13] able to go into your config store and\n[55:16] change a value and have it applied\n[55:17] quickly without going through a massive\n[55:21] um and slow uh process. But that's a\n[55:25] trade-off, right? I mean their point is\n[55:28] that if you do it through our system I\n[55:30] guess there's more tracing and more\n[55:32] control over it than if somebody goes in\n[55:33] click ops at least as the config field\n[55:35] is stored inside the data and you can\n[55:37] have an audit trails there. I don't know\n[55:40] I do feel you get you can you know have\n[55:43] your cloud trail\n[55:45] events siphoned off to just note what\n[55:50] infrastructure changes they are.\n[55:53] >> Yeah. Um so system initiative they also\n[55:56] have this idea of we are a digital twin\n[55:59] and we synchronize whatever you do in\n[56:01] AWS back\n[56:03] >> I need I need to give assistive\n[56:05] system initiative a trial before I meet\n[56:08] up go meet up with\n[56:11] >> they have great ideas I mean the people\n[56:13] behind it have a lot of experience with\n[56:14] chef and puppet and there some of the\n[56:17] you know original creators of some of\n[56:19] the ideas of how chef originally worked\n[56:22] and they carried over after working with\n[56:24] Terafhone for a long time and and they\n[56:26] they they just built a new idea and the\n[56:30] way I understood from his podcast that I\n[56:33] I listen was that system system\n[56:35] initiative is a programmable graph. So\n[56:37] you create nodes and every node in the\n[56:42] graph has hooks like create, read,\n[56:45] update, delete and those notes those\n[56:48] hooks are all programmable. So you can\n[56:50] decide this node\n[56:54] It doesn't. Yeah. This node if it gets\n[56:56] created, this is how the function runs.\n[56:58] And this node if it needs to be updated,\n[57:00] this is what function it runs. And you\n[57:03] can therefore build your own nodes. It's\n[57:05] kind of like terapform provider\n[57:07] resources, right? But all split out into\n[57:09] individual node because a terapform\n[57:11] provider resource has create, read,\n[57:13] update, delete hooks, right? And the\n[57:15] telephone provider just looks at the\n[57:17] graph, determines that note needs to be\n[57:20] updated and then calls the update hook\n[57:22] for that resource and gives it the um\n[57:25] you know the actual values and and the\n[57:27] the new values and then that resource as\n[57:30] part of the provider will apply those\n[57:32] changes by making the correct AWS API\n[57:34] calls. Right? So they they kind of take\n[57:36] this terapform provider but they split\n[57:39] it out into individual programmable\n[57:41] nodes and then they they reimplemented\n[57:44] each of those nodes. What I don't like\n[57:46] as far as I understand is that under the\n[57:49] hood every single function of those\n[57:52] nodes is like using AWS CLI commands. So\n[57:56] it doesn't like it\n[57:58] >> and and\n[58:00] I don't know because honestly if you I\n[58:03] think they spent four years rebuilding\n[58:04] Terraform provider AWS by defining every\n[58:07] resource type as a node and giving it\n[58:08] create read update scripts you've only\n[58:12] done the very basic foundation because\n[58:15] what really makes infrastructure as code\n[58:17] powerful is like what I just told you 10\n[58:19] years of AWS CDK and hundreds of\n[58:20] contributors splitting out every\n[58:22] possible field and building integration\n[58:24] pattern.\n[58:26] Right?\n[58:27] Imagine you spend four years\n[58:29] re-implementing Terraform providers and\n[58:31] offering it as a solution and you\n[58:33] haven't even gotten to the level of like\n[58:35] now I have a lambda and a gateway and I\n[58:37] need to integrate them and that means I\n[58:38] need to call all of these resources and\n[58:40] I need to call all of these hooks in\n[58:42] sequence. You're you've you\n[58:44] >> Yeah. But the\n[58:46] but in a in an in a in a in an ideal\n[58:51] world the AWS CLI should be exposing\n[58:55] these things should be exposing even\n[58:58] these high level obstructions in some\n[59:00] ways the AWS CLI\n[59:03] um I mean I'm just playing devil's\n[59:05] advocate here\n[59:08] >> the CLI should be should be actually the\n[59:11] interface\n[59:13] should be enough is what I'm trying to\n[59:15] say.\n[59:16] >> Yeah. So, I haven't played enough with\n[59:18] system initiative, but I can imagine\n[59:21] that based on what he says, if they\n[59:24] started from scratch, it would take an\n[59:26] immense amount of work to reach anything\n[59:28] like AWS CDK level of UX\n[59:31] >> or DevX developer experience. And sure\n[59:34] you can show a demo which he says we you\n[59:37] know we have a demo where you give us\n[59:39] your AWS account and we point system\n[59:41] initiative and it at it and it will very\n[59:44] quickly create your AWS account\n[59:46] resources as a digital twin in our graph\n[59:48] our programmable graph and you can\n[59:50] immediately start modifying them through\n[59:53] our interface with our digital twin\n[59:55] technology but that doesn't talk about I\n[59:59] am a devop developer and I need to\n[1:00:01] deploy nextgs\n[1:00:03] And I don't care how to set up API\n[1:00:06] gateway and every single lambda so that\n[1:00:07] nextgs has a server side and can execute\n[1:00:11] right because that is what a developer\n[1:00:12] wants to do. This is the actual\n[1:00:14] functionality like I started Terraform\n[1:00:16] sorry I started my career you know\n[1:00:18] understanding how the control plane\n[1:00:20] works how reconciliation loops works but\n[1:00:23] if you work for an organization\n[1:00:26] nobody cares right we need to deploy the\n[1:00:28] feature and what is the best\n[1:00:30] architecture for us to deploy it I don't\n[1:00:31] care how kubernetes you know atcd needs\n[1:00:34] to be set up and backup procedures and\n[1:00:36] all that you want to write code\n[1:00:39] >> yeah I I that is the business value\n[1:00:41] unless you're you're a hosted kubernetes\n[1:00:43] this cluster provider as a DevOps\n[1:00:46] engineer you're coming in and only\n[1:00:47] knowing how to set up clusters you don't\n[1:00:49] bring any value unless you can do these\n[1:00:51] high level integration patterns and\n[1:00:53] after you know it was very interesting\n[1:00:55] for me but after doing it for five or\n[1:00:57] six years I wanted to actually be\n[1:00:59] valuable [laughter] you know actually\n[1:01:02] focus on these hard\n[1:01:04] level integration patterns as you'll as\n[1:01:07] you\n[1:01:08] are only really possible with CDK right\n[1:01:11] Mhm.\n[1:01:13] >> Yeah. So I CDK is great but there\n[1:01:18] obviously I think other approaches like\n[1:01:20] Pulumi they I was very surprised because\n[1:01:25] CDK has this as as I just explained it\n[1:01:27] has like these amazing deep level\n[1:01:29] integrations within the AWS services. So\n[1:01:32] if you take a TypeScript object uh for\n[1:01:34] that represents an API gateway, it gives\n[1:01:36] you a method to to like bind it to a\n[1:01:39] lambda and it knows exactly what to do\n[1:01:40] under the hood. Um Palumi is kind of\n[1:01:44] like starting from scratch and then\n[1:01:46] build little like helper methods on top.\n[1:01:49] For example, the bucket object that you\n[1:01:51] get within Palumi has the ID of like an\n[1:01:54] onevent\n[1:01:56] um hook and and you can put the function\n[1:01:59] handler in that onevent.\n[1:02:01] Uh it's on the bucket object. You should\n[1:02:03] search for bucket.onvent.\n[1:02:06] And apparently that's not in their like\n[1:02:08] L1s but also in in their like higher\n[1:02:12] level on event. Yeah, I see it's in Pumi\n[1:02:17] crosswalks. So, so AWS CDK is like the\n[1:02:21] the L2, right? And Crosswalks is like\n[1:02:23] their version of L2. It's like you take\n[1:02:26] the low-level bucket API object and then\n[1:02:29] you add ideas on top of like do onevent\n[1:02:31] and and that's a really neat little\n[1:02:33] thing. But again it required somebody at\n[1:02:35] pulley to implement the idea of a bucket\n[1:02:38] a cloudatch rule an SNS topic have this\n[1:02:41] idea of invoking a function and does\n[1:02:44] they rep they they created a repeatable\n[1:02:46] pattern that on event you pack in you\n[1:02:48] pass in the function handler and it will\n[1:02:50] automatically create the bucket create\n[1:02:52] the lambda create the bucket\n[1:02:54] notification that calls the lambda set\n[1:02:55] up the lambda permissions everything for\n[1:02:57] you right and then the only event is\n[1:03:00] like this this um this pattern that they\n[1:03:03] expose it's an interface because it's a\n[1:03:05] programming language. So you can\n[1:03:06] reimplement it. If you have something of\n[1:03:08] your own that you want to implement the\n[1:03:09] on event then you can implement exactly\n[1:03:11] what are the grant permissions that need\n[1:03:13] to be added to the policy. So you can\n[1:03:15] implement your own on event. So that's\n[1:03:17] the the the benefit of using a\n[1:03:19] programming language. You can create an\n[1:03:20] interface. You can define a contract.\n[1:03:22] You can't do that with terapform\n[1:03:24] modules. Can you try to think about\n[1:03:25] doing that with terapform modules?\n[1:03:30] Well, and I'm and going back to your IM\n[1:03:33] example\n[1:03:36] to achieve these these priv privileges\n[1:03:38] without some sort of dynamism is going\n[1:03:42] to be hard.\n[1:03:43] >> Yeah, that's exactly because of you have\n[1:03:44] this like synthesis time, lazy\n[1:03:47] evaluation, late binding, setting\n[1:03:49] properties after the program has\n[1:03:51] executed.\n[1:03:52] >> But I can't think this cuts both ways. I\n[1:03:54] mean\n[1:03:58] [sighs and gasps]\n[1:03:59] there surely there's an argu there's an\n[1:04:01] argument\n[1:04:02] >> policy that you want to to attach\n[1:04:04] >> there's there's an argument to be made\n[1:04:05] is like as soon as someone starts\n[1:04:07] writing a whole bunch of code with with\n[1:04:12] like onvent uh logic it's going to get\n[1:04:15] pretty probably quite difficult to\n[1:04:17] follow right the beauty of opening up a\n[1:04:20] lot of terraform projects is that you\n[1:04:23] kind of know what's what's happening and\n[1:04:25] it's kind of it's constrained by by the\n[1:04:29] by the language right if if like just\n[1:04:33] like any code in the world if people can\n[1:04:36] do things they will and it will just get\n[1:04:38] complex without any\n[1:04:40] >> uh yes without any uh abandon right\n[1:04:43] >> I just got the question to the today\n[1:04:45] from someone he says like do you think\n[1:04:47] that it makes sense to target an\n[1:04:49] intermediate DSL and and when you're\n[1:04:52] saying what you're saying just now it's\n[1:04:53] Like with the terra constructs, if you\n[1:04:55] do this complicated coupling uh of of\n[1:04:58] creating a lambda in an API gateway\n[1:05:00] ultimately when you run synth you get a\n[1:05:03] flat config file which is the DSL that\n[1:05:05] is terraform and you can run your\n[1:05:08] whatever um you know llinters and\n[1:05:12] problems but it's probably going to be\n[1:05:14] fishly complex but yeah okay\n[1:05:17] >> yeah because the cloud is complex dude\n[1:05:21] >> this was I Um the trade-off is you're\n[1:05:25] getting\n[1:05:27] capabilities,\n[1:05:28] elasticity\n[1:05:30] and uptime for services to move fast in\n[1:05:35] terms of a business value and does it\n[1:05:38] end up being complex? What's the\n[1:05:40] alternative? You're going to spin up an\n[1:05:42] EC2 instance and build your own and then\n[1:05:44] you know yeah on it there's different\n[1:05:47] way there's different ways of looking at\n[1:05:49] it like\n[1:05:54] you know, the more I need to give system\n[1:05:56] initiative a bit of a whirl to be\n[1:05:58] honest,\n[1:05:59] >> but I'm I'm start I'm but like I'm I'm\n[1:06:04] my I'm working backwards from AI\n[1:06:07] and I feel with AI it's about uh I mean\n[1:06:12] it's also it's also about the same thing\n[1:06:14] for humans really it's about iteration\n[1:06:16] speed and uh\n[1:06:19] >> and a to and a and a tool full chain\n[1:06:21] like I'm just thinking aloud that like\n[1:06:23] maybe calling AWS CLI from from Claude\n[1:06:29] uh you know something where system\n[1:06:31] initiative does behind the behind the\n[1:06:33] scenes is perhaps not a terrible way of\n[1:06:36] uh bootstrapping an account right to\n[1:06:40] what it needs to do for for for\n[1:06:43] a you know a typical a typical\n[1:06:47] organization and let's take a step back\n[1:06:50] what you just said about iteration and\n[1:06:53] achieving results quickly. Um, it's kind\n[1:06:57] of like how how I was understanding what\n[1:06:58] you're saying. I think this is also\n[1:07:00] related to people like originally people\n[1:07:02] were like, \"Oh, Kubernetes is going to\n[1:07:03] give me this full cloud independence.\n[1:07:06] I'm going to be able to do multicloud,\n[1:07:07] you know, as a resilience strategy and\n[1:07:09] and and everything, right?\" Very quickly\n[1:07:12] that breaks down because the advantage\n[1:07:14] of being in a cloud is to maximize its\n[1:07:17] capabilities. Like if you are an AI team\n[1:07:20] and you need to set up like this complex\n[1:07:23] um data ETL pipeline, but you need to be\n[1:07:26] completely cloud independent and you\n[1:07:29] need to do everything yourself versus oh\n[1:07:33] I'm going to use some step functions or\n[1:07:35] durable lambdas now and I'm going to\n[1:07:37] leverage all of the serverless\n[1:07:39] capabilities and I've got something\n[1:07:40] working you know because you have like\n[1:07:43] DBOS you just define your your\n[1:07:45] programming and then under the hood\n[1:07:47] whenever a function is called, it can be\n[1:07:49] suspended and it can be persisted and I\n[1:07:53] don't need to worry about exactly how\n[1:07:54] all of that works. I can just focus pure\n[1:07:56] on my business flow and it's a neat\n[1:07:59] clear data pipeline and under the hood\n[1:08:01] it's it's automatically creating lambdas\n[1:08:03] and they are being suspended when\n[1:08:05] they're waiting for events and they're\n[1:08:07] resumable and it's taking care of of of\n[1:08:10] um making sure that the event is\n[1:08:11] propagated and no notifications are\n[1:08:13] being missed and and all of this like\n[1:08:15] fall torren and and and re repeat and\n[1:08:18] that that letter Q setup and all of this\n[1:08:20] complexity gets handled by a cloud layer\n[1:08:22] and that gives you the ability to move\n[1:08:24] forward and to deliver a feature that's\n[1:08:28] between in in an organization\n[1:08:30] that's between being the market layer or\n[1:08:33] being leader of being out of out of the\n[1:08:35] market and closing down.\n[1:08:40] >> I worked in many organizations.\n[1:08:42] >> Well, okay. Just to replay my\n[1:08:44] understanding what you just said is that\n[1:08:46] like if you don't uh\n[1:08:50] get fine if if you don't\n[1:08:53] get\n[1:08:54] >> realize\n[1:08:55] >> get down in the weeds then you're not\n[1:08:56] really innovating type is what I is what\n[1:08:59] I heard.\n[1:09:00] >> It's more about if you what is what\n[1:09:04] business are you delivering? What is\n[1:09:05] your core business right? your core\n[1:09:07] business is not creating a perfect ECS\n[1:09:09] cluster and and taking care exactly of\n[1:09:11] like setting up um pipeline that that\n[1:09:15] does exactly one delivery of all the\n[1:09:16] messages and and does does all of this\n[1:09:18] core like engineering most organizations\n[1:09:22] just need to deliver business value or\n[1:09:23] they're or they they die\n[1:09:25] >> they're out of business. Yeah. And then\n[1:09:26] you\n[1:09:28] >> I think you made the argument that like\n[1:09:30] you can't do this in the CLI. You need\n[1:09:32] to you need to get down into the the\n[1:09:34] details. I mean sorry if I My link back\n[1:09:37] to to what you were saying earlier about\n[1:09:40] um\n[1:09:42] my link back was basically\n[1:09:45] maximizing highle services of cloud\n[1:09:48] without\n[1:09:51] um\n[1:09:53] worrying about it not being reproducible\n[1:09:55] or um yeah I don't know I I I had a\n[1:09:59] point\n[1:09:59] >> okay we we I sorry I I my kids uh need\n[1:10:03] to be taken to school so I ran out of I\n[1:10:06] sound like I have a point just now. I\n[1:10:08] need to rewatch this to remember what my\n[1:10:09] point is.\n[1:10:10] >> Okay,\n[1:10:11] >> I'll put it in the comments.\n[1:10:12] >> We'll we'll get to the point. Thanks for\n[1:10:14] watching if you're watching this. Bye.",

Terraform isn't enough for AWS.\n</context>\n\n<content>\nTranscript:\nWelcome to episode 12 of the AI\nInfrastructure Podcast with me, Kai\nHendry in the UK and Vincent Smith over\nin Vietnam. In this episode, we talk\nabout CDKTF.\nAnd long story short, we try to\nrationalize where CDKTF fits in in light\nof the recent deprecation by Hashi Corp/\nIBM.\nAnd\nwe we do justify CDK. Uh well, let me\ngive you a summary why we think CDK is\nimportant.\nIt's a high level abstraction\nand it allows complicated cloud\ninfrastructure to be reasoned about.\nIt allows you to get the most out of the\ncloud to differentiate.\nAnd if you just think conversely perhaps\nif you got if you vibe coded your\ninfrastructure using I don't know AWS\nCLI or something you just couldn't get\nuh\na solid reproducible deterministic\ninfrastructure that way you need higher\nlevel constructs uh that the AWS CDK\nsort of provide you. So\nyou ideally need to work with it. So in\nlight of the deprecation of of IBM that\nwe need to find a place for for CDK a\nprogramming language in order to do the\nnext level stuff with the cloud and\ninfrastructure. So enjoy the episode.\nPlease uh\nif if CDKTF doesn't uh tickle your\nfancy, check out the other stuff in the\nplaylist and have a merry Christmas. See\nyou. Goodbye.\nYeah, this guy. Which which guy?\n>> So, since CDKTF was sunset by IBM and I\ncreated a fork under a project that I\nbuilt a bunch of CDKF\nL2 constructs. There's one guy who's\nbeen contributing three PRs over\nwell so far he's contributed I think\nseven PRs already and I merged six and\nhe keeps adding cool stuff. It's\namazing.\n>> Yeah. So you just forked it and and\n>> No, no, no. He contributes.\n[clears throat]\nSo the one that I forked, I put it on\npause, right? We're waiting for a go-\nahead. Um we're collaborating with the\nOpen Construct Foundation which um hosts\nseveral of the\nyou know CDK related projects and we're\ntrying to find a final and good name. Um\nhopefully we don't have to rename but I\nsincere I seriously doubt that Hashi\nCorp is going to allow us to use the\noriginal CDKTF package names. So we'll\nprobably have to rename it. And I\nrenamed the TCON which is Terra\nConstructs. It's a four-letter acronym\nand people obviously don't like that.\nTCON sounds familiar now. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Terra Constructs is the library\nthat I built.\n>> Oh okay.\n>> Yeah. So tons is is what I you know it's\na scope that I have on npmgs. So I use\nit for a lot of stuff. So I was like,\n\"Yeah, I'm just going to reuse I just\ntook immediate action, right? Fork it\nand rename it to my stuff and then\n[snorts]\n>> then um\n>> yeah, so it it pushed my project in the\nforeground and we're holding on the fork\nbecause we don't have the final name and\nI agree maybe we don't call it TCON, but\nat the same time somebody else took\nnotice of my other project and has\ncontributed about eight PRs to it and\nthey are all high quality.\n>> Can you show me? Can you get give me a\nlink? I just I'm just curious to see\nwhat what what what you what what this\ncontribution is. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Uh\nit's on my\nhere.\nI have to get used to this um thing\njumping around. Hold on.\n>> But you mean your Arch Linux C?\n>> Yeah, I use I use Arch by the way.\nIt's never going to get old. Going to\nkeep saying it. Okay. I send it on Zoom.\n>> Yeah. Like Primagin says a lot. Does he?\n>> Does he just We're just following other\nYouTubers. So sad.\n[snorts] Uh\n>> no. But then then I have to start\nwhining like Teo.\n>> Shots fired.\n>> I'm already doing a job whining. Right.\nOne complaint that I get from my YouTube\nchannel is that like, Kai, yeah, I like\nyour content, but you you you complain\ntoo much, so I can't watch you. It's\nlike, what do I am I that guy?\nUh,\nokay. Refactor, use AWS CDK. Oh, hold\non. Let me see if I can sh my screen.\nI've been digging into that PR because\nit actually enables really cool stuff.\nSo basically a little bit of background.\nAWS CDK has this regional information\nlibrary\nthat keeps it track of like which\ncapabilities are available across the\nregions. They download a fact table like\nuh lambda runtime support for NodeJS\nlatest is version 22 in China or\ngovernment region for example but it's\nversion 24 for other regions where\nNodeJS version 24 has already been\ndeployed right it takes time for this\nstuff to deploy\n>> so [clears throat]\nother stuff is like uh S3 bucket\nendpoints or like the domain suffix of\nan S3 uh original endpoint point, right?\nThe URL suffix that um they changed the\nway that that S3 works over the years.\nSo new regions, they use a different\nsuffix.\n>> So the you know, I think I noticed that.\n>> Yeah. So the AWS CDK has logic in it\nthat uses a fact table about the regions\nto figure out how to build a a bucket or\nlike if you give it a a bucket URL or\njust a bucket name and and it's it has a\nit has a regional like your AWS CDK\nstack has a region. So then it uses that\ninformation to find out yeah what's\ngoing to be the domain URL for that\nbucket depending on the region. So I had\ncopied that over. I had copied over the\nfact table into my code because I didn't\nknow it was a separate package. And he\nsays, \"Well, you know, we don't have to\ncopy over the details. We can just reuse\nthe AWS CDK package on top of CDKTF.\"\n>> Cool. This actually looks like a pretty\ngood contribution. Holy moly. I'm I'm\n>> Oh yeah, dude. All of his contributions\nhave been absolute fire. The only thing\nis he doesn't write integration tests.\nSo every single one of them I I check\nout and I um I I build an integration\ntest and I validate that you can\nactually terraform deploy it into AWS\nand doesn't get any errors. Yeah. But\nhe's been he's been aligning Terra\nconstructs closely to AWS CDK.\n>> Cool.\nSo I got a couple of maybe noob\nquestions for you but like I guess this\nmight serve the audience.\nSo\nCDK for Terraform\nbasically allow people to write in that\nfamiliar CDK style which was\nwhich was like which came out of\n>> AWS\n>> AWS uh what's his name? Ben Ben Israel\nright that guy\n>> not Ben Israel\n>> um who was it again?\nIs it worth mentioning her name?\nWho? What? Sorry.\n>> Who who who was the guy that was in the\noriginal team that he left and he he did\ndid Wing Wing Lang?\n>> Yeah. Elot Ben Israel. Uh Elot Ben\nIsrael.\n>> Oh, I I wasn't wrong with the name.\nOkay. Sorry.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> I thought I was making up the his name\nor something. So, CDK\ncool beans. I think we went through\nyesterday that it was like the the thing\nthat really makes it different is that\nis that it's operationally\nuh friendly. You can refactor this the\nstuff\nand it's a programming language un\nunlike maybe Terraform and things like\nthat. Now the thing that I don't\nunderstand is how it links up with\nTerraform. A and B\nwhat did actually CDK for Terraform\nactually provide? Did they provide\neverything that that uh Terraform\nproviders did or was it a subset?\nOkay. So\nthe cloud development toolkit CDK from\nAWS com is built upon and they've split\nthis out like some composible\num ideas. So one of them is the concept\nof constructs. Constructs are basically\nobjects that\nknow how to synthesize or write themsel\nout into like a small little snippet of\nconfiguration,\n>> right? If you use if you use a con and\nthey are able to be composed into trees\nof constructs so you can nest constructs\ninto other constructs and so\n>> yeah don't people sometimes call them\n>> oh is my webcam just stopped don't don't\nsome people call them like stages or\nsomething like that\n>> no stages is something else I think it's\num if you are doing like cloud for\ndeployment across different\nenvironments. I think you can define\nstages,\n>> okay,\n>> to like duplicate stacks. I I mean I I\nknow that CDK pipelines uses stages. I\nknow that there's a concept of stages\nwithin AWS CDK, but the thing is\nfirst AWS CDK was built within AWS.\nRight.\n>> Right.\n>> They had a couple of crucial innovations\nin terms of infrastructure as code. The\nfirst one is a tree,\na composition of configuration that\nstarts at the root note which is usually\nyour app, your entry point and from\nthere on you tie like a tree of\nconstructs and when you and each one of\nthem have a little bit of configuration\nlike information so they know how to\nsynthesize out into a configuration\ntarget language. So if you use AWS CDK,\nthe constructs that you need are the\napp, the AWS CDK app,\n>> that synthesizes itself down to a cloud\nfor stack,\n>> right?\n>> And then each construct that you put\ninside those apps\num will be a cloud for resource, right?\nBecause within a stack you use cloud\nform resources, right?\n>> Right.\n>> And now if you apply those ideas on top\nof Terraform,\n>> right? So when when they port over the\nthe app, it's basically something that\nrepresents a single terraform\nuh root module, right? If you talk about\nterraform modu um nomenclature or or\nconcepts\n>> terminologies.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. If you if you basically have\na directory and you drop in a config\nfile and then you run Terraform in it,\nit will consider that directory as the\nroot module, right? And then if you\ncreate another directory and you put in\nsome config there and then you include\nthat directory as a module that will be\nlike a sub module right. So in terapform\nconstructs are kind of like directories\nof configuration files and you you um\nsource them into like module source and\nthen you can nest those modules as well.\nBut the one that is the actual um\nyou know app entry point is the root\nmodule of your directory. Right? When\nterraform runs, it will find the\nterapform configurations in your\ndirectly sibling files and aggregate\neverything into a single config in\nmemory, right? Both HCL, which is a\nseparate set of JSON and some JSON if\nyou want. And then it will create in\nmemory your Terraform configuration.\nAnd then within that root module, you\nmay refer to other modules that are\ncoming from either\n>> it does it write it out as normal\nTerraform. So you can inspect the\nTerraform.\n>> Yeah. So the the whole greatness of CDK\nfor Terraform is that ultimately what\nyou get once you synthesize or serialize\nthat construct tree down to the target\nlanguage you get pure and raw Terraform\n>> and is is it is it readable or is it\nlike\n>> it is\n>> nonsense?\n>> It's very readable. Uh there's a couple\nof things that may you know make people\nupset because in the construct tree\num the identity of a resource like if\nyou write terraform you're going to say\num AWS\ninstance and then you give it a name\nlike uh web and then you put in the\nconfig attributes such as VPC ID\ninstance type imi like what's the image\nthat needs to be provided right so the\nname right AWS instance And then you\nhave the name web in when you serialize\nfrom from TypeScript down into that\nconfig.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Kind of flattens everything. So it it\ndoes some type of unique ID generation.\n>> That's a good thing though. I thought we\nwe we discussed that.\n>> No, it it's it creates an unique logical\nID. So that resource it's not your\nphysical ID because in in any case when\nyou create an instance in AWS your\nphysical ID is you cannot determine it\neither, right? Not all AWS resources\nallow you to determine your physical ID.\nThe instance ID is I- blah blah blah\nblah. Your your load balancer ID is I is\nLB- something. But if you do a bucket\nand you say I want the bucket name to be\nFU, it will be exactly FU and globally\nunique. You will not get it even if\nsomebody else created a bucket fu.\nRight? [snorts]\n>> Um so so some resources they allow you\nto determine or to define your physical\nID and some [snorts] resources they\ndon't allow you and they automatically\nget an ID. But here I'm talking about\nthe logical ID, right? Even though the\nlogical ID will be something that you\nwrite in your configuration file. So if\nyou ask me like does it serialize to to\nreadable terraform, it is just the logic\nids have these weird suffixes that you\ncan actually disable if you want. You\ncan actually go and say don't give me\nthese hash suffixes, but they're used to\nmake things unique. They're used to make\nsure that the logic IDs don't have any\nconflicts. So, [snorts] so that's the\nonly thing that I think people when they\nfirst look at it kind of get annoyed by\nis like why are these names so like have\nthis weird checksum like like you know\nthis hash at the end of the name. Uh and\nthat's purely because they don't want to\nhave a conflict or an error when you\nhave like nested parts that all get\nserialized down into the root module.\n>> Um so CDKTF also supports modules\nTerraform modules by the way you can\nrefer to an existing Terapform module.\nSo it's very good for an existing team\nthat is already using terapform modules\nextensively. With CDKTF, you can take\nthat terapform module and convert it\ninto a TypeScript interface. So it reads\nthe full module definition, looks at all\nof the variables and their types\n>> and then creates an equivalent type.\n>> In my in my current client, we we we\nswitched to Terra. They they were\nthey're a CDK shop, but we but when I\njoined, we we basically set up a new\nworkflow with Terraform because of\nSnowflake.\nBut it sounds like I could have used\nCDKTF to bring in the Snowflake\nTerraform provider into into CDK world,\nright? Or to Am I misunderstanding?\nthe CDKTF provider would allow you to if\nyou so so that's one thing right you can\ncreate bindings for modules and it will\nlook at the variables that the module\ntake and then generate a typescript\ninterface or you can create bindings to\nterapform providers like the so\nsnowflake provider and yes you will get\na TypeScript interface but no it will\nnot allow you to to use it with AWS CDK\nright because AWS CDK only works with\ncloud form and the CDKTF generated one\nwill generate terraform.\n>> Yeah. Yes. So, but it Yeah.\nI mean, to be honest, I'm not a huge fan\nof all the I mean, this this this magic\nconverting different bindings of\ndifferent languages into CDK kind of\nmakes me nervous.\n>> I I want to clarify one thing, right? in\nitself\ncreating a terapform provider I mean\nreading in the terraform provider\nresources and generating TypeScript\nbindings or Python orn net or whatever\non its own has very little value\nhonestly um you just get these like L1\nconstructs and you now can call that\nconstructor and maybe the one thing that\nyou get is you're able to use like um\nlazy evaluations basically you And for\nsome attributes, you can provide a\nfunction instead of an actual value. And\nso when it synthesizes, it's going to\nexecute the function to basically decide\nwhat the value for that property needs\nto be. And that is very powerful\nalready, right? Because it means that\ndepending on how you call it, a function\ncan execute and then determine what the\nvalue for this particular attribute\ncould be. Um, for example, if you are\nwhere is this like really useful? Yeah,\nmaybe in policies, right? Let's say that\nyou you are you are building some type\nof infrastructure and you're using an IM\npolicy and you're using a bunch of other\nresources and you want the policy to be\ngenerated at the very end after the user\nhas already defined the full program and\nall of the configuration that he wants\nto be\n>> generated. Yeah, there's a lease\nprivileges type thing. M\n>> yeah the functions can be very smart and\nidentify exactly what are the actions\nthat need to be added into the policy\ndepending on what the user um you know\nconnected. So it's kind of like it's\nkind of a mixture of like an imperative\nlanguage to create a declarative\ndefinition of infrastructure as code and\nlike people are like oh you know why\nwould you do that you know is all about\ndeclarative and you you cannot do mix it\nwith imperative you start doing that\npeople will no longer like know exactly\nwhat's going on uh but if you look at\nthe language itself since uh terraform\n0.12\nyou know before it became uh stable they\nadded um list comprehensions they added\ndynamic values dynamic you know for each\nand there's a very clear reason why they\ndid that because you can't manage AWS\nresources with pure static definitions\nyou're always before that you have free\nprocessors people wrote template\nlanguages to generate terapform\nconfiguration\n>> yeah yeah I feel I feel this is a trend\nin infrastructures co in infrastructure\ngame is like\nthe days have gone where you can just\ndeclaratively put thing is in YAML,\nright? You you need\n>> you need a programming language and then\n>> you're going to keep adding layers and\nlayers of abstraction to work around\nthis this core missing feature that you\nare not working with a proper language\nprogramming language and then you start\nadding um config language.\n>> Yeah. So generators\n>> I guess in a in a very\nuh succinct way CDK gives you the binds\nto a proper programming language and\nthat's that's really what what it does\nright [clears throat]\n>> and but still I mean and then and then\nit gives you the ability to do lazy\nevaluations so late binding um so that\nyou can evaluate the full full program\nand the user can program uh imperatively\nbuild up the the configuration so he can\ntake some object that somebody else\nwrote and then invoke some methods on it\nto mutate this, you know, the the the\nobject to their liking.\n>> Like for example, in in CDK for\nKubernetes, um when you create a\ndeployment, it's going to define a pot\ntemplate and then a replica uh count\nthat how many times you want that\ntemplate to be created um to create the\npots, right? And and then you want maybe\nto set some type of anti-affffinity. So\nyou can do all of that declaratively in\nin Kubernetes and it's not a simple\nconfiguration system because to define a\npot template with anti- affinity rules\num to be fully flexible and this is also\nwhy people like compose right compose is\nsuper simple but like Kubernetes has all\nthe little dials and knobs.\n>> Sorry what's compose oh with a K. You\nmean\n>> docker compose um you know before that\nor ECS people like\n>> oh docker compose oh okay\n>> yeah I love docker compose because it\ngives you like this very simple thing\nbut if you want to do something earlier\nyou were complaining um yesterday you\nwere complaining you were saying\nverscell is great but if you want to do\nlike um custom type of database I can't\ndo it you know I need the dials and\nknobs well that's where it breaks right\nthese abstractions so the same way way\nwith compose and and and that's why\nkubernetes as like everything under the\nsun, right? You can define exactly what\nresources on the node need to be\n>> for days and crossplane.\n>> Yes. And and and and so the actual\nconfiguration you have to write becomes\nsuper complicated. Kubernetes is the\nsame thing. You end up with like\n>> what is the Yeah. So I got CDK is the\nprogramming language answer to maybe uh\nTerraform. But what is what is the\nprogramming language answer to to\nyou know Kubernetes?\nSo AWS built CDK for Kubernetes. There's\none guy Ilia, he did a lot of like he's\none of the main contributors.\nYeah, I loved it. Like initially it was\na bit frustrating because you\n>> Yeah, because one of the things you\nlearn as a Kubernetes administrator and\nif you go for certificates, which I\nnever do because I don't think they're\nworth it. Um,\n>> oh dear God, don't go there. That's a\nrabbit hole.\n>> Yeah. So\n>> is this another Ben Israel thing? Um,\nno, but it comes from within AWS, but it\napplies the same idea of of creating a\ntree of constructs and and and the same\nidea of building like the core\nKubernetes API objects which are pod\ndeployment, replica set, um, service and\nall of these, right? And now he's doing\nrobotics.\n>> Anyway, so Ilia is one of the guys that\nlike I see contribute and react and\nstill maintain this project mostly. I'm\nsure there's other people working on it.\nBut the greatest thing here is\n>> the moment you have built those core API\nobjects, you can still write this, you\nknow, create your Kubernetes\nconfiguration, but it's honestly worse\nworse than YAML because you have all\nthese additional curly braces and very\nnested like complicated configuration.\nSo pure L1 constructs, this pure\nlanguage binding are not very useful.\nBut what's immensely useful when you\nwork with CDK for Kubernetes is that\nthey built these higher level ideas of\nlike we're going to grab this low-level\nAPI object that's called a deployment\nand we're going to add a scheduling\nnamespace and we're going to add the\nidea of spreading pods on the scheduling\nnamespace and suddenly you are defining\nlike I want to spread this across nodes\nand there you basically you go like my\ndeployment.spread spread dot uh sorry my\ndeployment.sccheduling.spread\nspread as a method. Your intention is to\nspread these pots. That's your\nintention, right? And that gets\ntranslated into a declaration, an actual\nrule.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> the affinity\n>> these convenient Yeah, that sounds like\na good useful abstraction.\n>> Plus,\n>> so what what abstractions?\n>> Oh, plus, sorry. Yeah, plus is is the\nthe the the real power because that's\nwhere they they create these high level\nlike deployment and chron job and and\nthen you and they make service and and\nthen they have like reasonable defaults.\nSo with very few lines of code it's kind\nof like Helm, right? But Helm is\ndeclarative like YAML config files with\nno schema. So you don't get\nIntelliSense. you don't know exactly\nlike where do I need to put this\nconfiguration for it to end up where it\nneeds to be because YAML helm doesn't\nhave any schemas and even in later\nversions they try to add schemas but it\ndoesn't really work.\n>> So have you have you used this\nproduction or you just checked it out?\n>> No I I I I\nwas at an organization that had\neverything under the sun. They had helm\nthey had JSONet they had customized they\nhad\n>> Oh my god.\n>> Yeah. They had everything.\n>> And did you introduce something new\nwhile you were there? Of course, I I I\nbuilt a new standard, but I [laughter]\ndid more than that. I did not just add a\nnew standard. I actually built a bunch\nof migration tools for everything else.\nSo, I I had like a very clear path like\nif this is a service that you're working\non and we we were adopting Argo CD and\nthe only way to adopt Argo CD was to\nadopt CDK for Kubernetes. So, I made it\nso that you can't go and manage your\nservice with Argo CD without\n>> I don't think we've ever really talked\nabout GitOps. Are you a GitOps? I mean,\ndo you have uh any opinions there\nquickly?\n>> Yes, I I\n>> maybe save that for another video.\nI [snorts] ran Argo CD since 2019\nand very quickly realized that a lot of\npeople like to do magic on the server\nside and they like to minimize the\nconfiguration that goes in and then they\nlike to Argo CD to like expand\neverything using Helm uh rendering like\nlast minute.\n>> Oh no no no. You want Argo CD just to be\na UI is is or\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You want Argo CD to\ntake whatever is in git and fire it\nstraight at Kubernetes. Exactly. And\nthen get back to that's that's one thing\nI I use Argo CD and ang\n>> crazy like why mix it up.\n>> Yeah. So some so they build all these\namazing customized plugins and Helm\nplugins to run on the Argo City server\nand that's the first thing I throw out\nbecause you want\n>> you and I\npattern\n>> sorry\n>> you and I are the are a little bit too\nsimilar\n>> but but you know why this is relevant\nbecause this is called the rendered\nmanifest pattern and the co and the core\ncreator of Kubernetes like one of the\nco-founders Brian Grant and one of the\nco-founder founders of of of the idea of\ngithops uh for flux with weave and you\nknow there's flux cd and there's argo cd\n>> yeah I don't yeah flux used to be a\ncontender right\n>> I think ar flux is still a contender\nthey broke it down into microser they\nmake it it's way more performant but it\ndoesn't have a fancy UI so everyone\nloves Argo CD but nobody like flux is\nstill evolving but again like I haven't\nran communities for 2 years but what I\nwanted to say is that the guys that are\nvery, you know, smart people, [laughter]\nBrian Grant and um Richardson, uh from\nWeave, they created the logical\nextension of this rendered manifest\npattern. So basically the idea of like\nyou you make sure that everything gets\nrendered down into manifest into git. So\nArgo CD can purely track a raw manifest\nand just fire it off after Kubernetes\nand then you you are able to validate\nimmediately what is the error message\nthat that Kubernetes sends back because\nit just relates directly to whatever you\nhave in git. So you can see very\nclearly. So they evolved that pattern\nand they call it config hub. So instead\nof just like having a very dumb git\ndatabase, they built a specialized\ndatabase for for for uh storing these\nconfigurations. And then the idea of\nlike um making a change, you can go\nstraight into config hub and make a a\nchange where it needs to be. So you\ndon't need to go through the git\npipeline. Um and then you can also call\nfunctions if you need to make a change\nacross\n>> I thought we thought I thought we\nestablished that changing things outside\nthe the pipeline is a bad idea.\nSo, so they turned it upside down and\nthey they provided an a config hub that\nhelps you make changes in a controlled\nway and in a repeatable way because it's\nkind of like functional programming. You\ncan register endpoints on top of your\nconfig data and then you can apply\nfunctions. So, mutate your config data\nacross your whole environment and then\nyou can do it with an approval step uh\nworkflow. So you you just select what\nyou want to affect, you apply the\nfunction, you can see a preview, and\nthen you can approve and then boom, it's\nGitOps. It gets ops in a in a in a like\nreasonable way.\n>> Have you used this product? Have you\nused this yourself?\n>> Uh no, but I um I understand the idea\nbecause a lot of what what he built\noriginally with customize, you know, the\nidea of applying JSON patches, they kind\nof like extended it as those get JSON\npatches now run as part of like ant\nhooks. haven't used it. They just made\nit like\n>> Oh, yeah. We were talking about hooks\nyesterday. What was using hooks again?\nOh my god.\n>> Oh, can do can do\n>> Yeah. Yeah. The hooks thing is\n>> in the CDK as well.\n>> This kind of a little bit different.\nHooks.\n>> Yeah. But this one in my mind\n>> I don't know if config hub can can\nmanage any other configuration except\nfor Kubernetes. This this is like firmly\nsettled in the idea of like a\nreconciliation loop and and having a\ncontrol plane that runs that constantly\nruns these reconciliation loops and\nautomatically adjust your like with\neventual consistency adjust your your\ncloud towards it. Right?\n>> So which is one thing that Terraform\ndoes not have right terraform you run an\napply and it doesn't touch it until the\nnext time you run an apply where\nKubernetes is constantly re-evaluating\nyour infrastructure and making sure that\nit is aligned. I the the one thing\nuh\n[snorts]\nwas so like let me start with the\nproblem at what we're using terraform\nuh actually this is a problem with CDK\ntoo the whole CDK deploy thing is a bit\nslow but okay never mind that\n>> that's cloudformation issues\n>> that's that's infrastructures yeah\nthat's that's cloudformation issues but\num stop me if I talked about this before\nbut one one issue that we have right now\nis that we're using uh database we're\nusing Terraform to to manage Snowflake\nand we don't want to we don't want to\ndelete the resources because that could\nlead to data loss and all\n>> stuff and we don't want to recreate\nresources. So, so I have I have like\nsome crappy\n>> worried about constantly re like\n>> Yeah, I have some crappy what do you\ncall it? You know, uh GitHub workflow\nwhere I basically inspect the plan to\nmake sure to make sure it's not deleting\nanything. But I thought to myself, come\non, there's got to be a better way\nbecause because right now we have a we\nhave a separate plan and an apply stage.\nWhy? Because we want people to do a plan\nbefore they know what they're doing\nbefore they delete things.\nUnfortunately, no one really reads the\nplan in all honesty. So, there's that\nproblem. So, so hence I have some crappy\ncode to check for for some a deletion or\na a recreate. And I just think to\nmyself, is this the way people do it? Is\nthere a better way?\nI mean, that that sort of life cycle\ntype thing kind of sucks.\nThat's my current.\n>> Yeah. And that's also why a lot of\npeople when we talk about crossplane\nthere people very um\npessimistic around it because they put\nso much um official or orchestration\naround this you know plan and apply.\nthey have a a big like ceremony around\nthe process and so something going\nbehind the scene and constantly\nreconciling kind of feels wrong to them,\nright? Uh and I think it really depends\non the maturity. If you're Google and\nyou're deploying a thousand times a day,\nyour services are reconciling and this\nis how you build your architecture. I\nguess if you I guess the there's an\nthere's an adage with when it comes to I\nmean this is probably one of the first\nthings I learned when I got into\ninfrastructure is like don't manage your\ndatabase in infrastructure is code\nyou know because because then you won't\nhave these problems like separate the\ndata\n>> so that was definitely s uh like true\nfor the longest time because stateful\nkubernetes cluster\n>> like\nmaintaining database in and I think\nthere was a Kubernetes uh controller or\nsomething where you could spin up a a\ndatabase and everyone said no this is a\nterrible idea\n>> and I and quickly caught on to why\n>> if I talk about 2016 then stateful sets\nare like just introduced.\n>> Yeah.\nAnd and so at the time the problem with\nHelm is that everyone can just pull a\nchart and go like, \"Oh, uh, Helm\ninstalled MySQL. There I go. I have\nMySQL now.\" Yes. But you know,\n>> set up a huge cluster.\n>> Yeah. What what where where is the data\nstores? Oh, so it's provisioning an EBS\nvolume. How how is the ownership of that\nEBS volume tracked? Like what if you do\nan upgrade? How do you manage? And then\npeople they built this is like you know\npets versus cattle where you're building\nyes you're creating a a cattle of nodes\nbut you're building pat kubernetes\nclusters. So so what is the the point of\npat kubernetes clusters then you need to\nstart bu using arcane or whatever it's\ncalled to to create backups of your\nclusters and your control plane. I never\nlike that idea. I always made my cluster\ncompletely stateless so that I can\nrebuild it\n>> a thermal I don't know.\n>> Yeah. So all of all of the state lives\noutside right that's how you want to\nbuild your microservices if you can\ndepending on you know what is the SLAs\nand and what is your your architecture\nthat you have to support um but if you\ncan and you can perfectly scale\nhorizontally and you keep all of your\ndata on a different tier outside of your\ncluster then that makes life so much\neasier because you can just blow away a\ncluster and rebuild it. Yeah.\n>> You can just put them side by side and\nthey can share the state outside of the\ncluster. Um and then once you start\nbuilding stateful clusters, your SLOs's\nare completely different. Your your\noperations around those clusters are\ncompletely different.\n>> Yeah. But but don't you think that like\nlike just going going back to CDK like I\nmean a lot of tooling does bring state\ninto it, doesn't it? A little bit.\nSorry about CDK and and like uh sorry to\nI'm just trying to bring it back to\nto CDK like like like doesn't CDK I\nthink we talked about it yesterday but\nlike doesn't CDK have like a strong\nconcept of context or something like\nthat and that in itself is a state isn't\nit I mean\nso on one side in these traditional\ninfrastructure as code frameworks you\nhave the concept of a state like cloud\nform keeps track of the resources it\ncreated And Terraform has a state file\nthat keeps track of the resources it\ncreated. So that it knows, you know, it\nties back those logical ids in the state\nfile to the actual physical ideas. And\nif you remove a logic ID in your\nconfiguration, it will make sure that\nthat resource is deleted. And if you\nmodify the configuration,\n>> yeah,\n>> it will make sure that the actual\nphysical ID uh resource is updated.\nRight. So\n>> it uses a state file.\n>> Yeah. So basically I'm just\nuh wiring these in my brain. I mean I'm\ncrosswiring these in my brain. Like if\nwe have infrastructure and we want to\nhave a goal of keeping separate state\nI guess maybe it should be scoped to\napplication state or something but but\nit's it's um it's not I mean if you're\nreligious about separate state it's not\nthat clear to me separate cleanly\n>> you wouldn't run a terraform controller\nin your kubernetes because that means\nyou're adding state to it or the\nterraform controller must have access to\nan external state bucket uh within the\n>> Yeah, it's got to it's got to be it's\ngot to be a very clear division, right?\n>> Yeah. So, that's a problem with\ncrossplane, right? Because where does\ncrossplane store that state tracking? It\nstores it inside the Kubernetes cluster\ncontrol plane.\n>> So, now you've created a stateful\ncontrol like control plane. You've\ncreated a stateful cluster.\n>> So, so that's where where like you know\nyou're using crossplane to bootstrap\nKubernetes and that becomes a stateful\ncluster. So you need like one Uber\ncluster that controls all the other\nclusters and that becomes your stateful\ncluster that you need to do very careful\nupgrades around operations are are\ndifferent. And of course it makes sense\nfor a company like Upbound which\nsponsors crossplane to say hey you know\nwe are your your Uber cluster we manage\nthat for you. We we provide you a\nstateful cluster. We guarantee that your\nyour control plane is backed up and can\nbe res restored and we're we're going to\ntake care of that. And that's the you\nknow the the managed service offering\nthat they provide. Um and that's why\nthey they they create something like\ncrossplane right. Um and I think Google\ncloud went the same way. They have like\nservice connect or config connect. They\nhave a service in GCP that's very\nstrongly based on of off crossplane that\nbasically you you you you define and and\nto be honest Kubernetes is already\ntaking care of a lot of your a your\ncloud resources right because when you\nsay I have a service and I need to make\nmake it externally exposed it goes and\ncreates a load balancer right so you\nalready have a cloud controller inside\nKubernetes creating um AWS resources you\nhave a controller that creates nodes to\nadd capacity to the cluster you have a\ncontroller that that um creates um\nrouting rules if you are depending on\nwhat type of uh networking that you set\nup so that your your uh routing tables\ncan route the traffic between your pots\nacross the nodes. So, Kubernetes control\nplane already modifies your cloud and\ncreates resources in the cloud. So, it\nmakes sense to extend that and also\ncreate databases and buckets and\n>> Yeah. Yeah. This is this is where things\nget look crazy to me.\n>> Yeah. I mean I I [sighs] see the point.\nI I think if you're going all in and\nyou're a big Kubernetes shop, it makes\nsense. The only biggest issue I have\nwith Kubernetes is that you have these\ndeclarative YAML that becomes super hard\nto to manage and then solutions like\nconfig hub make sense because now you\ncan define your load balancers, your\nbuckets, your databases, everything in\nconfig hub and let the reconciliation\nloop constantly. tell okay maybe let's\nturn the conversation back to AI like if\nyou were to if you were if you were to\nlike start on a green field project and\nuse Claude to to set up um\nI don't know we kind of do need to scope\nthis to some sort of example let's say\nthat we need to run um I don't know\nWordPress\nat scale you know WordPress.com\nUh, so PHP, MySQL, blah blah blah.\n[snorts] the\n>> be careful. Would you do would you do\nthat in Kub would you do that in\nKubernetes and and just let Claude\nspin up some\nuh I don't know CDK uh what did we call\nit CDK Kubernetes like what what would\ngive the best\niteration you know what would give the\nbest AI friendliness slash\niteration loop\nis what I'm thinking\nOh. Um, so this are you thinking about\nwhat type of system would be able to\nleverage AI in the me like the best way?\nYeah. Would be intuitive to the AI,\nright?\n>> Exactly. So, so the so that kind of\nassumes some the AI is sort of maybe\nkind of familiar to the workflow. I\nmean, you don't want to spend too much\ntime teaching it something new, I\nsuppose, is what I'm trying to lose.\n>> So, that's where everyone jumped on\ncreating MCP servers or or finding ways\nto to provide the LLM, the generic LLM\nthat has been trained of lots of data to\nbasically give it the right context for\nthe work that it needs to do. So, if\nyou're take a generic\n>> MCP, MCP is more for doing tool calls\nthan giving context.\nSome people seem to mix that up a bit.\n>> I think it's No, it's the difference is\ntool calls allow you to pull in context\non demand. The LLM sees a tool that says\nyou can call me to get information about\nthe weather in in London. Um, you can\ncall me.\n>> So, it's tool calls\n>> give the LLMs the arms and legs to reach\nout into the world to find information\nthat it doesn't have.\n>> So, it can do it on its own. If you if\nyou don't use tool calls, you as an\noperator of the LLM have to kind of\nfigure out everything that that LLM\nmight need to solve the problem that\nyou're trying to do, right?\n>> On the subject of tools, you know,\nKubernetes tools, cubectl is pretty\npretty awesome, isn't it?\n>> Um, so that's where things have evolved,\nright? If you if you use cloud code\nskills and you give it a high level\noverview what cubectl can be used for\nand then it goes and finds out more\ninformation about like the user has a\nproblem uh with autoscaling and I need\nto figure out if there's enough capacity\nin the cluster and then it goes off and\nuh finds the cubectl commands that you\nknow tells it how much like the top like\nnode stop for example to see how much\nCPU is being used across the cluster.\nSo, so skills are this like gradual\ndiscovery of information without\noverloading the context with every\npossible\nuh tool that the QTL exposes, right?\nbecause ultimately cubectl can be used\nin such a way that you can overload um\nwith like hundreds of tools but you you\nneed to slice it and dice it down into\nlike you know if you're working on this\nparticular problem then you might want\nto look at this set of tools uh and if\nyou want to work on that type of problem\nyou want to look at this set of tools so\nthen cloud knows like hey I'm looking at\nthis type of problem oh can can we go\nlook at those set of tools and then\nloads them in and figures out that it\nneeds to like\n>> that's what what what the skills changed\ncompared to tools.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But like yeah, sorry.\n>> But which which infrastructures code\ntechnology has the best tooling in that\nregard?\nKubernetes does come into my mind\nor do you think CDK is uh I mean are you\nmanaging infrastructure with AI and CDK\nis my next question.\n>> Actually funny I can give you an\nexample. Um because when I built Terra\nconstructs I copied the AWS CDK\ninterfaces. So my company they adopted\nGitHub copilot into PR review process\nand my colleague created a pull request\nwith Terra constructs that basically\ncreates a load balancer sets up\nlisteners and things like that but the\ncode is TypeScript and it looks like AWS\nCDK. So copilot started to to comment on\nit and say like hey um your load\nbalancer listener here uh is not using\nTLS or whatever. So even though um you\nknow it hasn't been trained on terra\nconstructs and\n>> and it had no it had no like uh what do\nyou call this type hinting or\n>> no nothing I I I think you know big part\nof the corpus I don't think we can\nimagine how much of of of you know these\nweights actually encapsulate it's like\nbillions of of internet data you can ask\nit something silly like um you ask about\ncats in in in in uh in Dermund Belgium\nand they will tell you about a tradition\nback in the Middle Ages where they throw\ncats off the walls and it's like who\nwould know that, right? And and it's not\nmade up like it's true.\n>> Why did they throw cats onto walls?\n>> After the winter um they they they kept\ncats to kill to prevent the mice to eat\nthe grains or something or to bite the\nrats or the mice were were destroying\nthe all of the storage like the linen\nand so on. So, so they have cats to\nhunt, but then when the summer comes\naround, they have too many cats, so they\nthrew them off the off the off the\ntowers. Uh, tradition, Belgian\ntradition.\n>> So dark. [laughter]\n>> So, this is one thing,\n>> but with Belgian, it's always like some\ndark stories like\n>> Yeah. So, if it knows this horrible\ndetail that we Belgians have been trying\nto hide, how of course it's going to\nknow how to write AWS CDK, you know.\n[laughter]\n>> Interesting. So, so you're basically\nsaying that it doesn't matter what you\nuse, AI is going to be flexible enough\nto get you there.\n>> And what I'm saying is for me and the\nreason why I spend all this time on what\nI'm doing for me AI is is pure\nintuition, right? All of this\nhallucination which we sometimes we\ndon't like, but sometimes it is pure\nlike out of the box thinking and we\nembrace it. All of this hallucination is\nintuition. it's built into the model to\nlike feel like that's the way I need to\ngo. So whatever you know framework you\nwork with should be an intuitive\nframework. So I feel AWS CDK is\nbeautiful because it's all about\nintentoriented methods. It's not like\nthis massive declarative get every\nsingle attribute correct or it's not\ngoing to work. It's intuitive. It's like\nI want to deploy I want to deploy my\nservice. I want to spread it one per\nnode. Um and and I want the spot\ndisruption budget. That's a good\nintuition.\n>> Yeah. So that's where I feel like it's\nbeen trained heavily on Typescript and\nJavaScript because that's like still in\nthe top one languages of of Stack\nOverflow every year. So it has a massive\namount of JavaScript samples and\nTypeScript samples. It has I don't know\nprobably more JavaScript and it has the\nideas and hallucinate and hallucinates\nconstantly. It's actually not Lams is\nall hallucination like every single\ntoken it outputs is just hallucination\nand int intuition right so the fact that\nit's correct these hallucinations are is\nis mindboggling right uh but the fact\nthat it can generate AWS CDK correctly\nand in Typescript to me is proof that I\nwould rather um focus on a highle\nlanguage like that\n>> yeah but don't you think it's strange\ndon't don't I mean surely\ngoing back to what I was asking earlier\nlike so you don't give a type hinting\nlike surely if you if you if you let uh\nClaude I mean VS code must somehow do\nthis but like if you open up a project\nwith with uh with with type checking\nthen\nand you let AI make some you let Claude\nmake some changes surely it it can\nrecognize that it's done a bad change\nwhen the uh LSP starts That's this is\nthe agent's shell, right? This is how\nthe shell surfaces the information\nto the LLM. It captures a whole bunch of\ninformation. It also gives it guidelines\nlike I made a change. Like if you look\nat cloud, it will say I made a change to\nthis file. Let me make sure I don't know\nit says low bandwidth. Maybe my\nconnection is bad.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. You just dropped out a bit.\n>> Sometimes cloud says,\n>> yeah. So, so cloud will say I made a\nchange to this file. Let me run the\ntests or let me let me run this. This is\nlike agent shell instructions, right?\nThis is like part of cloud code's magic\nsauce. It just it just says like you do\nthis then you do that. You run this\ntool. You connect to the IDE and look\nfor the problem. If you go to Visual\nStudio Code, you can see problems and\nsay file. Exactly.\n>> Yeah. Language servers integrations and\nso on. So this is agent cell. This is ID\ncontext. This is what makes a coding\nagent good at what it does by by\nsurfacing the information in small bits\nright when it's needed. Um,\n>> yeah, it's it's it's it's such an\nincredible technology, isn't it? It's so\nincredible.\n>> And and so what I wanted to give you an\nexample of where I think it's obvious\nthat cloud will not be good at doing\nthings with Terraform compared to AWS\nCDK.\n>> Okay, juicy. I had the requirement\na theory to set up swap files for nodes\nbecause we wanted to allow bursting. You\nknow, you can overshare resources on a\nnode and we wanted sometimes resources\nto be overs subscribed and some services\nto basically burst out and take more\nmemory than the node has. So we wanted\nto alleviate some of the pressure by\ncreating a swap file on disk. So I asked\ncloud to help me prepare the launch\ntemplates for the autoscaling group. And\nthis was pure terapform, no AWS CDK. And\nto do the swap file configuration, you\nhave to define the swappiness on the\ntask definition. But on Terraform, the\ntask definition is a massive JSON blob,\nright?\n>> It's just a massive JSON definition. And\ncloud can do like the first level of of\nof um of attributes of this JSON\ndefinition. it it can do it decently,\nbut it when I mention about swappiness,\nit also just put the attribute\nswappiness straight on like the the top\nlevel as an attribute as a field on a\nJSON document and it didn't work. Uh or\nit looked like it worked. It didn't give\nme any errors, right? But when I looked\ninto it, it actually didn't work. And I\nhad to look really deep into AWS docs to\nfigure out that swappiness was not a top\nlevel field, but was nested within\nsomething called kernel attributes or\nsomething like that. So on the ECS task\ndefinition, you had to create a field\ncalled kernel attributes. I'm not sure\nI'm just making that up, but it was\nsomething like that.\n>> And then there was a field under there\ncalled swappiness that you had to set to\nlike a certain value to actually take\neffect. Now both the AWS API did not\nthrow an error because it just ignored\nany unknown fields and and cloud did not\nknow what was wrong because it's just\nit's just a JSON blob. But if I look at\nAWS CDK, they actually exploded this\nthis this into a construct. They created\na task definition construct and every\npossible field um is properly structured\nin a TypeScript interface. So if you put\nswappiness of the top level, you get a\nTypeScript error that doesn't compile.\n>> Yeah, but that but but you're assuming\nthat someone's done the work in the CDK\nband. And that's the craziness about the\nAWS CDK is that somebody has been doing\nthe work for 10 years and it's likeund\ncontributors and it's spread across\n>> but that could work against you. They\nmight not have been well maintained and\nyou can't set\n>> well that's why a framework like that\nneeds to be backed by the cloud\nprovider. This only works on AWS CDK\nbecause AWS invests resources into\nbuilding this library. And that's why\nAWS CDK is much more powerful than\nTerraform because it's backed by AWS and\nfine-tuned for its cloud.\n>> And\nthat's what they use internally is what\nwe\n>> exactly because when I look at the pull\nrequests, they're like, I'm at a service\nteam of AWS and we need this, you know,\nthis particular EC2 or task definition\nfield needs to be made available. On the\ntopic of CDK, um, let me just share my,\nuh, thing again. I had a question for\nyou on operational flexibility\nor operational features.\nOkay. So, so here's an example. Uh I'm\nI'm maintaining u let's just call it an\nairflow an AWS ma MWAA airflow instance\nat work and it's getting overloaded. I\nneed to scale it up quickly. So in\nterraform\nif I was man if I was managing airflow\nin terraform I would set the CPU type\nfrom\nI don't know T1 to T5 or something M1 to\nM5 or something right and then I do then\nI do a plan and then I do apply and I\ndon't know half an hour later the\ninstance of airflow would have been\nupdated\nin AWS CDK land\nUm, again, I don't think it's any\nfaster, right? You you would still have\nto go into your CDK code, change of\nchange something, and then do a CDK\ndeploy, and it's probably the the same\namount of time as the Terraform plan and\napply. Right?\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that is\nthat is there\num what's the quickest way to make a\nquick change in of these technologies\nbesides don't say click ops I mean yeah\nI I think click ops is probably the\nfastest you know what I mean the speed\nto make a change\n>> I don't think we captured it very well\n>> um\nyeah I\nIt's a trade-off, right, that you you I\nit's all or nothing in these frameworks,\nright? You either go all in and you make\nsingle source of truth, Terraform, and\nthere's no way of making a change\noutside of Terraform. Um or you\ncompletely ignore that attribute in\nterapform and then people can change it\nand Terraform will not complain or try\nto revert it. You know, you can say life\ncycle ignore this attribute so try to\nreset it. Um that's where other\nframeworks recently try to improve\nbecause they say by nature the cloud is\nbirectional. It's not one way. You know\nforcing your infrastructure as code to\nbe single direction single sort of truth\nin practice doesn't work. It slows teams\ndown and that's where config that all of\nwhat I just said is basically from a\nblock um series from Brian Grant, right?\nthe guy who who then announced uh Config\nHub. So, their idea is that you must be\nable to go into your config store and\nchange a value and have it applied\nquickly without going through a massive\num and slow uh process. But that's a\ntrade-off, right? I mean their point is\nthat if you do it through our system I\nguess there's more tracing and more\ncontrol over it than if somebody goes in\nclick ops at least as the config field\nis stored inside the data and you can\nhave an audit trails there. I don't know\nI do feel you get you can you know have\nyour cloud trail\nevents siphoned off to just note what\ninfrastructure changes they are.\n>> Yeah. Um so system initiative they also\nhave this idea of we are a digital twin\nand we synchronize whatever you do in\nAWS back\n>> I need I need to give assistive\nsystem initiative a trial before I meet\nup go meet up with\n>> they have great ideas I mean the people\nbehind it have a lot of experience with\nchef and puppet and there some of the\nyou know original creators of some of\nthe ideas of how chef originally worked\nand they carried over after working with\nTerafhone for a long time and and they\nthey they just built a new idea and the\nway I understood from his podcast that I\nI listen was that system system\ninitiative is a programmable graph. So\nyou create nodes and every node in the\ngraph has hooks like create, read,\nupdate, delete and those notes those\nhooks are all programmable. So you can\ndecide this node\nIt doesn't. Yeah. This node if it gets\ncreated, this is how the function runs.\nAnd this node if it needs to be updated,\nthis is what function it runs. And you\ncan therefore build your own nodes. It's\nkind of like terapform provider\nresources, right? But all split out into\nindividual node because a terapform\nprovider resource has create, read,\nupdate, delete hooks, right? And the\ntelephone provider just looks at the\ngraph, determines that note needs to be\nupdated and then calls the update hook\nfor that resource and gives it the um\nyou know the actual values and and the\nthe new values and then that resource as\npart of the provider will apply those\nchanges by making the correct AWS API\ncalls. Right? So they they kind of take\nthis terapform provider but they split\nit out into individual programmable\nnodes and then they they reimplemented\neach of those nodes. What I don't like\nas far as I understand is that under the\nhood every single function of those\nnodes is like using AWS CLI commands. So\nit doesn't like it\n>> and and\nI don't know because honestly if you I\nthink they spent four years rebuilding\nTerraform provider AWS by defining every\nresource type as a node and giving it\ncreate read update scripts you've only\ndone the very basic foundation because\nwhat really makes infrastructure as code\npowerful is like what I just told you 10\nyears of AWS CDK and hundreds of\ncontributors splitting out every\npossible field and building integration\npattern.\nRight?\nImagine you spend four years\nre-implementing Terraform providers and\noffering it as a solution and you\nhaven't even gotten to the level of like\nnow I have a lambda and a gateway and I\nneed to integrate them and that means I\nneed to call all of these resources and\nI need to call all of these hooks in\nsequence. You're you've you\n>> Yeah. But the\nbut in a in an in a in a in an ideal\nworld the AWS CLI should be exposing\nthese things should be exposing even\nthese high level obstructions in some\nways the AWS CLI\num I mean I'm just playing devil's\nadvocate here\n>> the CLI should be should be actually the\ninterface\nshould be enough is what I'm trying to\nsay.\n>> Yeah. So, I haven't played enough with\nsystem initiative, but I can imagine\nthat based on what he says, if they\nstarted from scratch, it would take an\nimmense amount of work to reach anything\nlike AWS CDK level of UX\n>> or DevX developer experience. And sure\nyou can show a demo which he says we you\nknow we have a demo where you give us\nyour AWS account and we point system\ninitiative and it at it and it will very\nquickly create your AWS account\nresources as a digital twin in our graph\nour programmable graph and you can\nimmediately start modifying them through\nour interface with our digital twin\ntechnology but that doesn't talk about I\nam a devop developer and I need to\ndeploy nextgs\nAnd I don't care how to set up API\ngateway and every single lambda so that\nnextgs has a server side and can execute\nright because that is what a developer\nwants to do. This is the actual\nfunctionality like I started Terraform\nsorry I started my career you know\nunderstanding how the control plane\nworks how reconciliation loops works but\nif you work for an organization\nnobody cares right we need to deploy the\nfeature and what is the best\narchitecture for us to deploy it I don't\ncare how kubernetes you know atcd needs\nto be set up and backup procedures and\nall that you want to write code\n>> yeah I I that is the business value\nunless you're you're a hosted kubernetes\nthis cluster provider as a DevOps\nengineer you're coming in and only\nknowing how to set up clusters you don't\nbring any value unless you can do these\nhigh level integration patterns and\nafter you know it was very interesting\nfor me but after doing it for five or\nsix years I wanted to actually be\nvaluable [laughter] you know actually\nfocus on these hard\nlevel integration patterns as you'll as\nyou\nare only really possible with CDK right\nMhm.\n>> Yeah. So I CDK is great but there\nobviously I think other approaches like\nPulumi they I was very surprised because\nCDK has this as as I just explained it\nhas like these amazing deep level\nintegrations within the AWS services. So\nif you take a TypeScript object uh for\nthat represents an API gateway, it gives\nyou a method to to like bind it to a\nlambda and it knows exactly what to do\nunder the hood. Um Palumi is kind of\nlike starting from scratch and then\nbuild little like helper methods on top.\nFor example, the bucket object that you\nget within Palumi has the ID of like an\nonevent\num hook and and you can put the function\nhandler in that onevent.\nUh it's on the bucket object. You should\nsearch for bucket.onvent.\nAnd apparently that's not in their like\nL1s but also in in their like higher\nlevel on event. Yeah, I see it's in Pumi\ncrosswalks. So, so AWS CDK is like the\nthe L2, right? And Crosswalks is like\ntheir version of L2. It's like you take\nthe low-level bucket API object and then\nyou add ideas on top of like do onevent\nand and that's a really neat little\nthing. But again it required somebody at\npulley to implement the idea of a bucket\na cloudatch rule an SNS topic have this\nidea of invoking a function and does\nthey rep they they created a repeatable\npattern that on event you pack in you\npass in the function handler and it will\nautomatically create the bucket create\nthe lambda create the bucket\nnotification that calls the lambda set\nup the lambda permissions everything for\nyou right and then the only event is\nlike this this um this pattern that they\nexpose it's an interface because it's a\nprogramming language. So you can\nreimplement it. If you have something of\nyour own that you want to implement the\non event then you can implement exactly\nwhat are the grant permissions that need\nto be added to the policy. So you can\nimplement your own on event. So that's\nthe the the benefit of using a\nprogramming language. You can create an\ninterface. You can define a contract.\nYou can't do that with terapform\nmodules. Can you try to think about\ndoing that with terapform modules?\nWell, and I'm and going back to your IM\nexample\nto achieve these these priv privileges\nwithout some sort of dynamism is going\nto be hard.\n>> Yeah, that's exactly because of you have\nthis like synthesis time, lazy\nevaluation, late binding, setting\nproperties after the program has\nexecuted.\n>> But I can't think this cuts both ways. I\nmean\n[sighs and gasps]\nthere surely there's an argu there's an\nargument\n>> policy that you want to to attach\n>> there's there's an argument to be made\nis like as soon as someone starts\nwriting a whole bunch of code with with\nlike onvent uh logic it's going to get\npretty probably quite difficult to\nfollow right the beauty of opening up a\nlot of terraform projects is that you\nkind of know what's what's happening and\nit's kind of it's constrained by by the\nby the language right if if like just\nlike any code in the world if people can\ndo things they will and it will just get\ncomplex without any\n>> uh yes without any uh abandon right\n>> I just got the question to the today\nfrom someone he says like do you think\nthat it makes sense to target an\nintermediate DSL and and when you're\nsaying what you're saying just now it's\nLike with the terra constructs, if you\ndo this complicated coupling uh of of\ncreating a lambda in an API gateway\nultimately when you run synth you get a\nflat config file which is the DSL that\nis terraform and you can run your\nwhatever um you know llinters and\nproblems but it's probably going to be\nfishly complex but yeah okay\n>> yeah because the cloud is complex dude\n>> this was I Um the trade-off is you're\ngetting\ncapabilities,\nelasticity\nand uptime for services to move fast in\nterms of a business value and does it\nend up being complex? What's the\nalternative? You're going to spin up an\nEC2 instance and build your own and then\nyou know yeah on it there's different\nway there's different ways of looking at\nit like\nyou know, the more I need to give system\ninitiative a bit of a whirl to be\nhonest,\n>> but I'm I'm start I'm but like I'm I'm\nmy I'm working backwards from AI\nand I feel with AI it's about uh I mean\nit's also it's also about the same thing\nfor humans really it's about iteration\nspeed and uh\n>> and a to and a and a tool full chain\nlike I'm just thinking aloud that like\nmaybe calling AWS CLI from from Claude\nuh you know something where system\ninitiative does behind the behind the\nscenes is perhaps not a terrible way of\nuh bootstrapping an account right to\nwhat it needs to do for for for\na you know a typical a typical\norganization and let's take a step back\nwhat you just said about iteration and\nachieving results quickly. Um, it's kind\nof like how how I was understanding what\nyou're saying. I think this is also\nrelated to people like originally people\nwere like, \"Oh, Kubernetes is going to\ngive me this full cloud independence.\nI'm going to be able to do multicloud,\nyou know, as a resilience strategy and\nand and everything, right?\" Very quickly\nthat breaks down because the advantage\nof being in a cloud is to maximize its\ncapabilities. Like if you are an AI team\nand you need to set up like this complex\num data ETL pipeline, but you need to be\ncompletely cloud independent and you\nneed to do everything yourself versus oh\nI'm going to use some step functions or\ndurable lambdas now and I'm going to\nleverage all of the serverless\ncapabilities and I've got something\nworking you know because you have like\nDBOS you just define your your\nprogramming and then under the hood\nwhenever a function is called, it can be\nsuspended and it can be persisted and I\ndon't need to worry about exactly how\nall of that works. I can just focus pure\non my business flow and it's a neat\nclear data pipeline and under the hood\nit's it's automatically creating lambdas\nand they are being suspended when\nthey're waiting for events and they're\nresumable and it's taking care of of of\num making sure that the event is\npropagated and no notifications are\nbeing missed and and all of this like\nfall torren and and and re repeat and\nthat that letter Q setup and all of this\ncomplexity gets handled by a cloud layer\nand that gives you the ability to move\nforward and to deliver a feature that's\nbetween in in an organization\nthat's between being the market layer or\nbeing leader of being out of out of the\nmarket and closing down.\n>> I worked in many organizations.\n>> Well, okay. Just to replay my\nunderstanding what you just said is that\nlike if you don't uh\nget fine if if you don't\nget\n>> realize\n>> get down in the weeds then you're not\nreally innovating type is what I is what\nI heard.\n>> It's more about if you what is what\nbusiness are you delivering? What is\nyour core business right? your core\nbusiness is not creating a perfect ECS\ncluster and and taking care exactly of\nlike setting up um pipeline that that\ndoes exactly one delivery of all the\nmessages and and does does all of this\ncore like engineering most organizations\njust need to deliver business value or\nthey're or they they die\n>> they're out of business. Yeah. And then\nyou\n>> I think you made the argument that like\nyou can't do this in the CLI. You need\nto you need to get down into the the\ndetails. I mean sorry if I My link back\nto to what you were saying earlier about\num\nmy link back was basically\nmaximizing highle services of cloud\nwithout\num\nworrying about it not being reproducible\nor um yeah I don't know I I I had a\npoint\n>> okay we we I sorry I I my kids uh need\nto be taken to school so I ran out of I\nsound like I have a point just now. I\nneed to rewatch this to remember what my\npoint is.\n>> Okay,\n>> I'll put it in the comments.\n>> We'll we'll get to the point. Thanks for\nwatching if you're watching this. Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–6:02]\nWelcome to episode 12 of the AI Infrastructure Podcast with me, Kai Hendry in the UK and Vincent Smith over in Vietnam. In this episode, we talk about CDKTF. And long story short, we try to rationalize where CDKTF fits in in light of the recent deprecation by Hashi Corp/ IBM. And we we do justify CDK. Uh well, let me give you a summary why we think CDK is important. It's a high level abstraction and it allows complicated cloud infrastructure to be reasoned about. It allows you to get the most out of the cloud to differentiate. And if you just think conversely perhaps if you got if you vibe coded your infrastructure using I don't know AWS CLI or something you just couldn't get uh a solid reproducible deterministic infrastructure that way you need higher level constructs uh that the AWS CDK sort of provide you. So you ideally need to work with it. So in light of the deprecation of of IBM that we need to find a place for for CDK a programming language in order to do the next level stuff with the cloud and infrastructure. So enjoy the episode. Please uh if if CDKTF doesn't uh tickle your fancy, check out the other stuff in the playlist and have a merry Christmas. See you. Goodbye. Yeah, this guy. Which which guy? >> So, since CDKTF was sunset by IBM and I created a fork under a project that I built a bunch of CDKF L2 constructs. There's one guy who's been contributing three PRs over well so far he's contributed I think seven PRs already and I merged six and he keeps adding cool stuff. It's amazing. >> Yeah. So you just forked it and and >> No, no, no. He contributes. [clears throat] So the one that I forked, I put it on pause, right? We're waiting for a go- ahead. Um we're collaborating with the Open Construct Foundation which um hosts several of the you know CDK related projects and we're trying to find a final and good name. Um hopefully we don't have to rename but I sincere I seriously doubt that Hashi Corp is going to allow us to use the original CDKTF package names. So we'll probably have to rename it. And I renamed the TCON which is Terra Constructs. It's a four-letter acronym and people obviously don't like that. TCON sounds familiar now. [snorts] >> Yeah. Terra Constructs is the library that I built. >> Oh okay. >> Yeah. So tons is is what I you know it's a scope that I have on npmgs. So I use it for a lot of stuff. So I was like, \"Yeah, I'm just going to reuse I just took immediate action, right? Fork it and rename it to my stuff and then [snorts]…\n\n[slide:2] [5:41–17:43]\nversion 24 for other regions where NodeJS version 24 has already been deployed right it takes time for this stuff to deploy >> so [clears throat] other stuff is like uh S3 bucket endpoints or like the domain suffix of an S3 uh original endpoint point, right? The URL suffix that um they changed the way that that S3 works over the years. So new regions, they use a different suffix. >> So the you know, I think I noticed that. >> Yeah. So the AWS CDK has logic in it that uses a fact table about the regions to figure out how to build a a bucket or like if you give it a a bucket URL or just a bucket name and and it's it has a it has a regional like your AWS CDK stack has a region. So then it uses that information to find out yeah what's going to be the domain URL for that bucket depending on the region. So I had copied that over. I had copied over the fact table into my code because I didn't know it was a separate package. And he says, \"Well, you know, we don't have to copy over the details. We can just reuse the AWS CDK package on top of CDKTF.\" >> Cool. This actually looks like a pretty good contribution. Holy moly. I'm I'm >> Oh yeah, dude. All of his contributions have been absolute fire. The only thing is he doesn't write integration tests. So every single one of them I I check out and I um I I build an integration test and I validate that you can actually terraform deploy it into AWS and doesn't get any errors. Yeah. But he's been he's been aligning Terra constructs closely to AWS CDK. >> Cool. So I got a couple of maybe noob questions for you but like I guess this might serve the audience. So CDK for Terraform basically allow people to write in that familiar CDK style which was which was like which came out of >> AWS >> AWS uh what's his name? Ben Ben Israel right that guy >> not Ben Israel >> um who was it again? Is it worth mentioning her name? Who? What? Sorry. >> Who who who was the guy that was in the original team that he left and he he did did Wing Wing Lang? >> Yeah. Elot Ben Israel. Uh Elot Ben Israel. >> Oh, I I wasn't wrong with the name. Okay. Sorry. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> I thought I was making up the his name or something. So, CDK cool beans. I think we went through yesterday that it was like the the thing that really makes it different is that is that it's operationally uh friendly. You can refactor this the stuff and it's a programming language un unlike maybe Terraform and things like that. Now the thing that I don't understand is how it…\n\n[slide:3] [17:23–29:26]\nconstructor and maybe the one thing that you get is you're able to use like um lazy evaluations basically you And for some attributes, you can provide a function instead of an actual value. And so when it synthesizes, it's going to execute the function to basically decide what the value for that property needs to be. And that is very powerful already, right? Because it means that depending on how you call it, a function can execute and then determine what the value for this particular attribute could be. Um, for example, if you are where is this like really useful? Yeah, maybe in policies, right? Let's say that you you are you are building some type of infrastructure and you're using an IM policy and you're using a bunch of other resources and you want the policy to be generated at the very end after the user has already defined the full program and all of the configuration that he wants to be >> generated. Yeah, there's a lease privileges type thing. M >> yeah the functions can be very smart and identify exactly what are the actions that need to be added into the policy depending on what the user um you know connected. So it's kind of like it's kind of a mixture of like an imperative language to create a declarative definition of infrastructure as code and like people are like oh you know why would you do that you know is all about declarative and you you cannot do mix it with imperative you start doing that people will no longer like know exactly what's going on uh but if you look at the language itself since uh terraform 0.12 you know before it became uh stable they added um list comprehensions they added dynamic values dynamic you know for each and there's a very clear reason why they did that because you can't manage AWS resources with pure static definitions you're always before that you have free processors people wrote template languages to generate terapform configuration >> yeah yeah I feel I feel this is a trend in infrastructures co in infrastructure game is like the days have gone where you can just declaratively put thing is in YAML, right? You you need >> you need a programming language and then >> you're going to keep adding layers and layers of abstraction to work around this this core missing feature that you are not working with a proper language programming language and then you start adding um config language. >> Yeah. So generators >> I guess in a in a very uh succinct way CDK gives you the binds to a proper programming language and…\n\n[slide:4] [29:06–41:14]\nfunction, you can see a preview, and then you can approve and then boom, it's GitOps. It gets ops in a in a in a like reasonable way. >> Have you used this product? Have you used this yourself? >> Uh no, but I um I understand the idea because a lot of what what he built originally with customize, you know, the idea of applying JSON patches, they kind of like extended it as those get JSON patches now run as part of like ant hooks. haven't used it. They just made it like >> Oh, yeah. We were talking about hooks yesterday. What was using hooks again? Oh my god. >> Oh, can do can do >> Yeah. Yeah. The hooks thing is >> in the CDK as well. >> This kind of a little bit different. Hooks. >> Yeah. But this one in my mind >> I don't know if config hub can can manage any other configuration except for Kubernetes. This this is like firmly settled in the idea of like a reconciliation loop and and having a control plane that runs that constantly runs these reconciliation loops and automatically adjust your like with eventual consistency adjust your your cloud towards it. Right? >> So which is one thing that Terraform does not have right terraform you run an apply and it doesn't touch it until the next time you run an apply where Kubernetes is constantly re-evaluating your infrastructure and making sure that it is aligned. I the the one thing uh [snorts] was so like let me start with the problem at what we're using terraform uh actually this is a problem with CDK too the whole CDK deploy thing is a bit slow but okay never mind that >> that's cloudformation issues >> that's that's infrastructures yeah that's that's cloudformation issues but um stop me if I talked about this before but one one issue that we have right now is that we're using uh database we're using Terraform to to manage Snowflake and we don't want to we don't want to delete the resources because that could lead to data loss and all >> stuff and we don't want to recreate resources. So, so I have I have like some crappy >> worried about constantly re like >> Yeah, I have some crappy what do you call it? You know, uh GitHub workflow where I basically inspect the plan to make sure to make sure it's not deleting anything. But I thought to myself, come on, there's got to be a better way because because right now we have a we have a separate plan and an apply stage. Why? Because we want people to do a plan before they know what they're doing before they delete things. Unfortunately, no one really reads the…\n\n[slide:5] [40:54–52:57]\ntime teaching it something new, I suppose, is what I'm trying to lose. >> So, that's where everyone jumped on creating MCP servers or or finding ways to to provide the LLM, the generic LLM that has been trained of lots of data to basically give it the right context for the work that it needs to do. So, if you're take a generic >> MCP, MCP is more for doing tool calls than giving context. Some people seem to mix that up a bit. >> I think it's No, it's the difference is tool calls allow you to pull in context on demand. The LLM sees a tool that says you can call me to get information about the weather in in London. Um, you can call me. >> So, it's tool calls >> give the LLMs the arms and legs to reach out into the world to find information that it doesn't have. >> So, it can do it on its own. If you if you don't use tool calls, you as an operator of the LLM have to kind of figure out everything that that LLM might need to solve the problem that you're trying to do, right? >> On the subject of tools, you know, Kubernetes tools, cubectl is pretty pretty awesome, isn't it? >> Um, so that's where things have evolved, right? If you if you use cloud code skills and you give it a high level overview what cubectl can be used for and then it goes and finds out more information about like the user has a problem uh with autoscaling and I need to figure out if there's enough capacity in the cluster and then it goes off and uh finds the cubectl commands that you know tells it how much like the top like node stop for example to see how much CPU is being used across the cluster. So, so skills are this like gradual discovery of information without overloading the context with every possible uh tool that the QTL exposes, right? because ultimately cubectl can be used in such a way that you can overload um with like hundreds of tools but you you need to slice it and dice it down into like you know if you're working on this particular problem then you might want to look at this set of tools uh and if you want to work on that type of problem you want to look at this set of tools so then cloud knows like hey I'm looking at this type of problem oh can can we go look at those set of tools and then loads them in and figures out that it needs to like >> that's what what what the skills changed compared to tools. >> Yeah. Yeah. But like yeah, sorry. >> But which which infrastructures code technology has the best tooling in that regard? Kubernetes does come into my mind or do you…\n\n[slide:6] [52:36–59:13]\nor operational features. Okay. So, so here's an example. Uh I'm I'm maintaining u let's just call it an airflow an AWS ma MWAA airflow instance at work and it's getting overloaded. I need to scale it up quickly. So in terraform if I was man if I was managing airflow in terraform I would set the CPU type from I don't know T1 to T5 or something M1 to M5 or something right and then I do then I do a plan and then I do apply and I don't know half an hour later the instance of airflow would have been updated in AWS CDK land Um, again, I don't think it's any faster, right? You you would still have to go into your CDK code, change of change something, and then do a CDK deploy, and it's probably the the same amount of time as the Terraform plan and apply. Right? What I'm trying to say here is that is that is there um what's the quickest way to make a quick change in of these technologies besides don't say click ops I mean yeah I I think click ops is probably the fastest you know what I mean the speed to make a change >> I don't think we captured it very well >> um yeah I It's a trade-off, right, that you you I it's all or nothing in these frameworks, right? You either go all in and you make single source of truth, Terraform, and there's no way of making a change outside of Terraform. Um or you completely ignore that attribute in terapform and then people can change it and Terraform will not complain or try to revert it. You know, you can say life cycle ignore this attribute so try to reset it. Um that's where other frameworks recently try to improve because they say by nature the cloud is birectional. It's not one way. You know forcing your infrastructure as code to be single direction single sort of truth in practice doesn't work. It slows teams down and that's where config that all of what I just said is basically from a block um series from Brian Grant, right? the guy who who then announced uh Config Hub. So, their idea is that you must be able to go into your config store and change a value and have it applied quickly without going through a massive um and slow uh process. But that's a trade-off, right? I mean their point is that if you do it through our system I guess there's more tracing and more control over it than if somebody goes in click ops at least as the config field is stored inside the data and you can have an audit trails there. I don't know I do…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This episode of the AI Infrastructure Podcast features Kai Hendry and Vincent Smith discussing the evolving landscape of the Cloud Development Kit (CDK), specifically focusing on the future of CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) following its deprecation by HashiCorp and IBM. The conversation centers on why high-level abstractions are essential for managing modern cloud complexity and how programming languages provide a superior interface compared to traditional declarative configuration files. The hosts argue that as infrastructure becomes more intricate, the ability to reason about systems through code—rather than \"vibe coding\" via the command line—is the only way to achieve reproducible and deterministic results. *It's a high level abstraction and it allows complicated cloud infrastructure to be reasoned about.*\n\n[slide:1]\n## The Terra Constructs Fork\nFollowing the sunsetting of CDKTF by IBM, Vincent Smith took immediate action by forking the project to ensure the continued availability of L2 constructs. This fork, currently referred to by the working name Terra Constructs or \"TCON,\" is being developed in collaboration with the Open Construct Foundation. The foundation serves as a neutral host for various CDK-related projects, providing a path forward for the community. While the project is currently in a transitional phase regarding its final naming—due to likely trademark restrictions from HashiCorp—it has already seen significant community engagement. One contributor has already submitted seven high-quality pull requests, focusing on refactoring and aligning the library more closely with the core AWS CDK. This community-driven effort aims to maintain the operational friendliness and refactorability that the original CDK brought to the infrastructure-as-code ecosystem.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Regional Fact Tables and CDKTF Mechanics\nA key technical advantage of the CDK ecosystem is the regional information library, which maintains a \"fact table\" of cloud capabilities across different global regions. This library tracks details such as which NodeJS versions are supported in specific regions (e.g., version 22 in China versus version 24 in standard regions) and the specific domain suffixes for S3 bucket endpoints. By leveraging these fact tables, CDKTF can dynamically determine the correct configuration for a resource based on the stack's target region, a task that is often manual and error-prone in raw Terraform. CDKTF works by synthesizing a tree of constructs into raw, readable Terraform configuration. While it generates unique logical IDs with hash suffixes to prevent naming conflicts in nested modules, the final output is standard Terraform that can be inspected and deployed using existing workflows. This allows teams to bridge the gap between the expressive power of TypeScript and the established reliability of the Terraform provider ecosystem.\n\n[slide:3]\n## The Power of Imperative Abstractions\nThe discussion highlights a major trend in infrastructure: the shift from declarative YAML to imperative programming languages. CDK allows for \"lazy evaluation\" and late binding, where functions can execute during the synthesis phase to determine attribute values. This is particularly powerful for complex tasks like generating IAM policies, where the code can programmatically identify the exact actions required based on the resources connected by the user. This approach moves beyond the limitations of static definitions, which often require pre-processors or complex template languages to handle dynamic logic. The hosts note that even Terraform has moved toward this by adding list comprehensions and dynamic blocks, but a proper programming language like TypeScript offers a more robust environment for building these abstractions. CDK for Kubernetes (CDK8s) applies these same principles, allowing developers to define high-level intentions—such as pod spreading rules—that are then translated into the verbose and deeply nested API objects required by Kubernetes.\n\n[slide:4]\n## GitOps and Reconciliation Loops\nThe conversation explores the \"rendered manifest pattern\" within GitOps, emphasizing the importance of keeping the source of truth in Git as close to the final state as possible. Tools like Argo CD and Flux are discussed as ways to manage this, though the hosts caution against performing \"magic\" on the server side, such as last-minute Helm rendering. Instead, they advocate for rendering manifests into Git so that the deployment tool simply fires raw configuration at the Kubernetes API. This section also contrasts Terraform's \"plan and apply\" model with the continuous reconciliation loops of Kubernetes. While Terraform only updates infrastructure when a command is manually or programmatically run, Kubernetes constantly monitors and corrects the state of the cluster. This difference is crucial when managing stateful resources like databases; the hosts suggest that stateful data should often live outside the cluster to allow the infrastructure itself to remain stateless and easily rebuildable.\n\n[slide:5]\n## AI Intuition and Type Safety\nAI's role in infrastructure is a major theme, with the hosts arguing that CDK's structure makes it more resilient to AI \"hallucinations\" than raw JSON or YAML. Because CDK is built on strongly typed interfaces, an AI generating code will be constrained by the language's type system. For example, if an AI attempts to place a \"swappiness\" attribute at the wrong level of an ECS task definition, a TypeScript-based CDK project will throw a compilation error. In contrast, the AWS API might simply ignore unknown fields in a JSON blob, leading to silent failures. *The fact that it can generate AWS CDK correctly and in Typescript to me is proof that I would rather focus on a highle language.* The discussion also touches on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows LLMs to use \"tools\" to discover information about a cluster on demand, such as checking CPU usage via cubectl, rather than trying to fit the entire cluster state into a limited context window.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Delivering Business Value Over Clusters\nThe final segment addresses the ultimate goal of infrastructure engineering: delivering business value. While new technologies like System Initiative offer innovative \"digital twin\" approaches and programmable graphs for infrastructure, the hosts emphasize that the most valuable tools are those that allow developers to move fast without getting bogged down in low-level details. AWS CDK is praised for its \"intent-oriented\" methods, which encapsulate ten years of community knowledge and AWS service team contributions. This allows a developer to deploy a complex application—like a Next.js site with Lambda and API Gateway—without needing to manually configure every underlying permission and routing rule. The trade-off between \"click-ops\" for speed and IaC for reproducibility is a constant challenge, but the hosts conclude that leveraging high-level, cloud-backed abstractions is the most effective way to innovate and maintain a competitive edge in the market."
