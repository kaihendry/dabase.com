It\nsays you're on the you're seeing the\nfree plan because I'm using the cloud\nAPI.\nSo if I go to settings usage.\nOkay. No, I guess. So yeah, long story\nshort, I'm I've used $80 this month.\n>> 80?\n>> Yeah. Is that good?\n>> That's a lot more than me, bro. You\nalways keep saying, \"How can I use so\nmuch AI credits?\" And now you're using a\nlot more. [laughter]\n>> So if I But I I'm pretty sure that I\nlooked at Claude yesterday. You talked\nabout trust and um about trusting the\ncode. Now you have seven, but that's\nyour VS Code spend. That's different,\nright? That's not your cloud.\nThat's GitHub. Yeah.\nBut how much?\n>> You have no budget.\n>> But still, it makes it look like I've\ngot 75% premium requests used.\n>> I I just don't understand it. I mean,\nhow if I can't understand\nhow I'm spending money\non\nAI? Yeah. So, it basically kind of\nshocked me because if I'm like, if you\nhad to How much are you spending on AI\nright now? Then\nI pay Well, I'm always confused between\nSingapore dollars and US dollars. I\nthink what I'm seeing is Singapore\ndollars 30 for an entropic monthly\nsubscription. and I added another 30 in\nmy wallet with a $20 monthly cap. So in\ntotal if I I spend everything I I I'd\nhit 50 if it's in dollars 50 and then\nand just just to\n>> screen froze.\n>> Yeah, it's frozen for me too. Hold on.\nLet me see if I can just switch to my\n>> You're in a\n>> FaceTime camera.\n>> Funny pose.\nI I like to use the my my uh my phone\nbecause the quality is so much better.\n>> Okay. That was 50 on Antropic, right? Um\nwhen you\n>> Yeah. So, sorry when I said you spend 80\nis more than me. I did not take into\naccount Chad GPT and uh Gemini U\nsubscriptions.\n>> So, you're spending you're spending like\n100. The the scary thing is is like I'm\nlike if if my employer said, \"Oh, Kai,\nyou're spending too much on Claude.\nWe're not going to finance your $80.\" I\nfeel like it's the same thing with AWS\nbecause I have my own AWS account just\nfor like learning and doing things.\nAnd that cost me like 30 bucks a month\nbecause I can't get it lower than that\nbecause I've loaded up with some S3. So,\nI'm just I'm I'm a little bit worried\nthat as a as a worker that I have to\ntake on these costs and like my wife\nlike bemonones me about our Netflix and\nall these other subscriptions if if we\nall if if I have to maintain an AI\nsubscription of 100 bucks a month. I\nmean, is that is it's a bit annoying,\nbut I guess it's worth it. But,\n>> bucks is Yeah,\n>> 100 bucks is something but like it's\nworth it. I mean I do feel I do feel\nenergized and\n>> and motivated to get things done with\nwith the help of AI you know never mind\nit like completing my code like the\nplanning everything it really really\nhelps at least me\n>> never mind it also taking on a funny\nthing right I was installing posgress on\nan EC2 instance in the Singapore AWS\nregion and it was taking a very long\ntime it looked like it was hanging I was\nusing a packer build script right\nsupposedly completely finishes in 15\nminutes but just adding Postgress now it\nwas like hanging for 10 minutes before\nit even like finished the Postgress\ninstallation which I put early in the\ninstallation process [gasps] and after\ntroubleshooting it with AI for a while\nit just said well you know we looked we\nwe signed in we had package generate a\nseparate uh debug SSH key so I could log\nin to see to monitor the progress and we\nwe concluded that the the transfer was\njust slow because we're downloading from\nlike universal DBN packages and Um, and\nso it suggested a couple of mirrors, but\nthen we had to validate because the\nmachine was ARM and not all mirrors\nsupport ARM packages.\n>> And so it did some latency like we ended\nup writing a latency checker for the\nseveral um Singapore\n>> mirrors available for like DBN ports or\nwhatever. And I ended up with like um\nand and then there was a an edge case\nwhere one of the mirrors maintenance\npage show that they were no longer\nsupported but according to the benchmark\nresults had like a sub millisecond\nlatency which turned out to be a treat a\nredirect to an error page and so it\ndidn't validate the the actual binary\ncontents of of the package that was\nsupposed to be there. Right. So it just\nYeah. So it it responded 200. Okay. But\nthe actual contents of the index was an\nerror page.\n>> Yeah. So, so then we ended up with like\na whole a whole script to validate\nmirrors for Ubuntu package for DBN\npackages that are ARM compatible. Uh\nwell, any compatible because it checked\nthe architecture of the of the u of the\nthe kernel, right? So, so just to say\nlike yes, AI is so exciting, but as part\nof my process, I ended up writing a\nbenchmark script for [laughter] the\nSingapore.\n>> Yeah, you get nice little surprises and\nbonuses and and all sorts of artifacts\nout of it.\nOh my gosh. So,\n>> finished.\n>> I want you to pick up on with on you on\nthe um\nSorry, I lost my train of thought. I'm\njust I'm just I'm just kind of like I\ndon't know. I'm just like [snorts]\n>> It's too early.\n>> Yeah, it is a bit early. Yeah. I'm just\nthinking that like how how much is AI\nworth to me? It's like it's now just\nit's now undeniable. I cannot live\nwithout it. I'm just a little bit sad\nabout it.\n>> It's funny because originally I had like\nthese these talks and panel discussions\nand everyone agreed like we we we do a a\nFriday, no AI Friday to make sure that\nour muscles are still being exercised. I\nhaven't even thought about that in the\nlast four months to consider no AI\nFriday cuz [sighs]\n>> are we are we addicts? Are we I mean you\ntalk about your supply all the time. I'm\ntalking how I can't live without it. Are\nwe\naddicted to AI?\nSad is it? I don't think it's sad. I\nthink the amount of output and I don't\nthink it's illusionary output as well. I\nthink it's real output. there's a 100%\nsure that I couldn't do what I've built\ntoday without the assistance\nuh and also the motivation that it gives\nyou you know because no matter what you\ncome up with it will come up with like\nsomething that looks plausible and once\nand then some cause fallacy once you're\ndown the the road you just persist until\nit's there and then you need AI to get\nyou out\num yeah but but when I was saying costs\nfor AI and I think like entertainment\nsubscription is similar Right. Actually,\nlike my chip is the good thing about\nOpenAI is it's completely shared with my\nfamily. Maybe it's not good that my son\nis using it all the time because he's\nliterally giving like verbatim\nassignments like here's a story analyzed\nfor literature like\n>> yeah I got I got my wife using Claude\n>> and she\nthe interesting thing she said yesterday\nin the car [clears throat] was that she\nwanted to cancel it but then she said to\nme because I think Gemini does the same\nthing but then I asked Gemini a question\nand it completely messed it\nand Gemini got it really right. Um, and\nClaude got it right. So now I'm thinking\nI shouldn't cancel the subscription. I\nwas going, \"Yeah, maybe you should keep\nClaude.\"\n>> I subscribed Gemini last month when I I\nwas I think it was a bug with OpenAI\nwhen they did the release. That's it\nshowed like that you had used all your\nbudget at some point. It displayed that\nall the time. So, I was out of codeex\nand cloud and I was like, well, I really\nwant to like continue and I was hoping\nbetting on Gemini 3 coming out anyway.\nSo, I was like, I might as well, you\nknow, subscribe to that while I'm at it\nwith the intention to cancel it if it\nwasn't worth it. And I think I should\ncancel it\n>> Yeah. But it's the same thing like I\nhave Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon\nPrime. I mean, honestly, Amazon Prime is\nvery small amount.\n>> Mhm. Um, and and\n>> yeah, yeah, Amazon Prime is the\ncheapest.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. And yeah,\n>> Disney Plus, I think I want to cancel it\nbecause the most expensive and honestly\nthe output is so bad.\n>> What What about cloud services like like\nAWS? I mean, you must have like a $30 a\nmonth type thing that I do.\n>> Oh, yeah. I um I do have an AWS account.\nI think it's something around that. I\nhave a CDM for the project which is\nbacked by static S3. I have no like it's\nall serverless. I don't even use\nlambdas. It's all static basically. Um\njust the route 53 uh the TLS like the\ncertificates.\nUm but the TLS is free, right? But it's\nalso the\nuh what's it? Well, the CloudFront\ndistribution itself. Uh what else? uh\nthe the the route 53 like domain\nregistration because I do have some\ndomains via namecheep but I think it's\nso much easier to just go through AWS\nand like the cost difference make it\nlike\nbuilding\n>> account I guess the $30 a month I mean\nI'm aggregating it but it's because I\nmaintain\nyou know eight domains that I've never\nreally used in my life but I still pay\nfor them because I'm an idiot. So this\nthis this topic will be like how to like\nall of the useless stuff we pay for.\n[laughter]\n>> Yeah, something like that.\nUm, sorry, I'm still trying to gather my\nthoughts. There was something I wanted\nto chat to you about. Um\nyeah, you you mentioned that like\nswitching to plan you you don't use plan\nmode anymore like I I\n>> so so because planning is like under the\nspec kit where it creates a detailed\nmultihase and then boils it down to each\nindividual file exactly what needs to\nchange.\n>> Oh this is because you spec it right?\nYou don't need plan what you're saying.\nSo now if I like initially when I did\nthat I went into cloud and as usual fire\nup plan mode to create like a bunch of\nto-do items and then read the spec but\nwhat I found is that cloud sometimes\njust changes the plan like even though\nthe task description are clear this is\nwhat you need to do in this file and it\njust goes and does something slightly\ndifferent and then in the overall design\nthings don't work anymore. I I've seen\ncloud do that. So I'm actually now cloud\ncode plan mode is detrimental to my\n>> that doesn't sound good at all.\nI'm I'm plan mode. I'm plan mode all the\nway, man.\n>> That's why you start, right? But I've\nalso the reason why I sent you that\nmessage is because I saw two or three\nthreads on Reddit uh yesterday because\nwith the new Opus 4.5 release, they also\nrevised the way plan works and they said\nfor Opus even it's worse because now OPU\nspends up spins up sub agents and then\nworks off summary results and as a\nresult doesn't get like as good a um a\nplan anymore. So people are complaining\nthat\n>> is like a a better planning model, isn't\nit?\n>> Yes. But it spins up sub aents to\nexplore the codebase and then works off\nthose results which are inaccurate.\nSo if if you were to use Opus, which is\na more expensive per token cost,\n>> you get more you get other things you\ndon't want with it. Is that is that what\nyou're saying?\n>> No. No. If you were to use Opus, which\nis like very more expensive per token,\nuh it would itself read and understand\neverything and then make a make a plan\nout of it, right? But because they're\ntrying to save cost, they are like\nhaving Opus more as the orchestrator\nspinning up sub agents that go and read\nthings then create summaries and then\nfeeds that back to Opus. As a result,\nthose summaries are not as accurate and\nOpus makes incorrect plans. That's the\ncomplaints that I read on Reddit um\ntoday and and I was like actually it's\nnot a problem for me because I'm not\neven using plan mode anymore. Even\nbefore the update, I already noticed\nthat there was something wrong with it.\n>> In in your screencast you you shared\nwith me there's something else that I\ndidn't quite understand or I haven't\nseen before. You using anti-gravity, I\nguess, right?\n>> I'm using what? Sorry.\n>> You were using anti-gravity.\n>> Anti-gravity. Yeah. Yeah, there was this\nworkflow thing that I had.\n>> Yeah, but like you were choosing there\nwas an option down by the model where\nyou were choosing if it was like\n>> Oh, that's high, medium, or low\nreasoning or something.\n>> Oh, that's a that's a codeex plugin. No.\n>> Oh, can you just show that? Like what?\nWhy? Why would you\n>> twiggle that toggle?\n>> Uh, which one is it? This one.\n>> Yeah. Can you just zoom in down there?\nSo to see your\n>> how would I zoom in? I can do this. Is\nthat zooming in?\n>> Um Oh, I thought you might use the the\nApple zoom which is like I don't know\nwhat I think you have to enable\n>> but you can read it, right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah, it's good. But\n>> the setup is to put on your VS code your\nchat window on the right on this right\nsidebar.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And by default you will get your co your\nVisual Studio Code\n>> um here. Right. And you can choose\ncodeex. Yeah,\n>> those are the ones that you get with\nyour your co-pilot subscription.\n>> Yeah, and I'm locked into 4.5, that's\nfor sure.\n>> I mean, um,\n>> and then\n>> I have installed another plugin here\nwhich is called Codeex.\nSo, I have the the cloud code plugin,\nbut I also have the codeex plugin, the\nOpenAI codeex. Where is it?\n>> Yeah, it was up the top there. I think\nit was at the top. Uh,\n>> this one.\n>> Yeah. So when I I started using codeex\nthrough this CLI um it was horrible\nbecause you couldn't paste screenshots.\nIt was really bad compared to cloud code\nright. So I installed this plugin and\nhere you can put images you can easily\nrefer to files things that the CLI don't\nreally has properly and down here when\nyou select the model that's where then\nyou can now access with your I have chv\nplus right $20 a month I can access now\nin my VS code through that subscription\nGPT 5.1 codeex with high reasoning I\nthink it's a promotion they're trying to\nsee how well the model does\n>> I don't understand why why couldn't the\nthe co-pilot chat expose 5.1 C codeex\nmax. So this is something also I just\nread on on uh on Reddit the other day\nwas people asking like what's the\ndifference between running Sun 4.5 here\nand running cloud code son here in the\nin the terminal I can run them both\nright and one of the comments and I\ndon't know if this is verified said that\nthe context that VS codeense is much\nsmaller 65k tokens instead of like the\n200,000 tokens that you get um in in\ncloud code so so that's why they are\nable to offer for these at like 1x\nwithin your VS code copilot subscription\nbecause they're not as effective.\n>> Yeah, but we I'm more I'm more u\nconcerned about your codeex one, not\nclawed. Why why why can't you use codeex\nmax in your copilot chat? Why do you\nhave to install the codeex uh\n>> because it's a different subscription?\n>> But isn't Codex OpenAI\nand isn't and that's owned by Microsoft\npretty much. But I'm paying it's\ndifferent if you pay Microsoft vs code\nand OpenAI is still its own its own\nentity, right? They have a partnership\nand an investment.\n>> Oh, I see. I thought I thought there was\nI I assumed there there'd be some really\ntight integration\n>> because\n>> you know Microsoft is a customer of\nOpenAI like a partner and they get\naccess to some models\n>> because because it is a bit of a like a\nmaze to I mean you must spend half your\nday working out which extension, which\noptimization,\nwhich thing to to use to get the best\nout of your subscription. It's a\nnightmare if you're like a if you're in\nlike a corporate environment, you know,\nI'm not I'm not even allowed to install\nthe extension. I think uh\n>> uh corporate environments I'm not\ntalking about and I'm on a corporate\nlaptop actually, but luckily they have\nnot locked that down. Um and this VS\nCode subscription is through the GitHub\norganization. I I I used to have my own,\nbut I canceled it. Uh and then the\ncompany has seats, right? Um so this one\nis controlled by the company and okay\nand it can see how much each of us is\nusing. This one is my personal codeex\nwhich of obviously if I work on company\num source code that would probably not\nbe acceptable that I am using my\npersonal codeex with like the open eye\nuh plus subscription versus the VS code\nagreed\num like you know part of the GitHub\norganizations we discussed.\n>> Yeah. Um,\n>> I'm just using the chat. Um, but also\nthen you have you need to learn how to\nset up your workflow. I installed this\ncodeex plugin the moment they announced\nit. Like, hey, we have a codeex plugin\nand that's it. Like, I added that in. I\nsaw that I could paste screenshots and I\nwas like, hey, let's, you know, I like\nthat more. And I go between the codec\ncli and the plug-in however I feel like.\nAnd like I said, most of my workflow is\ncloud code. Um, but then sometimes\nbecause I look at my usage here and I\nsay, \"Oops, I'm close to my weekly or\nwhatever.\" Then I start like, \"Can I not\ndo some of these task with Colex\ninstead?\"\n>> Yeah,\n>> I think maybe it was maybe it was like\nsome sort of FUD, but I saw I saw a news\narticle or tweet that that evidently\nOpen AI is giving\nfree AI open AI to to India or something\ncrazy. Did you read that or am I just am\nI just racist? [laughter]\n>> Pl the sixth on both or is it the fifth?\n[laughter]\nUh no, but um that would mean that if I\nre answer it, incriminate myself. That's\nnot what I meant. But anyway, [laughter]\noh yeah, I found it. I found it. Um, I\nmean it's not being I guess I I mean I\nthink it's a little bit unfair to offer\na whole country something that we\nordinarily have to pay for.\n>> Well, how much of you how is your salary\ncompared to I don't think it's unfair.\n>> Oh, for Christ sake. You're going to\nOkay. So, whole India gets open AI.\n>> Why not? [snorts]\n>> Um,\nokay. As long as it's confirmed that\nthey're in India. [laughter]\nYou have to cut that out.\n>> What do you mean? As long as it's\nconfirmed.\n>> No, no, never mind. I didn't say\nanything.\n>> I mean, you should move. I mean, I'm\njust thinking that like in in the in a\ndystopian future that that Vincent moves\nto India just because he's addicted to\nhis uh codec subscription and this is\nthe only way it can be sustainable.\nI don't see it as an addiction. It's\nmore like an ambition. An ambition of\nYeah. It's about upskilling myself,\nbuilding something real, not just like a\ntoy project. And and honestly, I often\nask myself, why do I spend time on doing\nthis when I could just, you know, do my\nwork and then go to the beach in Vietnam\nand kite surf, you know? So, so it's\nmore our ambition because how much like\nhow much time do we have left to um to\nrealize? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's one\nthing. I mean, moving to England two\nyears ago has been a huge culture shock\nto me because there's a lot of people in\nEngland and probably Europe who work\nlike 4 days a week. I'm like, dude,\nyou're in your you're in your freaking\nprime. It's your it's your obligation to\nyour family and to you to work as hard\nas possible to maximize everything so\nthat you can you know retire early if\nanything and then\n>> retire with a broken back and inability\nto walk properly anymore and not enjoy\nthe time with your kids. I mean there's\na there's a there's a good reason why I\nI I really like um Scandinavian\ncountries when I work there because\n>> Oh no. So you're going to tell me no. we\nactually should be working four days a\nweek and that's why we use AI.\n>> Uh\nI mean I'm saying that right. It's a\nflip coin because when COVID finished I\nknow so many of my friends from\nSingapore who were cooked up in you know\nat home decided like that's it you know\nI'm I'm not spending my life working.\nI'm going to go travel for the first\nyear. Some of them took a sabbatical and\nthen all the tech layoff happened and\nthen half of them couldn't find a job\nbecause the market was saturated.\n>> So what are they doing now?\n>> Your friends\n>> panhandling in Bali.\n>> So So the So on one side I I'm saying\nyou should spend your youth with your\nchildren. You should you know you have\nto balance it like work life balance\neven though it's your prime. But I'm\nsaying that and I'm doing the opposite,\n[laughter] right? I'm up in my bed on\non, you know, doing system design\nspecifications from my phone uh or while\nI'm having a coffee outside. Um and I'm\nnot spending enough time, you know,\ndoing the things that I can enjoy right\nnow. Um so yeah, I'm not consistent.\n>> Yeah, it's a difficult topic. the um\nthere's a guy that I've been following\nfor years uh Eddie Osmani. He's he's big\nin the web world and I used to be big in\nthe world. I don't know if I used to do\nstuff for the W3C and and browser\nengines in the beginning of my career\nand I think I'm come across Eddie Osmani\nthen\nand he's still around.\nHe's he's like a a lead at Google and he\nwrote an open he wrote an AI book or\nsomething.\n>> I think I saw I follow several Gemini\nCLI like core team members to find out\nif they are doing some improvements to\nthe product and I think I saw somebody\nshare this like uh Gemini CLI things as\nwell which I was like I'm going to have\nto look at it but then\nI mean most of these are like oh this is\n>> yeah I know about that. you know about\nthat. This is like use Claude\n>> create custom commands. I mean this\n>> create custom commands. Okay. Yeah. Yep.\nWe know about that. I I to be honest I'm\nnot as I pointed out yesterday I don't\nlike things polluting my command space.\nI'd rather use um\nthe way that Claude the way that you\ntrigger an agent or a skill in Claude is\njust by text\nbut via the prompt and it works\nreliably. I I I never get the feeling\nthat oh no it's not triggering the right\nMCP or\n>> that's the weird thing about using these\ntools is that we are used to find menus\nand buttons to click on\n>> whereas right now in words we say\nsomething and that kind of triggers the\nLLM to more like oh\n>> and you can see that it triggered it.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, but the thing is like they\nhave this thing of agents, right? But\nyou don't really know like, oh great,\nthere's agents. And sometimes it's like\ndecides to use it. But you can actually\njust say like, oh, by the way, you know,\nsend off uh an explore agent to go\nthrough the codebase and find wherever\nthis might be applicable and it just\nspawns an agent and does that like\nthere's no button to click,\n>> right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> What's the words that I use to trigger\n>> me? At one time I I used agents to\ndepend a bot merge everything in my in\nmy 300 repos. It worked really well.\nUm, but I I want to kind of tie it into\nthat because I shared with you something\nthat I saw in the change log of cloud\ncode and they said they improved the ask\nuser input tool and I was like oh so\nthat's the thing it's called it's like\nask user question tool to autosubmit\nsingle select questions on the last\nquestion and so\n>> right so so when I saw the name of the\ntool now I suddenly like have maybe like\nson will know that if if the user\nsays something or ask me a question\nabout this, it will automatically change\n>> so you know how to use it. Yeah. Just\n>> there's a lot of learning here like just\nto know when an agent is spinning\nknowing that you're you you can you're\nin plan mode so you can get the prompts\nknowing the dialogue for an MCP call.\n>> There's a lot of learning and\nunlearning.\n>> Okay. because I saw somebody on Reddit\ncomplain like the latest update on the\nplan mode behavior has broken my\nworkflow. And I'm like, yeah, who cares?\nI mean, that's part of of of of your\njob, not only to know how to phrase\nthings to trigger the behavior that you\nwant to see in the model, but also\nrealize that that behavior is no longer\nthe most efficient and change the way\nthat you prompt a model.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, learning and unlearning, which is\nwhy it constantly changes. [snorts] You\nknow, I can see some people struggling\nwith this. I mean, I can see some\nAnyway, so tip three, use your MCP. We\nall know about that stuff.\n>> I think struggling because of the\nnon-determinism, right? Because\nsupposedly everything is perfect and\nwhen you say something, it's going to\nact the way you expect it to work. Yeah.\nThe problem is like what I just noticed\nhere. It's triggering on the tabs being\nin in the Golang file as an indentation\nand then it's it's update tool not\nworking and then it's it sometimes goes\nto our I'm going to do an here do with a\ncat or I'm going to use Python to update\nthe file. Like what? Stop stop.\n>> Yeah, I I mean I can see some people\nstruggling. Maybe I'm just belittling my\nsome of the people I've come in contact\nwith, but uh but I can see [laughter]\n>> be very specific.\n>> I can see some people struggling, but\nmaybe maybe it's a skill we can all\nlearn. Okay, tip four. I think that I\nthink leverage memory addition. So I\nthink I'm I'm when when someone says\nmemory, I'm thinking beads already.\nDo you use do you use slashmemory\n>> and used to be with a hashtag to just\nupdate the cloud MD file I think but\nthey might have changed that. So the\nthing about beats is exactly the thing\nlike before right at some point if cloud\ncode shell is so much better than beats\nI must be able to get rid of it quickly.\nSo if if if it's tricking up my LLM more\nthan it's helping I need to be able to\nremove it right.\nAnd regarding memory, I mean I remember\nwhen a long time ago you would say\nsomething like uh please remember to do\nthis always. Then it it would\nautomatically pick that up and feedback\nlike hey if you put the hashtag it will\nautomatically write it to the cloud MD\nfile and then the slashmemory was\nsupposed to be something similar but\nmaybe they've updated it, right? I don't\nknow that.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And and this is for Gemini, right? This\nis not for cloud code.\n>> Check restore as an undo button. Um,\n>> that's also again is just a double\nescape.\n>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Then you get the menu\nand you can choose. Yeah.\n>> I use it a few times actually. It's I\nlove it.\n>> This applies to Claude. Uh, well, tip\nsix it read Google Docs.\nUm, I think Claude Claude Claude desktop\ncould do this. I noticed that it\nintegrates quite well in my\n>> actually Opus 4.5 has been significantly\nimproved around um doing those\nmultiflows where it goes across\ndocuments. I never do that because I do\ncoding task and I don't have to deal\nwith Google Docs but a lot of the\nentropic examples on their blog post\nrelated to Opus 4.5 is the token you the\ntoken usage effectiveness of Opus 4.5\nwhen doing these tasks. Um, and\n>> the whole MCP drama that is now because\nEntropic created it and now they're\nsaying, \"Well, we don't do MCPS like\nthat anymore.\" You can actually hint on\nyour tools um with information about how\nto use the tool in a script so that Opus\nwill write a script to use the tools to\nthen execute everything in one go.\nThat's one of the things like I I joked\nabout yesterday with like on Facebook\nwas like everybody wrote these MTPs with\nall these tools. Now you have to go and\nupdate them all because now you have to\ngo and indicate how to use that tool in\na script for\n>> open. Yeah, I saw your I saw your\nLinkedIn thing.\n>> Yeah, the the we talked about playright\nbefore, but every time I use playright\nat work, the the token limit gets gets\nexceeded and then it does that horrible\ncompacting uh phase which I've now\nturned off. So I don't know what's going\nto happen now that I've turned it off\nthanks to you. Does it just stop?\nThe thing about MC about playright right\nI think this MCP server is is is wrong.\nIt's not good design because\n>> it's like one of the one of the what do\nyou call it flagship MCPS but carry on.\nWell, to me\nafter after adding playright scripts to\nmy my you know my API with a with a web\napp to go through the flows user flows\nyou know login get redirected to\nkeycloak um sign in get back to the app\nthen validate that you can do this but\nnot that if depending on your group\nmembership and things like that these\ntype of user flows very hard to test\nwith uh integration testing golang or\nsomething like that right because you\nneed to parse the respon from keycloak\nto find the the the session token or the\nwhatever it's complicated. So um after\nbuilding those playrights flows I was\nreally impressed with pay playright\nbecause what you get is a full trace of\nscreenshots context like this is what\nwhat the it has like this YAML\nrepresentation of a web page of the tree\nof the like the DOM the document object\nmodel of what are the different elements\nand how they're nested and what their ID\n>> how do you see this YAML does it spit it\nout\n>> you see it also if you if you use the\ndev tools Chrome MCP when you're doing\nlike you wanted to investigate some\nproblem in your web app, it can launch\nChrome, which is way lighter than the\nthan than the than Playright itself\nbecause Playright requires a plug-in,\nbut Chrome can run on its own with the\nChrome MCP. So, I like that one. And it\ncan launch it and then the LLM will say,\nokay, I take a snapshot and it shows you\nlike a YAML document tree. And then when\nyou uh when it sees like let me check\nthe response from the API server. It\ngoes to the JavaScript console in the\nbrowser and runs a small script that\nuses the React app state and um does a\nquery like hey I have this session token\nand everything and then boom it it does\nthe query from within the console which\nis way more powerful than what you can\ndo just within the terminal right so so\nthis type of actions amazing for like\nlive troubleshoot yes it's going to eat\nyour tokens and I think they [snorts]\nmade some as well\n>> I use playright with a a brow an\nexisting browser so that has all my\ntokens and all that stuff I But then\nwhat I what I think the mistake is of\nthis MCP a playright MCP server to drive\na browser which is like send the message\nuh to the browser get the response then\nsend the whole conversation to the API\nto then generate the next step which is\nyour context window then send a message\nto the browser get the response append\nit then send the whole thing\n>> I agree it's a it's a nightmare it's a\nnightmare\n>> right so what I think makes the most\nsense is like the execution logic of\nopus which is you have a stra a trace\nyou kick off the playright flow and and\nactually within the playright browser\nwindow you get that next to the error\nwhere it happens like hey I'm supposed\nto see this button but it's never\nvisible and I time out then it gives you\nlike this error and you can click uh\ncopy prompt and you can paste it into\ninto your model and it says like you are\nworking on this problem this is the\nplayright test this is source file this\nis the this is the snapshot of the\nbrowser context and this is the error\nmessage that that that we're stuck on\nand then the whole context is there.\nThat's like much better than like do\nthis then do this, then do this, then do\nthis, do this, and send the conversation\nover the whole time. You get the whole\nflow and you know, you run through it.\nThat's exactly the idea of Opus, right?\nYou run through a process. You put the\n>> So, so wait a minute. Is this a solved I\ndon't really understand. Is this a\nsolved problem with with Opus or is this\n>> Yeah, the the big innovator of Opus is\nthat it identifies like how to chain\nseveral tool calls and then run them and\nthen get like send\n>> I need to I need to try this. I'm\nstruggling.\n>> So that's why they say Opus is way more\ntoken efficient. Opus 4.5 is way more\ntoken efficient and bottom line cheaper\nthan Sun 4.5. So if you can if the model\ncan really be efficient with its tokens,\nbut it has to fit the use case. I think\n>> I thought we started the conversation\nsaying that the playright MCP sucks. So\nit the playright MCP can just stay as it\nis and Opus can basically compensate.\n>> The playright MCP is the wrong tool\nbecause it's going to send your\nconversation across every time the whole\ncontext window, right? It's going to do\nan X tool execution, get a little bit\nmore appended to the context, send\neverything over and then send back uh\nresponse tokens appended.\n>> But how do I set up?\n>> So MCP server is bad. The actual ability\nto run traces and capture the trace is\ngood because that's the concept of a\nfull execution and get the result of\nthat execution, not do every individual\ncall and send the conversation over\nevery time. You see the difference,\nright?\n>> Yeah. But what are what are my practical\nsteps to get my playright flows more\nefficient then use opus?\nUh\nwell so what you said earlier was kind\nof correct because you said like opus\nwill fix it because it should be able to\nchange the chain those MCP tool calls uh\nand then do the whole flow and get the\noutput. I have I don't know that. But\nwhat I do know\n>> is I got to have a play\n>> the playright uh tracing capability and\nusing the MCP with current model doesn't\ndoesn't work that way for me. Okay.\n>> But it would be interesting to know if\nif OPUS is therefore like what you said.\nSo Opus solved that. Right. Maybe it is\nright.\n>> Let's let's let's carry on looking\nthrough this thing. Do I I to be honest\nI don't use the ad symbol anymore\nbecause every time I press it it\nlaunches UI. I just I just paste the\nrelative path.\n>> Is this for Gemini?\n>> Yeah. But I think the same works this\nworks in Claude I think.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But in cloud it just\nlike drops down the file list and then\nyou just tap complete the file and then\nit kind of like sends the\n>> I'm used to like copying relative path\nfrom VS Code and just pasting it in. So\nfor a while and I'm not sure who I think\nit's Gemini doing this when you relative\ncopy relative path when you paste in\nGemini it adds the add some symbol on\nits own.\n>> Oh really?\n>> In the in the Gemini CLI. Yes. So if you\ncopy a relative file it actually like\ncreates it as include this file in in\nthe in the in the query because you're\ngoing to need it anyway which I don't\nfully agree with. Sometimes I I remove\nthe ad sign and I say and go through\nthis file bit by bit if you need it like\nsearch for these strings and then go\nthrough it. I don't want to send the\nwhole file, right?\n>> Uh\ncuz I have a feeling you're I mean this\nto me here is an anti pattern because\nlike\n>> the minute I do something like this I\nfeel AI is just going to do some really\ncrazy answer. Like I feel like some\npeople,\nokay, I'm not I'm not trying to I'm not\ntrying to I'm not trying to like\nidentify my my colleagues, but some\npeople don't know about diff\n>> and it's kind of scary\n>> and like they should be using diff to\nsee the changes. They should not be\ndoing something like this.\n>> I I was going to say the biggest problem\nthere is the extension. It's it's a\nPython file. [laughter]\n>> Okay, next. On the-fly tool creation.\nWhat the hell is that?\nUm,\n>> don't know. I don't know what that Do.\nYou know what that is? Sorry, my\nmother's up. It can use its coding\nabilities to fabricate new ones as\nneeded.\n>> Oh, I think I think I think it's like\ncreating\nOh, yeah. Like in in\n>> write a Python script to parse it. Yeah,\nlike Claude skills has this has this uh\n>> directory where you dump in scripts\nwhich can help it do its thing. I think\nit's it's alluding to that.\n>> Yeah. And which is I think very valid.\nUm which which is kind of like related\nto the blog post again, right? Where\nwhere they can they can create the\nscripts to do the work and then you know\njust put the pass in the input and then\nsee the output without having to you\nknow pass the full context across each\ntime. And so you save tokens that way.\nYeah.\n>> Use Gemini CLI. Okay. It's just like\nusing YOLO mode. Okay. This is all\nboring stuff.\nI I never do things like this. I don't\n>> I haven't but like\n>> I know about it.\n>> Speckit. I thought speckit had some\nscenarios where it told inside the\nprompt to say give me sub agent prompt.\nCharlie.\nCharlie.\n>> Okay,\nhold on. Oh god. Unfortunately, this is\nthe time I need to help my kids get to\nschool.\n>> Yeah. Anyway, I thought thought it was a\ngood chat.

It\n[0:11] says you're on the you're seeing the\n[0:13] free plan because I'm using the cloud\n[0:15] API.\n[0:20] So if I go to settings usage.\n[0:25] Okay. No, I guess. So yeah, long story\n[0:28] short, I'm I've used $80 this month.\n[0:32] >> 80?\n[0:34] >> Yeah. Is that good?\n[0:35] >> That's a lot more than me, bro. You\n[0:36] always keep saying, \"How can I use so\n[0:38] much AI credits?\" And now you're using a\n[0:40] lot more. [laughter]\n[0:42] >> So if I But I I'm pretty sure that I\n[0:45] looked at Claude yesterday. You talked\n[0:48] about trust and um about trusting the\n[0:51] code. Now you have seven, but that's\n[0:53] your VS Code spend. That's different,\n[0:55] right? That's not your cloud.\n[0:59] That's GitHub. Yeah.\n[1:04] But how much?\n[1:06] >> You have no budget.\n[1:08] >> But still, it makes it look like I've\n[1:10] got 75% premium requests used.\n[1:17] >> I I just don't understand it. I mean,\n[1:19] how if I can't understand\n[1:21] how I'm spending money\n[1:24] on\n[1:26] AI? Yeah. So, it basically kind of\n[1:28] shocked me because if I'm like, if you\n[1:31] had to How much are you spending on AI\n[1:33] right now? Then\n[1:35] I pay Well, I'm always confused between\n[1:38] Singapore dollars and US dollars. I\n[1:40] think what I'm seeing is Singapore\n[1:42] dollars 30 for an entropic monthly\n[1:44] subscription. and I added another 30 in\n[1:47] my wallet with a $20 monthly cap. So in\n[1:50] total if I I spend everything I I I'd\n[1:53] hit 50 if it's in dollars 50 and then\n[1:58] and just just to\n[1:59] >> screen froze.\n[2:01] >> Yeah, it's frozen for me too. Hold on.\n[2:03] Let me see if I can just switch to my\n[2:07] >> You're in a\n[2:08] >> FaceTime camera.\n[2:09] >> Funny pose.\n[2:12] I I like to use the my my uh my phone\n[2:16] because the quality is so much better.\n[2:18] >> Okay. That was 50 on Antropic, right? Um\n[2:22] when you\n[2:24] >> Yeah. So, sorry when I said you spend 80\n[2:26] is more than me. I did not take into\n[2:27] account Chad GPT and uh Gemini U\n[2:31] subscriptions.\n[2:32] >> So, you're spending you're spending like\n[2:34] 100. The the scary thing is is like I'm\n[2:37] like if if my employer said, \"Oh, Kai,\n[2:40] you're spending too much on Claude.\n[2:42] We're not going to finance your $80.\" I\n[2:45] feel like it's the same thing with AWS\n[2:47] because I have my own AWS account just\n[2:50] for like learning and doing things.\n[2:53] And that cost me like 30 bucks a month\n[2:56] because I can't get it lower than that\n[2:59] because I've loaded up with some S3. So,\n[3:01] I'm just I'm I'm a little bit worried\n[3:02] that as a as a worker that I have to\n[3:05] take on these costs and like my wife\n[3:08] like bemonones me about our Netflix and\n[3:10] all these other subscriptions if if we\n[3:13] all if if I have to maintain an AI\n[3:15] subscription of 100 bucks a month. I\n[3:18] mean, is that is it's a bit annoying,\n[3:20] but I guess it's worth it. But,\n[3:24] >> bucks is Yeah,\n[3:25] >> 100 bucks is something but like it's\n[3:26] worth it. I mean I do feel I do feel\n[3:30] energized and\n[3:32] >> and motivated to get things done with\n[3:34] with the help of AI you know never mind\n[3:36] it like completing my code like the\n[3:39] planning everything it really really\n[3:41] helps at least me\n[3:43] >> never mind it also taking on a funny\n[3:45] thing right I was installing posgress on\n[3:47] an EC2 instance in the Singapore AWS\n[3:50] region and it was taking a very long\n[3:53] time it looked like it was hanging I was\n[3:55] using a packer build script right\n[3:56] supposedly completely finishes in 15\n[3:58] minutes but just adding Postgress now it\n[4:00] was like hanging for 10 minutes before\n[4:01] it even like finished the Postgress\n[4:03] installation which I put early in the\n[4:05] installation process [gasps] and after\n[4:07] troubleshooting it with AI for a while\n[4:09] it just said well you know we looked we\n[4:11] we signed in we had package generate a\n[4:14] separate uh debug SSH key so I could log\n[4:16] in to see to monitor the progress and we\n[4:18] we concluded that the the transfer was\n[4:21] just slow because we're downloading from\n[4:22] like universal DBN packages and Um, and\n[4:27] so it suggested a couple of mirrors, but\n[4:29] then we had to validate because the\n[4:31] machine was ARM and not all mirrors\n[4:32] support ARM packages.\n[4:34] >> And so it did some latency like we ended\n[4:38] up writing a latency checker for the\n[4:41] several um Singapore\n[4:43] >> mirrors available for like DBN ports or\n[4:46] whatever. And I ended up with like um\n[4:49] and and then there was a an edge case\n[4:52] where one of the mirrors maintenance\n[4:54] page show that they were no longer\n[4:56] supported but according to the benchmark\n[4:58] results had like a sub millisecond\n[5:00] latency which turned out to be a treat a\n[5:02] redirect to an error page and so it\n[5:04] didn't validate the the actual binary\n[5:06] contents of of the package that was\n[5:08] supposed to be there. Right. So it just\n[5:10] Yeah. So it it responded 200. Okay. But\n[5:12] the actual contents of the index was an\n[5:15] error page.\n[5:16] >> Yeah. So, so then we ended up with like\n[5:17] a whole a whole script to validate\n[5:20] mirrors for Ubuntu package for DBN\n[5:22] packages that are ARM compatible. Uh\n[5:25] well, any compatible because it checked\n[5:26] the architecture of the of the u of the\n[5:29] the kernel, right? So, so just to say\n[5:31] like yes, AI is so exciting, but as part\n[5:34] of my process, I ended up writing a\n[5:37] benchmark script for [laughter] the\n[5:38] Singapore.\n[5:39] >> Yeah, you get nice little surprises and\n[5:41] bonuses and and all sorts of artifacts\n[5:45] out of it.\n[5:47] Oh my gosh. So,\n[5:50] >> finished.\n[5:50] >> I want you to pick up on with on you on\n[5:52] the um\n[5:55] Sorry, I lost my train of thought. I'm\n[5:57] just I'm just I'm just kind of like I\n[6:00] don't know. I'm just like [snorts]\n[6:02] >> It's too early.\n[6:04] >> Yeah, it is a bit early. Yeah. I'm just\n[6:06] thinking that like how how much is AI\n[6:08] worth to me? It's like it's now just\n[6:10] it's now undeniable. I cannot live\n[6:13] without it. I'm just a little bit sad\n[6:15] about it.\n[6:16] >> It's funny because originally I had like\n[6:18] these these talks and panel discussions\n[6:22] and everyone agreed like we we we do a a\n[6:24] Friday, no AI Friday to make sure that\n[6:27] our muscles are still being exercised. I\n[6:30] haven't even thought about that in the\n[6:31] last four months to consider no AI\n[6:34] Friday cuz [sighs]\n[6:36] >> are we are we addicts? Are we I mean you\n[6:38] talk about your supply all the time. I'm\n[6:41] talking how I can't live without it. Are\n[6:43] we\n[6:45] addicted to AI?\n[6:50] Sad is it? I don't think it's sad. I\n[6:53] think the amount of output and I don't\n[6:55] think it's illusionary output as well. I\n[6:58] think it's real output. there's a 100%\n[7:01] sure that I couldn't do what I've built\n[7:03] today without the assistance\n[7:06] uh and also the motivation that it gives\n[7:08] you you know because no matter what you\n[7:10] come up with it will come up with like\n[7:11] something that looks plausible and once\n[7:13] and then some cause fallacy once you're\n[7:15] down the the road you just persist until\n[7:18] it's there and then you need AI to get\n[7:20] you out\n[7:23] um yeah but but when I was saying costs\n[7:26] for AI and I think like entertainment\n[7:28] subscription is similar Right. Actually,\n[7:31] like my chip is the good thing about\n[7:33] OpenAI is it's completely shared with my\n[7:35] family. Maybe it's not good that my son\n[7:36] is using it all the time because he's\n[7:38] literally giving like verbatim\n[7:41] assignments like here's a story analyzed\n[7:44] for literature like\n[7:45] >> yeah I got I got my wife using Claude\n[7:49] >> and she\n[7:51] the interesting thing she said yesterday\n[7:53] in the car [clears throat] was that she\n[7:56] wanted to cancel it but then she said to\n[7:57] me because I think Gemini does the same\n[8:00] thing but then I asked Gemini a question\n[8:03] and it completely messed it\n[8:05] and Gemini got it really right. Um, and\n[8:07] Claude got it right. So now I'm thinking\n[8:09] I shouldn't cancel the subscription. I\n[8:11] was going, \"Yeah, maybe you should keep\n[8:13] Claude.\"\n[8:14] >> I subscribed Gemini last month when I I\n[8:17] was I think it was a bug with OpenAI\n[8:19] when they did the release. That's it\n[8:21] showed like that you had used all your\n[8:22] budget at some point. It displayed that\n[8:24] all the time. So, I was out of codeex\n[8:26] and cloud and I was like, well, I really\n[8:31] want to like continue and I was hoping\n[8:34] betting on Gemini 3 coming out anyway.\n[8:36] So, I was like, I might as well, you\n[8:38] know, subscribe to that while I'm at it\n[8:39] with the intention to cancel it if it\n[8:41] wasn't worth it. And I think I should\n[8:43] cancel it\n[8:45] >> Yeah. But it's the same thing like I\n[8:47] have Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon\n[8:49] Prime. I mean, honestly, Amazon Prime is\n[8:52] very small amount.\n[8:54] >> Mhm. Um, and and\n[8:56] >> yeah, yeah, Amazon Prime is the\n[8:58] cheapest.\n[8:59] >> Yeah.\n[8:59] >> Yeah. And yeah,\n[9:02] >> Disney Plus, I think I want to cancel it\n[9:03] because the most expensive and honestly\n[9:05] the output is so bad.\n[9:06] >> What What about cloud services like like\n[9:08] AWS? I mean, you must have like a $30 a\n[9:11] month type thing that I do.\n[9:14] >> Oh, yeah. I um I do have an AWS account.\n[9:17] I think it's something around that. I\n[9:19] have a CDM for the project which is\n[9:23] backed by static S3. I have no like it's\n[9:26] all serverless. I don't even use\n[9:27] lambdas. It's all static basically. Um\n[9:30] just the route 53 uh the TLS like the\n[9:34] certificates.\n[9:35] Um but the TLS is free, right? But it's\n[9:38] also the\n[9:40] uh what's it? Well, the CloudFront\n[9:42] distribution itself. Uh what else? uh\n[9:45] the the the route 53 like domain\n[9:48] registration because I do have some\n[9:49] domains via namecheep but I think it's\n[9:51] so much easier to just go through AWS\n[9:53] and like the cost difference make it\n[9:55] like\n[9:57] building\n[9:57] >> account I guess the $30 a month I mean\n[10:00] I'm aggregating it but it's because I\n[10:02] maintain\n[10:04] you know eight domains that I've never\n[10:06] really used in my life but I still pay\n[10:08] for them because I'm an idiot. So this\n[10:10] this this topic will be like how to like\n[10:14] all of the useless stuff we pay for.\n[10:16] [laughter]\n[10:16] >> Yeah, something like that.\n[10:19] Um, sorry, I'm still trying to gather my\n[10:21] thoughts. There was something I wanted\n[10:23] to chat to you about. Um\n[10:27] yeah, you you mentioned that like\n[10:28] switching to plan you you don't use plan\n[10:31] mode anymore like I I\n[10:34] >> so so because planning is like under the\n[10:38] spec kit where it creates a detailed\n[10:41] multihase and then boils it down to each\n[10:44] individual file exactly what needs to\n[10:45] change.\n[10:46] >> Oh this is because you spec it right?\n[10:47] You don't need plan what you're saying.\n[10:49] So now if I like initially when I did\n[10:51] that I went into cloud and as usual fire\n[10:54] up plan mode to create like a bunch of\n[10:55] to-do items and then read the spec but\n[10:58] what I found is that cloud sometimes\n[11:00] just changes the plan like even though\n[11:02] the task description are clear this is\n[11:04] what you need to do in this file and it\n[11:06] just goes and does something slightly\n[11:07] different and then in the overall design\n[11:09] things don't work anymore. I I've seen\n[11:11] cloud do that. So I'm actually now cloud\n[11:14] code plan mode is detrimental to my\n[11:17] >> that doesn't sound good at all.\n[11:20] I'm I'm plan mode. I'm plan mode all the\n[11:23] way, man.\n[11:24] >> That's why you start, right? But I've\n[11:25] also the reason why I sent you that\n[11:27] message is because I saw two or three\n[11:28] threads on Reddit uh yesterday because\n[11:30] with the new Opus 4.5 release, they also\n[11:33] revised the way plan works and they said\n[11:35] for Opus even it's worse because now OPU\n[11:37] spends up spins up sub agents and then\n[11:40] works off summary results and as a\n[11:43] result doesn't get like as good a um a\n[11:47] plan anymore. So people are complaining\n[11:49] that\n[11:50] >> is like a a better planning model, isn't\n[11:53] it?\n[11:54] >> Yes. But it spins up sub aents to\n[11:56] explore the codebase and then works off\n[11:58] those results which are inaccurate.\n[12:01] So if if you were to use Opus, which is\n[12:03] a more expensive per token cost,\n[12:05] >> you get more you get other things you\n[12:07] don't want with it. Is that is that what\n[12:09] you're saying?\n[12:10] >> No. No. If you were to use Opus, which\n[12:12] is like very more expensive per token,\n[12:14] uh it would itself read and understand\n[12:17] everything and then make a make a plan\n[12:18] out of it, right? But because they're\n[12:20] trying to save cost, they are like\n[12:23] having Opus more as the orchestrator\n[12:24] spinning up sub agents that go and read\n[12:26] things then create summaries and then\n[12:29] feeds that back to Opus. As a result,\n[12:31] those summaries are not as accurate and\n[12:33] Opus makes incorrect plans. That's the\n[12:36] complaints that I read on Reddit um\n[12:38] today and and I was like actually it's\n[12:40] not a problem for me because I'm not\n[12:42] even using plan mode anymore. Even\n[12:44] before the update, I already noticed\n[12:46] that there was something wrong with it.\n[12:48] >> In in your screencast you you shared\n[12:50] with me there's something else that I\n[12:53] didn't quite understand or I haven't\n[12:55] seen before. You using anti-gravity, I\n[12:57] guess, right?\n[12:58] >> I'm using what? Sorry.\n[12:59] >> You were using anti-gravity.\n[13:01] >> Anti-gravity. Yeah. Yeah, there was this\n[13:02] workflow thing that I had.\n[13:04] >> Yeah, but like you were choosing there\n[13:05] was an option down by the model where\n[13:07] you were choosing if it was like\n[13:09] >> Oh, that's high, medium, or low\n[13:11] reasoning or something.\n[13:13] >> Oh, that's a that's a codeex plugin. No.\n[13:16] >> Oh, can you just show that? Like what?\n[13:17] Why? Why would you\n[13:21] >> twiggle that toggle?\n[13:24] >> Uh, which one is it? This one.\n[13:29] >> Yeah. Can you just zoom in down there?\n[13:32] So to see your\n[13:33] >> how would I zoom in? I can do this. Is\n[13:36] that zooming in?\n[13:37] >> Um Oh, I thought you might use the the\n[13:40] Apple zoom which is like I don't know\n[13:43] what I think you have to enable\n[13:45] >> but you can read it, right?\n[13:46] >> Yeah. Yeah, it's good. But\n[13:48] >> the setup is to put on your VS code your\n[13:50] chat window on the right on this right\n[13:52] sidebar.\n[13:53] >> Yeah.\n[13:53] >> And by default you will get your co your\n[13:56] Visual Studio Code\n[13:57] >> um here. Right. And you can choose\n[14:00] codeex. Yeah,\n[14:01] >> those are the ones that you get with\n[14:02] your your co-pilot subscription.\n[14:05] >> Yeah, and I'm locked into 4.5, that's\n[14:07] for sure.\n[14:08] >> I mean, um,\n[14:09] >> and then\n[14:10] >> I have installed another plugin here\n[14:13] which is called Codeex.\n[14:16] So, I have the the cloud code plugin,\n[14:18] but I also have the codeex plugin, the\n[14:20] OpenAI codeex. Where is it?\n[14:22] >> Yeah, it was up the top there. I think\n[14:23] it was at the top. Uh,\n[14:26] >> this one.\n[14:26] >> Yeah. So when I I started using codeex\n[14:29] through this CLI um it was horrible\n[14:31] because you couldn't paste screenshots.\n[14:33] It was really bad compared to cloud code\n[14:35] right. So I installed this plugin and\n[14:37] here you can put images you can easily\n[14:40] refer to files things that the CLI don't\n[14:43] really has properly and down here when\n[14:45] you select the model that's where then\n[14:47] you can now access with your I have chv\n[14:50] plus right $20 a month I can access now\n[14:53] in my VS code through that subscription\n[14:57] GPT 5.1 codeex with high reasoning I\n[15:00] think it's a promotion they're trying to\n[15:01] see how well the model does\n[15:03] >> I don't understand why why couldn't the\n[15:04] the co-pilot chat expose 5.1 C codeex\n[15:08] max. So this is something also I just\n[15:11] read on on uh on Reddit the other day\n[15:13] was people asking like what's the\n[15:15] difference between running Sun 4.5 here\n[15:18] and running cloud code son here in the\n[15:20] in the terminal I can run them both\n[15:22] right and one of the comments and I\n[15:24] don't know if this is verified said that\n[15:26] the context that VS codeense is much\n[15:29] smaller 65k tokens instead of like the\n[15:33] 200,000 tokens that you get um in in\n[15:35] cloud code so so that's why they are\n[15:38] able to offer for these at like 1x\n[15:41] within your VS code copilot subscription\n[15:44] because they're not as effective.\n[15:45] >> Yeah, but we I'm more I'm more u\n[15:48] concerned about your codeex one, not\n[15:51] clawed. Why why why can't you use codeex\n[15:53] max in your copilot chat? Why do you\n[15:56] have to install the codeex uh\n[15:59] >> because it's a different subscription?\n[16:02] >> But isn't Codex OpenAI\n[16:05] and isn't and that's owned by Microsoft\n[16:07] pretty much. But I'm paying it's\n[16:09] different if you pay Microsoft vs code\n[16:11] and OpenAI is still its own its own\n[16:14] entity, right? They have a partnership\n[16:15] and an investment.\n[16:16] >> Oh, I see. I thought I thought there was\n[16:18] I I assumed there there'd be some really\n[16:21] tight integration\n[16:23] >> because\n[16:23] >> you know Microsoft is a customer of\n[16:25] OpenAI like a partner and they get\n[16:27] access to some models\n[16:28] >> because because it is a bit of a like a\n[16:31] maze to I mean you must spend half your\n[16:34] day working out which extension, which\n[16:38] optimization,\n[16:39] which thing to to use to get the best\n[16:42] out of your subscription. It's a\n[16:44] nightmare if you're like a if you're in\n[16:46] like a corporate environment, you know,\n[16:48] I'm not I'm not even allowed to install\n[16:50] the extension. I think uh\n[16:52] >> uh corporate environments I'm not\n[16:54] talking about and I'm on a corporate\n[16:55] laptop actually, but luckily they have\n[16:58] not locked that down. Um and this VS\n[17:01] Code subscription is through the GitHub\n[17:04] organization. I I I used to have my own,\n[17:06] but I canceled it. Uh and then the\n[17:08] company has seats, right? Um so this one\n[17:11] is controlled by the company and okay\n[17:13] and it can see how much each of us is\n[17:14] using. This one is my personal codeex\n[17:17] which of obviously if I work on company\n[17:20] um source code that would probably not\n[17:22] be acceptable that I am using my\n[17:25] personal codeex with like the open eye\n[17:28] uh plus subscription versus the VS code\n[17:31] agreed\n[17:33] um like you know part of the GitHub\n[17:35] organizations we discussed.\n[17:37] >> Yeah. Um,\n[17:38] >> I'm just using the chat. Um, but also\n[17:41] then you have you need to learn how to\n[17:43] set up your workflow. I installed this\n[17:45] codeex plugin the moment they announced\n[17:46] it. Like, hey, we have a codeex plugin\n[17:48] and that's it. Like, I added that in. I\n[17:51] saw that I could paste screenshots and I\n[17:52] was like, hey, let's, you know, I like\n[17:54] that more. And I go between the codec\n[17:56] cli and the plug-in however I feel like.\n[17:58] And like I said, most of my workflow is\n[18:01] cloud code. Um, but then sometimes\n[18:04] because I look at my usage here and I\n[18:06] say, \"Oops, I'm close to my weekly or\n[18:08] whatever.\" Then I start like, \"Can I not\n[18:10] do some of these task with Colex\n[18:11] instead?\"\n[18:12] >> Yeah,\n[18:13] >> I think maybe it was maybe it was like\n[18:15] some sort of FUD, but I saw I saw a news\n[18:20] article or tweet that that evidently\n[18:22] Open AI is giving\n[18:26] free AI open AI to to India or something\n[18:29] crazy. Did you read that or am I just am\n[18:32] I just racist? [laughter]\n[18:36] >> Pl the sixth on both or is it the fifth?\n[18:38] [laughter]\n[18:39] Uh no, but um that would mean that if I\n[18:43] re answer it, incriminate myself. That's\n[18:45] not what I meant. But anyway, [laughter]\n[18:47] oh yeah, I found it. I found it. Um, I\n[18:51] mean it's not being I guess I I mean I\n[18:54] think it's a little bit unfair to offer\n[18:57] a whole country something that we\n[18:59] ordinarily have to pay for.\n[19:01] >> Well, how much of you how is your salary\n[19:03] compared to I don't think it's unfair.\n[19:06] >> Oh, for Christ sake. You're going to\n[19:09] Okay. So, whole India gets open AI.\n[19:12] >> Why not? [snorts]\n[19:13] >> Um,\n[19:17] okay. As long as it's confirmed that\n[19:19] they're in India. [laughter]\n[19:21] You have to cut that out.\n[19:24] >> What do you mean? As long as it's\n[19:25] confirmed.\n[19:27] >> No, no, never mind. I didn't say\n[19:28] anything.\n[19:28] >> I mean, you should move. I mean, I'm\n[19:31] just thinking that like in in the in a\n[19:33] dystopian future that that Vincent moves\n[19:36] to India just because he's addicted to\n[19:38] his uh codec subscription and this is\n[19:42] the only way it can be sustainable.\n[19:46] I don't see it as an addiction. It's\n[19:48] more like an ambition. An ambition of\n[19:51] Yeah. It's about upskilling myself,\n[19:54] building something real, not just like a\n[19:56] toy project. And and honestly, I often\n[20:00] ask myself, why do I spend time on doing\n[20:02] this when I could just, you know, do my\n[20:06] work and then go to the beach in Vietnam\n[20:08] and kite surf, you know? So, so it's\n[20:12] more our ambition because how much like\n[20:15] how much time do we have left to um to\n[20:19] realize? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's one\n[20:22] thing. I mean, moving to England two\n[20:24] years ago has been a huge culture shock\n[20:27] to me because there's a lot of people in\n[20:29] England and probably Europe who work\n[20:32] like 4 days a week. I'm like, dude,\n[20:34] you're in your you're in your freaking\n[20:36] prime. It's your it's your obligation to\n[20:39] your family and to you to work as hard\n[20:42] as possible to maximize everything so\n[20:45] that you can you know retire early if\n[20:48] anything and then\n[20:49] >> retire with a broken back and inability\n[20:51] to walk properly anymore and not enjoy\n[20:54] the time with your kids. I mean there's\n[20:56] a there's a there's a good reason why I\n[20:58] I I really like um Scandinavian\n[21:00] countries when I work there because\n[21:02] >> Oh no. So you're going to tell me no. we\n[21:04] actually should be working four days a\n[21:05] week and that's why we use AI.\n[21:08] >> Uh\n[21:10] I mean I'm saying that right. It's a\n[21:14] flip coin because when COVID finished I\n[21:16] know so many of my friends from\n[21:18] Singapore who were cooked up in you know\n[21:21] at home decided like that's it you know\n[21:23] I'm I'm not spending my life working.\n[21:25] I'm going to go travel for the first\n[21:27] year. Some of them took a sabbatical and\n[21:29] then all the tech layoff happened and\n[21:31] then half of them couldn't find a job\n[21:33] because the market was saturated.\n[21:35] >> So what are they doing now?\n[21:37] >> Your friends\n[21:39] >> panhandling in Bali.\n[21:42] >> So So the So on one side I I'm saying\n[21:46] you should spend your youth with your\n[21:48] children. You should you know you have\n[21:50] to balance it like work life balance\n[21:53] even though it's your prime. But I'm\n[21:55] saying that and I'm doing the opposite,\n[21:57] [laughter] right? I'm up in my bed on\n[22:00] on, you know, doing system design\n[22:02] specifications from my phone uh or while\n[22:05] I'm having a coffee outside. Um and I'm\n[22:08] not spending enough time, you know,\n[22:09] doing the things that I can enjoy right\n[22:11] now. Um so yeah, I'm not consistent.\n[22:16] >> Yeah, it's a difficult topic. the um\n[22:21] there's a guy that I've been following\n[22:22] for years uh Eddie Osmani. He's he's big\n[22:25] in the web world and I used to be big in\n[22:27] the world. I don't know if I used to do\n[22:29] stuff for the W3C and and browser\n[22:32] engines in the beginning of my career\n[22:34] and I think I'm come across Eddie Osmani\n[22:37] then\n[22:39] and he's still around.\n[22:42] He's he's like a a lead at Google and he\n[22:46] wrote an open he wrote an AI book or\n[22:48] something.\n[22:49] >> I think I saw I follow several Gemini\n[22:52] CLI like core team members to find out\n[22:54] if they are doing some improvements to\n[22:56] the product and I think I saw somebody\n[22:59] share this like uh Gemini CLI things as\n[23:02] well which I was like I'm going to have\n[23:04] to look at it but then\n[23:06] I mean most of these are like oh this is\n[23:09] >> yeah I know about that. you know about\n[23:11] that. This is like use Claude\n[23:15] >> create custom commands. I mean this\n[23:17] >> create custom commands. Okay. Yeah. Yep.\n[23:19] We know about that. I I to be honest I'm\n[23:21] not as I pointed out yesterday I don't\n[23:23] like things polluting my command space.\n[23:28] I'd rather use um\n[23:32] the way that Claude the way that you\n[23:34] trigger an agent or a skill in Claude is\n[23:37] just by text\n[23:39] but via the prompt and it works\n[23:41] reliably. I I I never get the feeling\n[23:44] that oh no it's not triggering the right\n[23:47] MCP or\n[23:48] >> that's the weird thing about using these\n[23:50] tools is that we are used to find menus\n[23:53] and buttons to click on\n[23:55] >> whereas right now in words we say\n[23:58] something and that kind of triggers the\n[24:00] LLM to more like oh\n[24:01] >> and you can see that it triggered it.\n[24:04] >> Yeah. Yeah, but the thing is like they\n[24:06] have this thing of agents, right? But\n[24:08] you don't really know like, oh great,\n[24:09] there's agents. And sometimes it's like\n[24:11] decides to use it. But you can actually\n[24:13] just say like, oh, by the way, you know,\n[24:15] send off uh an explore agent to go\n[24:18] through the codebase and find wherever\n[24:20] this might be applicable and it just\n[24:22] spawns an agent and does that like\n[24:24] there's no button to click,\n[24:26] >> right?\n[24:26] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[24:26] >> What's the words that I use to trigger\n[24:28] >> me? At one time I I used agents to\n[24:32] depend a bot merge everything in my in\n[24:34] my 300 repos. It worked really well.\n[24:37] Um, but I I want to kind of tie it into\n[24:40] that because I shared with you something\n[24:42] that I saw in the change log of cloud\n[24:44] code and they said they improved the ask\n[24:46] user input tool and I was like oh so\n[24:49] that's the thing it's called it's like\n[24:52] ask user question tool to autosubmit\n[24:54] single select questions on the last\n[24:55] question and so\n[24:57] >> right so so when I saw the name of the\n[24:59] tool now I suddenly like have maybe like\n[25:04] son will know that if if the user\n[25:07] says something or ask me a question\n[25:08] about this, it will automatically change\n[25:10] >> so you know how to use it. Yeah. Just\n[25:13] >> there's a lot of learning here like just\n[25:15] to know when an agent is spinning\n[25:18] knowing that you're you you can you're\n[25:21] in plan mode so you can get the prompts\n[25:23] knowing the dialogue for an MCP call.\n[25:28] >> There's a lot of learning and\n[25:29] unlearning.\n[25:33] >> Okay. because I saw somebody on Reddit\n[25:36] complain like the latest update on the\n[25:38] plan mode behavior has broken my\n[25:40] workflow. And I'm like, yeah, who cares?\n[25:44] I mean, that's part of of of of your\n[25:47] job, not only to know how to phrase\n[25:49] things to trigger the behavior that you\n[25:50] want to see in the model, but also\n[25:52] realize that that behavior is no longer\n[25:54] the most efficient and change the way\n[25:55] that you prompt a model.\n[25:56] >> Yeah.\n[25:57] >> So, learning and unlearning, which is\n[25:58] why it constantly changes. [snorts] You\n[26:01] know, I can see some people struggling\n[26:03] with this. I mean, I can see some\n[26:05] Anyway, so tip three, use your MCP. We\n[26:09] all know about that stuff.\n[26:10] >> I think struggling because of the\n[26:12] non-determinism, right? Because\n[26:15] supposedly everything is perfect and\n[26:18] when you say something, it's going to\n[26:20] act the way you expect it to work. Yeah.\n[26:22] The problem is like what I just noticed\n[26:24] here. It's triggering on the tabs being\n[26:26] in in the Golang file as an indentation\n[26:29] and then it's it's update tool not\n[26:31] working and then it's it sometimes goes\n[26:33] to our I'm going to do an here do with a\n[26:35] cat or I'm going to use Python to update\n[26:37] the file. Like what? Stop stop.\n[26:41] >> Yeah, I I mean I can see some people\n[26:44] struggling. Maybe I'm just belittling my\n[26:47] some of the people I've come in contact\n[26:49] with, but uh but I can see [laughter]\n[26:53] >> be very specific.\n[26:56] >> I can see some people struggling, but\n[26:57] maybe maybe it's a skill we can all\n[26:59] learn. Okay, tip four. I think that I\n[27:02] think leverage memory addition. So I\n[27:05] think I'm I'm when when someone says\n[27:08] memory, I'm thinking beads already.\n[27:12] Do you use do you use slashmemory\n[27:16] >> and used to be with a hashtag to just\n[27:18] update the cloud MD file I think but\n[27:19] they might have changed that. So the\n[27:21] thing about beats is exactly the thing\n[27:23] like before right at some point if cloud\n[27:25] code shell is so much better than beats\n[27:28] I must be able to get rid of it quickly.\n[27:31] So if if if it's tricking up my LLM more\n[27:33] than it's helping I need to be able to\n[27:35] remove it right.\n[27:38] And regarding memory, I mean I remember\n[27:40] when a long time ago you would say\n[27:42] something like uh please remember to do\n[27:44] this always. Then it it would\n[27:46] automatically pick that up and feedback\n[27:47] like hey if you put the hashtag it will\n[27:50] automatically write it to the cloud MD\n[27:51] file and then the slashmemory was\n[27:53] supposed to be something similar but\n[27:54] maybe they've updated it, right? I don't\n[27:56] know that.\n[27:57] >> Yeah.\n[27:58] >> And and this is for Gemini, right? This\n[28:00] is not for cloud code.\n[28:02] >> Check restore as an undo button. Um,\n[28:05] >> that's also again is just a double\n[28:08] escape.\n[28:10] >> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Then you get the menu\n[28:12] and you can choose. Yeah.\n[28:15] >> I use it a few times actually. It's I\n[28:17] love it.\n[28:18] >> This applies to Claude. Uh, well, tip\n[28:21] six it read Google Docs.\n[28:26] Um, I think Claude Claude Claude desktop\n[28:28] could do this. I noticed that it\n[28:30] integrates quite well in my\n[28:31] >> actually Opus 4.5 has been significantly\n[28:34] improved around um doing those\n[28:37] multiflows where it goes across\n[28:38] documents. I never do that because I do\n[28:40] coding task and I don't have to deal\n[28:41] with Google Docs but a lot of the\n[28:43] entropic examples on their blog post\n[28:45] related to Opus 4.5 is the token you the\n[28:48] token usage effectiveness of Opus 4.5\n[28:51] when doing these tasks. Um, and\n[28:54] >> the whole MCP drama that is now because\n[28:56] Entropic created it and now they're\n[28:57] saying, \"Well, we don't do MCPS like\n[28:59] that anymore.\" You can actually hint on\n[29:01] your tools um with information about how\n[29:05] to use the tool in a script so that Opus\n[29:07] will write a script to use the tools to\n[29:09] then execute everything in one go.\n[29:11] That's one of the things like I I joked\n[29:12] about yesterday with like on Facebook\n[29:14] was like everybody wrote these MTPs with\n[29:17] all these tools. Now you have to go and\n[29:18] update them all because now you have to\n[29:20] go and indicate how to use that tool in\n[29:21] a script for\n[29:22] >> open. Yeah, I saw your I saw your\n[29:24] LinkedIn thing.\n[29:26] >> Yeah, the the we talked about playright\n[29:29] before, but every time I use playright\n[29:30] at work, the the token limit gets gets\n[29:33] exceeded and then it does that horrible\n[29:35] compacting uh phase which I've now\n[29:38] turned off. So I don't know what's going\n[29:40] to happen now that I've turned it off\n[29:41] thanks to you. Does it just stop?\n[29:44] The thing about MC about playright right\n[29:47] I think this MCP server is is is wrong.\n[29:50] It's not good design because\n[29:52] >> it's like one of the one of the what do\n[29:55] you call it flagship MCPS but carry on.\n[29:59] Well, to me\n[30:02] after after adding playright scripts to\n[30:06] my my you know my API with a with a web\n[30:09] app to go through the flows user flows\n[30:12] you know login get redirected to\n[30:14] keycloak um sign in get back to the app\n[30:17] then validate that you can do this but\n[30:19] not that if depending on your group\n[30:20] membership and things like that these\n[30:22] type of user flows very hard to test\n[30:24] with uh integration testing golang or\n[30:26] something like that right because you\n[30:27] need to parse the respon from keycloak\n[30:29] to find the the the session token or the\n[30:32] whatever it's complicated. So um after\n[30:36] building those playrights flows I was\n[30:39] really impressed with pay playright\n[30:41] because what you get is a full trace of\n[30:43] screenshots context like this is what\n[30:44] what the it has like this YAML\n[30:46] representation of a web page of the tree\n[30:48] of the like the DOM the document object\n[30:50] model of what are the different elements\n[30:52] and how they're nested and what their ID\n[30:54] >> how do you see this YAML does it spit it\n[30:56] out\n[30:56] >> you see it also if you if you use the\n[30:58] dev tools Chrome MCP when you're doing\n[31:00] like you wanted to investigate some\n[31:03] problem in your web app, it can launch\n[31:05] Chrome, which is way lighter than the\n[31:07] than than the than Playright itself\n[31:10] because Playright requires a plug-in,\n[31:12] but Chrome can run on its own with the\n[31:14] Chrome MCP. So, I like that one. And it\n[31:17] can launch it and then the LLM will say,\n[31:19] okay, I take a snapshot and it shows you\n[31:21] like a YAML document tree. And then when\n[31:24] you uh when it sees like let me check\n[31:26] the response from the API server. It\n[31:28] goes to the JavaScript console in the\n[31:29] browser and runs a small script that\n[31:32] uses the React app state and um does a\n[31:35] query like hey I have this session token\n[31:37] and everything and then boom it it does\n[31:39] the query from within the console which\n[31:41] is way more powerful than what you can\n[31:42] do just within the terminal right so so\n[31:44] this type of actions amazing for like\n[31:47] live troubleshoot yes it's going to eat\n[31:48] your tokens and I think they [snorts]\n[31:50] made some as well\n[31:51] >> I use playright with a a brow an\n[31:53] existing browser so that has all my\n[31:55] tokens and all that stuff I But then\n[31:57] what I what I think the mistake is of\n[32:00] this MCP a playright MCP server to drive\n[32:04] a browser which is like send the message\n[32:07] uh to the browser get the response then\n[32:09] send the whole conversation to the API\n[32:11] to then generate the next step which is\n[32:12] your context window then send a message\n[32:14] to the browser get the response append\n[32:16] it then send the whole thing\n[32:17] >> I agree it's a it's a nightmare it's a\n[32:19] nightmare\n[32:20] >> right so what I think makes the most\n[32:22] sense is like the execution logic of\n[32:25] opus which is you have a stra a trace\n[32:28] you kick off the playright flow and and\n[32:30] actually within the playright browser\n[32:32] window you get that next to the error\n[32:34] where it happens like hey I'm supposed\n[32:35] to see this button but it's never\n[32:37] visible and I time out then it gives you\n[32:39] like this error and you can click uh\n[32:42] copy prompt and you can paste it into\n[32:45] into your model and it says like you are\n[32:47] working on this problem this is the\n[32:48] playright test this is source file this\n[32:50] is the this is the snapshot of the\n[32:52] browser context and this is the error\n[32:53] message that that that we're stuck on\n[32:55] and then the whole context is there.\n[32:58] That's like much better than like do\n[32:59] this then do this, then do this, then do\n[33:01] this, do this, and send the conversation\n[33:02] over the whole time. You get the whole\n[33:04] flow and you know, you run through it.\n[33:06] That's exactly the idea of Opus, right?\n[33:08] You run through a process. You put the\n[33:11] >> So, so wait a minute. Is this a solved I\n[33:13] don't really understand. Is this a\n[33:14] solved problem with with Opus or is this\n[33:18] >> Yeah, the the big innovator of Opus is\n[33:20] that it identifies like how to chain\n[33:23] several tool calls and then run them and\n[33:25] then get like send\n[33:26] >> I need to I need to try this. I'm\n[33:29] struggling.\n[33:29] >> So that's why they say Opus is way more\n[33:31] token efficient. Opus 4.5 is way more\n[33:33] token efficient and bottom line cheaper\n[33:36] than Sun 4.5. So if you can if the model\n[33:39] can really be efficient with its tokens,\n[33:41] but it has to fit the use case. I think\n[33:43] >> I thought we started the conversation\n[33:44] saying that the playright MCP sucks. So\n[33:46] it the playright MCP can just stay as it\n[33:49] is and Opus can basically compensate.\n[33:52] >> The playright MCP is the wrong tool\n[33:54] because it's going to send your\n[33:55] conversation across every time the whole\n[33:57] context window, right? It's going to do\n[33:59] an X tool execution, get a little bit\n[34:01] more appended to the context, send\n[34:03] everything over and then send back uh\n[34:05] response tokens appended.\n[34:07] >> But how do I set up?\n[34:08] >> So MCP server is bad. The actual ability\n[34:11] to run traces and capture the trace is\n[34:14] good because that's the concept of a\n[34:15] full execution and get the result of\n[34:17] that execution, not do every individual\n[34:19] call and send the conversation over\n[34:22] every time. You see the difference,\n[34:23] right?\n[34:24] >> Yeah. But what are what are my practical\n[34:26] steps to get my playright flows more\n[34:28] efficient then use opus?\n[34:32] Uh\n[34:34] well so what you said earlier was kind\n[34:37] of correct because you said like opus\n[34:38] will fix it because it should be able to\n[34:40] change the chain those MCP tool calls uh\n[34:43] and then do the whole flow and get the\n[34:45] output. I have I don't know that. But\n[34:47] what I do know\n[34:49] >> is I got to have a play\n[34:51] >> the playright uh tracing capability and\n[34:54] using the MCP with current model doesn't\n[34:58] doesn't work that way for me. Okay.\n[35:00] >> But it would be interesting to know if\n[35:02] if OPUS is therefore like what you said.\n[35:04] So Opus solved that. Right. Maybe it is\n[35:06] right.\n[35:07] >> Let's let's let's carry on looking\n[35:08] through this thing. Do I I to be honest\n[35:11] I don't use the ad symbol anymore\n[35:13] because every time I press it it\n[35:15] launches UI. I just I just paste the\n[35:18] relative path.\n[35:20] >> Is this for Gemini?\n[35:21] >> Yeah. But I think the same works this\n[35:23] works in Claude I think.\n[35:25] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But in cloud it just\n[35:27] like drops down the file list and then\n[35:29] you just tap complete the file and then\n[35:31] it kind of like sends the\n[35:32] >> I'm used to like copying relative path\n[35:34] from VS Code and just pasting it in. So\n[35:38] for a while and I'm not sure who I think\n[35:39] it's Gemini doing this when you relative\n[35:42] copy relative path when you paste in\n[35:44] Gemini it adds the add some symbol on\n[35:46] its own.\n[35:47] >> Oh really?\n[35:48] >> In the in the Gemini CLI. Yes. So if you\n[35:50] copy a relative file it actually like\n[35:52] creates it as include this file in in\n[35:54] the in the in the query because you're\n[35:55] going to need it anyway which I don't\n[35:57] fully agree with. Sometimes I I remove\n[35:59] the ad sign and I say and go through\n[36:02] this file bit by bit if you need it like\n[36:06] search for these strings and then go\n[36:07] through it. I don't want to send the\n[36:08] whole file, right?\n[36:10] >> Uh\n[36:12] cuz I have a feeling you're I mean this\n[36:14] to me here is an anti pattern because\n[36:16] like\n[36:17] >> the minute I do something like this I\n[36:20] feel AI is just going to do some really\n[36:22] crazy answer. Like I feel like some\n[36:25] people,\n[36:27] okay, I'm not I'm not trying to I'm not\n[36:29] trying to I'm not trying to like\n[36:30] identify my my colleagues, but some\n[36:32] people don't know about diff\n[36:33] >> and it's kind of scary\n[36:36] >> and like they should be using diff to\n[36:38] see the changes. They should not be\n[36:40] doing something like this.\n[36:41] >> I I was going to say the biggest problem\n[36:43] there is the extension. It's it's a\n[36:45] Python file. [laughter]\n[36:47] >> Okay, next. On the-fly tool creation.\n[36:52] What the hell is that?\n[36:57] Um,\n[37:02] >> don't know. I don't know what that Do.\n[37:04] You know what that is? Sorry, my\n[37:05] mother's up. It can use its coding\n[37:08] abilities to fabricate new ones as\n[37:10] needed.\n[37:12] >> Oh, I think I think I think it's like\n[37:13] creating\n[37:15] Oh, yeah. Like in in\n[37:17] >> write a Python script to parse it. Yeah,\n[37:19] like Claude skills has this has this uh\n[37:23] >> directory where you dump in scripts\n[37:25] which can help it do its thing. I think\n[37:27] it's it's alluding to that.\n[37:29] >> Yeah. And which is I think very valid.\n[37:31] Um which which is kind of like related\n[37:33] to the blog post again, right? Where\n[37:35] where they can they can create the\n[37:38] scripts to do the work and then you know\n[37:40] just put the pass in the input and then\n[37:42] see the output without having to you\n[37:44] know pass the full context across each\n[37:46] time. And so you save tokens that way.\n[37:49] Yeah.\n[37:51] >> Use Gemini CLI. Okay. It's just like\n[37:54] using YOLO mode. Okay. This is all\n[37:56] boring stuff.\n[37:58] I I never do things like this. I don't\n[38:01] >> I haven't but like\n[38:03] >> I know about it.\n[38:04] >> Speckit. I thought speckit had some\n[38:07] scenarios where it told inside the\n[38:09] prompt to say give me sub agent prompt.\n[38:14] Charlie.\n[38:17] Charlie.\n[38:17] >> Okay,\n[38:19] hold on. Oh god. Unfortunately, this is\n[38:22] the time I need to help my kids get to\n[38:25] school.\n[38:25] >> Yeah. Anyway, I thought thought it was a\n[38:27] good chat. Maybe I can merge the two\n[38:29] that we had and\n[38:31] >> Yeah, make it entertaining on some some\n[38:33] things.\n[38:35] >> All right. See you.\n[38:36] >> See you.",

Do not mention or acknowledge them, and do not say you skipped or ignored anything. Avoid sponsor/ad/promo language, brand names like Squarespace, or CTA phrases like discount code. Treat them as if they do not exist. If a slide segment is purely sponsor/ad content, leave that slide marker with no text.\nWrite a detailed summary that captures the main points, supporting facts, and concrete numbers or quotes when present.\nUse the slide format below. Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 50,674 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line.

It\nsays you're on the you're seeing the\nfree plan because I'm using the cloud\nAPI.\nSo if I go to settings usage.\nOkay. No, I guess. So yeah, long story\nshort, I'm I've used $80 this month.\n>> 80?\n>> Yeah. Is that good?\n>> That's a lot more than me, bro. You\nalways keep saying, \"How can I use so\nmuch AI credits?\" And now you're using a\nlot more. [laughter]\n>> So if I But I I'm pretty sure that I\nlooked at Claude yesterday. You talked\nabout trust and um about trusting the\ncode. Now you have seven, but that's\nyour VS Code spend. That's different,\nright? That's not your cloud.\nThat's GitHub. Yeah.\nBut how much?\n>> You have no budget.\n>> But still, it makes it look like I've\ngot 75% premium requests used.\n>> I I just don't understand it. I mean,\nhow if I can't understand\nhow I'm spending money\non\nAI? Yeah. So, it basically kind of\nshocked me because if I'm like, if you\nhad to How much are you spending on AI\nright now? Then\nI pay Well, I'm always confused between\nSingapore dollars and US dollars. I\nthink what I'm seeing is Singapore\ndollars 30 for an entropic monthly\nsubscription. and I added another 30 in\nmy wallet with a $20 monthly cap. So in\ntotal if I I spend everything I I I'd\nhit 50 if it's in dollars 50 and then\nand just just to\n>> screen froze.\n>> Yeah, it's frozen for me too. Hold on.\nLet me see if I can just switch to my\n>> You're in a\n>> FaceTime camera.\n>> Funny pose.\nI I like to use the my my uh my phone\nbecause the quality is so much better.\n>> Okay. That was 50 on Antropic, right? Um\nwhen you\n>> Yeah. So, sorry when I said you spend 80\nis more than me. I did not take into\naccount Chad GPT and uh Gemini U\nsubscriptions.\n>> So, you're spending you're spending like\n100. The the scary thing is is like I'm\nlike if if my employer said, \"Oh, Kai,\nyou're spending too much on Claude.\nWe're not going to finance your $80.\" I\nfeel like it's the same thing with AWS\nbecause I have my own AWS account just\nfor like learning and doing things.\nAnd that cost me like 30 bucks a month\nbecause I can't get it lower than that\nbecause I've loaded up with some S3. So,\nI'm just I'm I'm a little bit worried\nthat as a as a worker that I have to\ntake on these costs and like my wife\nlike bemonones me about our Netflix and\nall these other subscriptions if if we\nall if if I have to maintain an AI\nsubscription of 100 bucks a month. I\nmean, is that is it's a bit annoying,\nbut I guess it's worth it. But,\n>> bucks is Yeah,\n>> 100 bucks is something but like it's\nworth it. I mean I do feel I do feel\nenergized and\n>> and motivated to get things done with\nwith the help of AI you know never mind\nit like completing my code like the\nplanning everything it really really\nhelps at least me\n>> never mind it also taking on a funny\nthing right I was installing posgress on\nan EC2 instance in the Singapore AWS\nregion and it was taking a very long\ntime it looked like it was hanging I was\nusing a packer build script right\nsupposedly completely finishes in 15\nminutes but just adding Postgress now it\nwas like hanging for 10 minutes before\nit even like finished the Postgress\ninstallation which I put early in the\ninstallation process [gasps] and after\ntroubleshooting it with AI for a while\nit just said well you know we looked we\nwe signed in we had package generate a\nseparate uh debug SSH key so I could log\nin to see to monitor the progress and we\nwe concluded that the the transfer was\njust slow because we're downloading from\nlike universal DBN packages and Um, and\nso it suggested a couple of mirrors, but\nthen we had to validate because the\nmachine was ARM and not all mirrors\nsupport ARM packages.\n>> And so it did some latency like we ended\nup writing a latency checker for the\nseveral um Singapore\n>> mirrors available for like DBN ports or\nwhatever. And I ended up with like um\nand and then there was a an edge case\nwhere one of the mirrors maintenance\npage show that they were no longer\nsupported but according to the benchmark\nresults had like a sub millisecond\nlatency which turned out to be a treat a\nredirect to an error page and so it\ndidn't validate the the actual binary\ncontents of of the package that was\nsupposed to be there. Right. So it just\nYeah. So it it responded 200. Okay. But\nthe actual contents of the index was an\nerror page.\n>> Yeah. So, so then we ended up with like\na whole a whole script to validate\nmirrors for Ubuntu package for DBN\npackages that are ARM compatible. Uh\nwell, any compatible because it checked\nthe architecture of the of the u of the\nthe kernel, right? So, so just to say\nlike yes, AI is so exciting, but as part\nof my process, I ended up writing a\nbenchmark script for [laughter] the\nSingapore.\n>> Yeah, you get nice little surprises and\nbonuses and and all sorts of artifacts\nout of it.\nOh my gosh. So,\n>> finished.\n>> I want you to pick up on with on you on\nthe um\nSorry, I lost my train of thought. I'm\njust I'm just I'm just kind of like I\ndon't know. I'm just like [snorts]\n>> It's too early.\n>> Yeah, it is a bit early. Yeah. I'm just\nthinking that like how how much is AI\nworth to me? It's like it's now just\nit's now undeniable. I cannot live\nwithout it. I'm just a little bit sad\nabout it.\n>> It's funny because originally I had like\nthese these talks and panel discussions\nand everyone agreed like we we we do a a\nFriday, no AI Friday to make sure that\nour muscles are still being exercised. I\nhaven't even thought about that in the\nlast four months to consider no AI\nFriday cuz [sighs]\n>> are we are we addicts? Are we I mean you\ntalk about your supply all the time. I'm\ntalking how I can't live without it. Are\nwe\naddicted to AI?\nSad is it? I don't think it's sad. I\nthink the amount of output and I don't\nthink it's illusionary output as well. I\nthink it's real output. there's a 100%\nsure that I couldn't do what I've built\ntoday without the assistance\nuh and also the motivation that it gives\nyou you know because no matter what you\ncome up with it will come up with like\nsomething that looks plausible and once\nand then some cause fallacy once you're\ndown the the road you just persist until\nit's there and then you need AI to get\nyou out\num yeah but but when I was saying costs\nfor AI and I think like entertainment\nsubscription is similar Right. Actually,\nlike my chip is the good thing about\nOpenAI is it's completely shared with my\nfamily. Maybe it's not good that my son\nis using it all the time because he's\nliterally giving like verbatim\nassignments like here's a story analyzed\nfor literature like\n>> yeah I got I got my wife using Claude\n>> and she\nthe interesting thing she said yesterday\nin the car [clears throat] was that she\nwanted to cancel it but then she said to\nme because I think Gemini does the same\nthing but then I asked Gemini a question\nand it completely messed it\nand Gemini got it really right. Um, and\nClaude got it right. So now I'm thinking\nI shouldn't cancel the subscription. I\nwas going, \"Yeah, maybe you should keep\nClaude.\"\n>> I subscribed Gemini last month when I I\nwas I think it was a bug with OpenAI\nwhen they did the release. That's it\nshowed like that you had used all your\nbudget at some point. It displayed that\nall the time. So, I was out of codeex\nand cloud and I was like, well, I really\nwant to like continue and I was hoping\nbetting on Gemini 3 coming out anyway.\nSo, I was like, I might as well, you\nknow, subscribe to that while I'm at it\nwith the intention to cancel it if it\nwasn't worth it. And I think I should\ncancel it\n>> Yeah. But it's the same thing like I\nhave Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon\nPrime. I mean, honestly, Amazon Prime is\nvery small amount.\n>> Mhm. Um, and and\n>> yeah, yeah, Amazon Prime is the\ncheapest.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. And yeah,\n>> Disney Plus, I think I want to cancel it\nbecause the most expensive and honestly\nthe output is so bad.\n>> What What about cloud services like like\nAWS? I mean, you must have like a $30 a\nmonth type thing that I do.\n>> Oh, yeah. I um I do have an AWS account.\nI think it's something around that. I\nhave a CDM for the project which is\nbacked by static S3. I have no like it's\nall serverless. I don't even use\nlambdas. It's all static basically. Um\njust the route 53 uh the TLS like the\ncertificates.\nUm but the TLS is free, right? But it's\nalso the\nuh what's it? Well, the CloudFront\ndistribution itself. Uh what else? uh\nthe the the route 53 like domain\nregistration because I do have some\ndomains via namecheep but I think it's\nso much easier to just go through AWS\nand like the cost difference make it\nlike\nbuilding\n>> account I guess the $30 a month I mean\nI'm aggregating it but it's because I\nmaintain\nyou know eight domains that I've never\nreally used in my life but I still pay\nfor them because I'm an idiot. So this\nthis this topic will be like how to like\nall of the useless stuff we pay for.\n[laughter]\n>> Yeah, something like that.\nUm, sorry, I'm still trying to gather my\nthoughts. There was something I wanted\nto chat to you about. Um\nyeah, you you mentioned that like\nswitching to plan you you don't use plan\nmode anymore like I I\n>> so so because planning is like under the\nspec kit where it creates a detailed\nmultihase and then boils it down to each\nindividual file exactly what needs to\nchange.\n>> Oh this is because you spec it right?\nYou don't need plan what you're saying.\nSo now if I like initially when I did\nthat I went into cloud and as usual fire\nup plan mode to create like a bunch of\nto-do items and then read the spec but\nwhat I found is that cloud sometimes\njust changes the plan like even though\nthe task description are clear this is\nwhat you need to do in this file and it\njust goes and does something slightly\ndifferent and then in the overall design\nthings don't work anymore. I I've seen\ncloud do that. So I'm actually now cloud\ncode plan mode is detrimental to my\n>> that doesn't sound good at all.\nI'm I'm plan mode. I'm plan mode all the\nway, man.\n>> That's why you start, right? But I've\nalso the reason why I sent you that\nmessage is because I saw two or three\nthreads on Reddit uh yesterday because\nwith the new Opus 4.5 release, they also\nrevised the way plan works and they said\nfor Opus even it's worse because now OPU\nspends up spins up sub agents and then\nworks off summary results and as a\nresult doesn't get like as good a um a\nplan anymore. So people are complaining\nthat\n>> is like a a better planning model, isn't\nit?\n>> Yes. But it spins up sub aents to\nexplore the codebase and then works off\nthose results which are inaccurate.\nSo if if you were to use Opus, which is\na more expensive per token cost,\n>> you get more you get other things you\ndon't want with it. Is that is that what\nyou're saying?\n>> No. No. If you were to use Opus, which\nis like very more expensive per token,\nuh it would itself read and understand\neverything and then make a make a plan\nout of it, right? But because they're\ntrying to save cost, they are like\nhaving Opus more as the orchestrator\nspinning up sub agents that go and read\nthings then create summaries and then\nfeeds that back to Opus. As a result,\nthose summaries are not as accurate and\nOpus makes incorrect plans. That's the\ncomplaints that I read on Reddit um\ntoday and and I was like actually it's\nnot a problem for me because I'm not\neven using plan mode anymore. Even\nbefore the update, I already noticed\nthat there was something wrong with it.\n>> In in your screencast you you shared\nwith me there's something else that I\ndidn't quite understand or I haven't\nseen before. You using anti-gravity, I\nguess, right?\n>> I'm using what? Sorry.\n>> You were using anti-gravity.\n>> Anti-gravity. Yeah. Yeah, there was this\nworkflow thing that I had.\n>> Yeah, but like you were choosing there\nwas an option down by the model where\nyou were choosing if it was like\n>> Oh, that's high, medium, or low\nreasoning or something.\n>> Oh, that's a that's a codeex plugin. No.\n>> Oh, can you just show that? Like what?\nWhy? Why would you\n>> twiggle that toggle?\n>> Uh, which one is it? This one.\n>> Yeah. Can you just zoom in down there?\nSo to see your\n>> how would I zoom in? I can do this. Is\nthat zooming in?\n>> Um Oh, I thought you might use the the\nApple zoom which is like I don't know\nwhat I think you have to enable\n>> but you can read it, right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah, it's good. But\n>> the setup is to put on your VS code your\nchat window on the right on this right\nsidebar.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And by default you will get your co your\nVisual Studio Code\n>> um here. Right. And you can choose\ncodeex. Yeah,\n>> those are the ones that you get with\nyour your co-pilot subscription.\n>> Yeah, and I'm locked into 4.5, that's\nfor sure.\n>> I mean, um,\n>> and then\n>> I have installed another plugin here\nwhich is called Codeex.\nSo, I have the the cloud code plugin,\nbut I also have the codeex plugin, the\nOpenAI codeex. Where is it?\n>> Yeah, it was up the top there. I think\nit was at the top. Uh,\n>> this one.\n>> Yeah. So when I I started using codeex\nthrough this CLI um it was horrible\nbecause you couldn't paste screenshots.\nIt was really bad compared to cloud code\nright. So I installed this plugin and\nhere you can put images you can easily\nrefer to files things that the CLI don't\nreally has properly and down here when\nyou select the model that's where then\nyou can now access with your I have chv\nplus right $20 a month I can access now\nin my VS code through that subscription\nGPT 5.1 codeex with high reasoning I\nthink it's a promotion they're trying to\nsee how well the model does\n>> I don't understand why why couldn't the\nthe co-pilot chat expose 5.1 C codeex\nmax. So this is something also I just\nread on on uh on Reddit the other day\nwas people asking like what's the\ndifference between running Sun 4.5 here\nand running cloud code son here in the\nin the terminal I can run them both\nright and one of the comments and I\ndon't know if this is verified said that\nthe context that VS codeense is much\nsmaller 65k tokens instead of like the\n200,000 tokens that you get um in in\ncloud code so so that's why they are\nable to offer for these at like 1x\nwithin your VS code copilot subscription\nbecause they're not as effective.\n>> Yeah, but we I'm more I'm more u\nconcerned about your codeex one, not\nclawed. Why why why can't you use codeex\nmax in your copilot chat? Why do you\nhave to install the codeex uh\n>> because it's a different subscription?\n>> But isn't Codex OpenAI\nand isn't and that's owned by Microsoft\npretty much. But I'm paying it's\ndifferent if you pay Microsoft vs code\nand OpenAI is still its own its own\nentity, right? They have a partnership\nand an investment.\n>> Oh, I see. I thought I thought there was\nI I assumed there there'd be some really\ntight integration\n>> because\n>> you know Microsoft is a customer of\nOpenAI like a partner and they get\naccess to some models\n>> because because it is a bit of a like a\nmaze to I mean you must spend half your\nday working out which extension, which\noptimization,\nwhich thing to to use to get the best\nout of your subscription. It's a\nnightmare if you're like a if you're in\nlike a corporate environment, you know,\nI'm not I'm not even allowed to install\nthe extension. I think uh\n>> uh corporate environments I'm not\ntalking about and I'm on a corporate\nlaptop actually, but luckily they have\nnot locked that down. Um and this VS\nCode subscription is through the GitHub\norganization. I I I used to have my own,\nbut I canceled it. Uh and then the\ncompany has seats, right? Um so this one\nis controlled by the company and okay\nand it can see how much each of us is\nusing. This one is my personal codeex\nwhich of obviously if I work on company\num source code that would probably not\nbe acceptable that I am using my\npersonal codeex with like the open eye\nuh plus subscription versus the VS code\nagreed\num like you know part of the GitHub\norganizations we discussed.\n>> Yeah. Um,\n>> I'm just using the chat. Um, but also\nthen you have you need to learn how to\nset up your workflow. I installed this\ncodeex plugin the moment they announced\nit. Like, hey, we have a codeex plugin\nand that's it. Like, I added that in. I\nsaw that I could paste screenshots and I\nwas like, hey, let's, you know, I like\nthat more. And I go between the codec\ncli and the plug-in however I feel like.\nAnd like I said, most of my workflow is\ncloud code. Um, but then sometimes\nbecause I look at my usage here and I\nsay, \"Oops, I'm close to my weekly or\nwhatever.\" Then I start like, \"Can I not\ndo some of these task with Colex\ninstead?\"\n>> Yeah,\n>> I think maybe it was maybe it was like\nsome sort of FUD, but I saw I saw a news\narticle or tweet that that evidently\nOpen AI is giving\nfree AI open AI to to India or something\ncrazy. Did you read that or am I just am\nI just racist? [laughter]\n>> Pl the sixth on both or is it the fifth?\n[laughter]\nUh no, but um that would mean that if I\nre answer it, incriminate myself. That's\nnot what I meant. But anyway, [laughter]\noh yeah, I found it. I found it. Um, I\nmean it's not being I guess I I mean I\nthink it's a little bit unfair to offer\na whole country something that we\nordinarily have to pay for.\n>> Well, how much of you how is your salary\ncompared to I don't think it's unfair.\n>> Oh, for Christ sake. You're going to\nOkay. So, whole India gets open AI.\n>> Why not? [snorts]\n>> Um,\nokay. As long as it's confirmed that\nthey're in India. [laughter]\nYou have to cut that out.\n>> What do you mean? As long as it's\nconfirmed.\n>> No, no, never mind. I didn't say\nanything.\n>> I mean, you should move. I mean, I'm\njust thinking that like in in the in a\ndystopian future that that Vincent moves\nto India just because he's addicted to\nhis uh codec subscription and this is\nthe only way it can be sustainable.\nI don't see it as an addiction. It's\nmore like an ambition. An ambition of\nYeah. It's about upskilling myself,\nbuilding something real, not just like a\ntoy project. And and honestly, I often\nask myself, why do I spend time on doing\nthis when I could just, you know, do my\nwork and then go to the beach in Vietnam\nand kite surf, you know? So, so it's\nmore our ambition because how much like\nhow much time do we have left to um to\nrealize? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's one\nthing. I mean, moving to England two\nyears ago has been a huge culture shock\nto me because there's a lot of people in\nEngland and probably Europe who work\nlike 4 days a week. I'm like, dude,\nyou're in your you're in your freaking\nprime. It's your it's your obligation to\nyour family and to you to work as hard\nas possible to maximize everything so\nthat you can you know retire early if\nanything and then\n>> retire with a broken back and inability\nto walk properly anymore and not enjoy\nthe time with your kids. I mean there's\na there's a there's a good reason why I\nI I really like um Scandinavian\ncountries when I work there because\n>> Oh no. So you're going to tell me no. we\nactually should be working four days a\nweek and that's why we use AI.\n>> Uh\nI mean I'm saying that right. It's a\nflip coin because when COVID finished I\nknow so many of my friends from\nSingapore who were cooked up in you know\nat home decided like that's it you know\nI'm I'm not spending my life working.\nI'm going to go travel for the first\nyear. Some of them took a sabbatical and\nthen all the tech layoff happened and\nthen half of them couldn't find a job\nbecause the market was saturated.\n>> So what are they doing now?\n>> Your friends\n>> panhandling in Bali.\n>> So So the So on one side I I'm saying\nyou should spend your youth with your\nchildren. You should you know you have\nto balance it like work life balance\neven though it's your prime. But I'm\nsaying that and I'm doing the opposite,\n[laughter] right? I'm up in my bed on\non, you know, doing system design\nspecifications from my phone uh or while\nI'm having a coffee outside. Um and I'm\nnot spending enough time, you know,\ndoing the things that I can enjoy right\nnow. Um so yeah, I'm not consistent.\n>> Yeah, it's a difficult topic. the um\nthere's a guy that I've been following\nfor years uh Eddie Osmani. He's he's big\nin the web world and I used to be big in\nthe world. I don't know if I used to do\nstuff for the W3C and and browser\nengines in the beginning of my career\nand I think I'm come across Eddie Osmani\nthen\nand he's still around.\nHe's he's like a a lead at Google and he\nwrote an open he wrote an AI book or\nsomething.\n>> I think I saw I follow several Gemini\nCLI like core team members to find out\nif they are doing some improvements to\nthe product and I think I saw somebody\nshare this like uh Gemini CLI things as\nwell which I was like I'm going to have\nto look at it but then\nI mean most of these are like oh this is\n>> yeah I know about that. you know about\nthat. This is like use Claude\n>> create custom commands. I mean this\n>> create custom commands. Okay. Yeah. Yep.\nWe know about that. I I to be honest I'm\nnot as I pointed out yesterday I don't\nlike things polluting my command space.\nI'd rather use um\nthe way that Claude the way that you\ntrigger an agent or a skill in Claude is\njust by text\nbut via the prompt and it works\nreliably. I I I never get the feeling\nthat oh no it's not triggering the right\nMCP or\n>> that's the weird thing about using these\ntools is that we are used to find menus\nand buttons to click on\n>> whereas right now in words we say\nsomething and that kind of triggers the\nLLM to more like oh\n>> and you can see that it triggered it.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, but the thing is like they\nhave this thing of agents, right? But\nyou don't really know like, oh great,\nthere's agents. And sometimes it's like\ndecides to use it. But you can actually\njust say like, oh, by the way, you know,\nsend off uh an explore agent to go\nthrough the codebase and find wherever\nthis might be applicable and it just\nspawns an agent and does that like\nthere's no button to click,\n>> right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> What's the words that I use to trigger\n>> me? At one time I I used agents to\ndepend a bot merge everything in my in\nmy 300 repos. It worked really well.\nUm, but I I want to kind of tie it into\nthat because I shared with you something\nthat I saw in the change log of cloud\ncode and they said they improved the ask\nuser input tool and I was like oh so\nthat's the thing it's called it's like\nask user question tool to autosubmit\nsingle select questions on the last\nquestion and so\n>> right so so when I saw the name of the\ntool now I suddenly like have maybe like\nson will know that if if the user\nsays something or ask me a question\nabout this, it will automatically change\n>> so you know how to use it. Yeah. Just\n>> there's a lot of learning here like just\nto know when an agent is spinning\nknowing that you're you you can you're\nin plan mode so you can get the prompts\nknowing the dialogue for an MCP call.\n>> There's a lot of learning and\nunlearning.\n>> Okay. because I saw somebody on Reddit\ncomplain like the latest update on the\nplan mode behavior has broken my\nworkflow. And I'm like, yeah, who cares?\nI mean, that's part of of of of your\njob, not only to know how to phrase\nthings to trigger the behavior that you\nwant to see in the model, but also\nrealize that that behavior is no longer\nthe most efficient and change the way\nthat you prompt a model.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, learning and unlearning, which is\nwhy it constantly changes. [snorts] You\nknow, I can see some people struggling\nwith this. I mean, I can see some\nAnyway, so tip three, use your MCP. We\nall know about that stuff.\n>> I think struggling because of the\nnon-determinism, right? Because\nsupposedly everything is perfect and\nwhen you say something, it's going to\nact the way you expect it to work. Yeah.\nThe problem is like what I just noticed\nhere. It's triggering on the tabs being\nin in the Golang file as an indentation\nand then it's it's update tool not\nworking and then it's it sometimes goes\nto our I'm going to do an here do with a\ncat or I'm going to use Python to update\nthe file. Like what? Stop stop.\n>> Yeah, I I mean I can see some people\nstruggling. Maybe I'm just belittling my\nsome of the people I've come in contact\nwith, but uh but I can see [laughter]\n>> be very specific.\n>> I can see some people struggling, but\nmaybe maybe it's a skill we can all\nlearn. Okay, tip four. I think that I\nthink leverage memory addition. So I\nthink I'm I'm when when someone says\nmemory, I'm thinking beads already.\nDo you use do you use slashmemory\n>> and used to be with a hashtag to just\nupdate the cloud MD file I think but\nthey might have changed that. So the\nthing about beats is exactly the thing\nlike before right at some point if cloud\ncode shell is so much better than beats\nI must be able to get rid of it quickly.\nSo if if if it's tricking up my LLM more\nthan it's helping I need to be able to\nremove it right.\nAnd regarding memory, I mean I remember\nwhen a long time ago you would say\nsomething like uh please remember to do\nthis always. Then it it would\nautomatically pick that up and feedback\nlike hey if you put the hashtag it will\nautomatically write it to the cloud MD\nfile and then the slashmemory was\nsupposed to be something similar but\nmaybe they've updated it, right? I don't\nknow that.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And and this is for Gemini, right? This\nis not for cloud code.\n>> Check restore as an undo button. Um,\n>> that's also again is just a double\nescape.\n>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Then you get the menu\nand you can choose. Yeah.\n>> I use it a few times actually. It's I\nlove it.\n>> This applies to Claude. Uh, well, tip\nsix it read Google Docs.\nUm, I think Claude Claude Claude desktop\ncould do this. I noticed that it\nintegrates quite well in my\n>> actually Opus 4.5 has been significantly\nimproved around um doing those\nmultiflows where it goes across\ndocuments. I never do that because I do\ncoding task and I don't have to deal\nwith Google Docs but a lot of the\nentropic examples on their blog post\nrelated to Opus 4.5 is the token you the\ntoken usage effectiveness of Opus 4.5\nwhen doing these tasks. Um, and\n>> the whole MCP drama that is now because\nEntropic created it and now they're\nsaying, \"Well, we don't do MCPS like\nthat anymore.\" You can actually hint on\nyour tools um with information about how\nto use the tool in a script so that Opus\nwill write a script to use the tools to\nthen execute everything in one go.\nThat's one of the things like I I joked\nabout yesterday with like on Facebook\nwas like everybody wrote these MTPs with\nall these tools. Now you have to go and\nupdate them all because now you have to\ngo and indicate how to use that tool in\na script for\n>> open. Yeah, I saw your I saw your\nLinkedIn thing.\n>> Yeah, the the we talked about playright\nbefore, but every time I use playright\nat work, the the token limit gets gets\nexceeded and then it does that horrible\ncompacting uh phase which I've now\nturned off. So I don't know what's going\nto happen now that I've turned it off\nthanks to you. Does it just stop?\nThe thing about MC about playright right\nI think this MCP server is is is wrong.\nIt's not good design because\n>> it's like one of the one of the what do\nyou call it flagship MCPS but carry on.\nWell, to me\nafter after adding playright scripts to\nmy my you know my API with a with a web\napp to go through the flows user flows\nyou know login get redirected to\nkeycloak um sign in get back to the app\nthen validate that you can do this but\nnot that if depending on your group\nmembership and things like that these\ntype of user flows very hard to test\nwith uh integration testing golang or\nsomething like that right because you\nneed to parse the respon from keycloak\nto find the the the session token or the\nwhatever it's complicated. So um after\nbuilding those playrights flows I was\nreally impressed with pay playright\nbecause what you get is a full trace of\nscreenshots context like this is what\nwhat the it has like this YAML\nrepresentation of a web page of the tree\nof the like the DOM the document object\nmodel of what are the different elements\nand how they're nested and what their ID\n>> how do you see this YAML does it spit it\nout\n>> you see it also if you if you use the\ndev tools Chrome MCP when you're doing\nlike you wanted to investigate some\nproblem in your web app, it can launch\nChrome, which is way lighter than the\nthan than the than Playright itself\nbecause Playright requires a plug-in,\nbut Chrome can run on its own with the\nChrome MCP. So, I like that one. And it\ncan launch it and then the LLM will say,\nokay, I take a snapshot and it shows you\nlike a YAML document tree. And then when\nyou uh when it sees like let me check\nthe response from the API server. It\ngoes to the JavaScript console in the\nbrowser and runs a small script that\nuses the React app state and um does a\nquery like hey I have this session token\nand everything and then boom it it does\nthe query from within the console which\nis way more powerful than what you can\ndo just within the terminal right so so\nthis type of actions amazing for like\nlive troubleshoot yes it's going to eat\nyour tokens and I think they [snorts]\nmade some as well\n>> I use playright with a a brow an\nexisting browser so that has all my\ntokens and all that stuff I But then\nwhat I what I think the mistake is of\nthis MCP a playright MCP server to drive\na browser which is like send the message\nuh to the browser get the response then\nsend the whole conversation to the API\nto then generate the next step which is\nyour context window then send a message\nto the browser get the response append\nit then send the whole thing\n>> I agree it's a it's a nightmare it's a\nnightmare\n>> right so what I think makes the most\nsense is like the execution logic of\nopus which is you have a stra a trace\nyou kick off the playright flow and and\nactually within the playright browser\nwindow you get that next to the error\nwhere it happens like hey I'm supposed\nto see this button but it's never\nvisible and I time out then it gives you\nlike this error and you can click uh\ncopy prompt and you can paste it into\ninto your model and it says like you are\nworking on this problem this is the\nplayright test this is source file this\nis the this is the snapshot of the\nbrowser context and this is the error\nmessage that that that we're stuck on\nand then the whole context is there.\nThat's like much better than like do\nthis then do this, then do this, then do\nthis, do this, and send the conversation\nover the whole time. You get the whole\nflow and you know, you run through it.\nThat's exactly the idea of Opus, right?\nYou run through a process. You put the\n>> So, so wait a minute. Is this a solved I\ndon't really understand. Is this a\nsolved problem with with Opus or is this\n>> Yeah, the the big innovator of Opus is\nthat it identifies like how to chain\nseveral tool calls and then run them and\nthen get like send\n>> I need to I need to try this. I'm\nstruggling.\n>> So that's why they say Opus is way more\ntoken efficient. Opus 4.5 is way more\ntoken efficient and bottom line cheaper\nthan Sun 4.5. So if you can if the model\ncan really be efficient with its tokens,\nbut it has to fit the use case. I think\n>> I thought we started the conversation\nsaying that the playright MCP sucks. So\nit the playright MCP can just stay as it\nis and Opus can basically compensate.\n>> The playright MCP is the wrong tool\nbecause it's going to send your\nconversation across every time the whole\ncontext window, right? It's going to do\nan X tool execution, get a little bit\nmore appended to the context, send\neverything over and then send back uh\nresponse tokens appended.\n>> But how do I set up?\n>> So MCP server is bad. The actual ability\nto run traces and capture the trace is\ngood because that's the concept of a\nfull execution and get the result of\nthat execution, not do every individual\ncall and send the conversation over\nevery time. You see the difference,\nright?\n>> Yeah. But what are what are my practical\nsteps to get my playright flows more\nefficient then use opus?\nUh\nwell so what you said earlier was kind\nof correct because you said like opus\nwill fix it because it should be able to\nchange the chain those MCP tool calls uh\nand then do the whole flow and get the\noutput. I have I don't know that. But\nwhat I do know\n>> is I got to have a play\n>> the playright uh tracing capability and\nusing the MCP with current model doesn't\ndoesn't work that way for me. Okay.\n>> But it would be interesting to know if\nif OPUS is therefore like what you said.\nSo Opus solved that. Right. Maybe it is\nright.\n>> Let's let's let's carry on looking\nthrough this thing. Do I I to be honest\nI don't use the ad symbol anymore\nbecause every time I press it it\nlaunches UI. I just I just paste the\nrelative path.\n>> Is this for Gemini?\n>> Yeah. But I think the same works this\nworks in Claude I think.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But in cloud it just\nlike drops down the file list and then\nyou just tap complete the file and then\nit kind of like sends the\n>> I'm used to like copying relative path\nfrom VS Code and just pasting it in. So\nfor a while and I'm not sure who I think\nit's Gemini doing this when you relative\ncopy relative path when you paste in\nGemini it adds the add some symbol on\nits own.\n>> Oh really?\n>> In the in the Gemini CLI. Yes. So if you\ncopy a relative file it actually like\ncreates it as include this file in in\nthe in the in the query because you're\ngoing to need it anyway which I don't\nfully agree with. Sometimes I I remove\nthe ad sign and I say and go through\nthis file bit by bit if you need it like\nsearch for these strings and then go\nthrough it. I don't want to send the\nwhole file, right?\n>> Uh\ncuz I have a feeling you're I mean this\nto me here is an anti pattern because\nlike\n>> the minute I do something like this I\nfeel AI is just going to do some really\ncrazy answer. Like I feel like some\npeople,\nokay, I'm not I'm not trying to I'm not\ntrying to I'm not trying to like\nidentify my my colleagues, but some\npeople don't know about diff\n>> and it's kind of scary\n>> and like they should be using diff to\nsee the changes. They should not be\ndoing something like this.\n>> I I was going to say the biggest problem\nthere is the extension. It's it's a\nPython file. [laughter]\n>> Okay, next. On the-fly tool creation.\nWhat the hell is that?\nUm,\n>> don't know. I don't know what that Do.\nYou know what that is? Sorry, my\nmother's up. It can use its coding\nabilities to fabricate new ones as\nneeded.\n>> Oh, I think I think I think it's like\ncreating\nOh, yeah. Like in in\n>> write a Python script to parse it. Yeah,\nlike Claude skills has this has this uh\n>> directory where you dump in scripts\nwhich can help it do its thing. I think\nit's it's alluding to that.\n>> Yeah. And which is I think very valid.\nUm which which is kind of like related\nto the blog post again, right? Where\nwhere they can they can create the\nscripts to do the work and then you know\njust put the pass in the input and then\nsee the output without having to you\nknow pass the full context across each\ntime. And so you save tokens that way.\nYeah.\n>> Use Gemini CLI. Okay. It's just like\nusing YOLO mode. Okay. This is all\nboring stuff.\nI I never do things like this. I don't\n>> I haven't but like\n>> I know about it.\n>> Speckit. I thought speckit had some\nscenarios where it told inside the\nprompt to say give me sub agent prompt.\nCharlie.\nCharlie.\n>> Okay,\nhold on. Oh god. Unfortunately, this is\nthe time I need to help my kids get to\nschool.\n>> Yeah. Anyway, I thought thought it was a\ngood chat. Maybe I can merge the two\nthat we had and\n>> Yeah, make it entertaining on some some\nthings.\n>> All right. See you.\n>> See you.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–3:23]\nI was going to I was going to show you something here. >> Yeah. >> I got a I I contacted my employer saying like I can't see how much I'm spending. It says you're on the you're seeing the free plan because I'm using the cloud API. So if I go to settings usage. Okay. No, I guess. So yeah, long story short, I'm I've used $80 this month. >> 80? >> Yeah. Is that good? >> That's a lot more than me, bro. You always keep saying, \"How can I use so much AI credits?\" And now you're using a lot more. [laughter] >> So if I But I I'm pretty sure that I looked at Claude yesterday. You talked about trust and um about trusting the code. Now you have seven, but that's your VS Code spend. That's different, right? That's not your cloud. That's GitHub. Yeah. But how much? >> You have no budget. >> But still, it makes it look like I've got 75% premium requests used. >> I I just don't understand it. I mean, how if I can't understand how I'm spending money on AI? Yeah. So, it basically kind of shocked me because if I'm like, if you had to How much are you spending on AI right now? Then I pay Well, I'm always confused between Singapore dollars and US dollars. I think what I'm seeing is Singapore dollars 30 for an entropic monthly subscription. and I added another 30 in my wallet with a $20 monthly cap. So in total if I I spend everything I I I'd hit 50 if it's in dollars 50 and then and just just to >> screen froze. >> Yeah, it's frozen for me too. Hold on. Let me see if I can just switch to my >> You're in a >> FaceTime camera. >> Funny pose. I I like to use the my my uh my phone because the quality is so much better. >> Okay. That was 50 on Antropic, right? Um when you >> Yeah. So, sorry when I said you spend 80 is more than me. I did not take into account Chad GPT and uh Gemini U subscriptions. >> So, you're spending you're spending like 100. The the scary thing is is like I'm like if if my employer said, \"Oh, Kai, you're spending too much on Claude. We're not going to finance your $80.\" I feel like it's the same thing with AWS because I have my own AWS account just for like learning and doing things. And that cost me like 30 bucks a month because I can't get it lower than that because I've loaded up with some S3. So, I'm just I'm I'm a little bit worried that as a as a worker that I have to take on these costs and like my wife like bemonones me about our Netflix and all these other subscriptions if if we all if if I have to maintain an AI subscription of 100 bucks a month.…\n\n[slide:2] [3:03–9:49]\ntake on these costs and like my wife like bemonones me about our Netflix and all these other subscriptions if if we all if if I have to maintain an AI subscription of 100 bucks a month. I mean, is that is it's a bit annoying, but I guess it's worth it. But, >> bucks is Yeah, >> 100 bucks is something but like it's worth it. I mean I do feel I do feel energized and >> and motivated to get things done with with the help of AI you know never mind it like completing my code like the planning everything it really really helps at least me >> never mind it also taking on a funny thing right I was installing posgress on an EC2 instance in the Singapore AWS region and it was taking a very long time it looked like it was hanging I was using a packer build script right supposedly completely finishes in 15 minutes but just adding Postgress now it was like hanging for 10 minutes before it even like finished the Postgress installation which I put early in the installation process [gasps] and after troubleshooting it with AI for a while it just said well you know we looked we we signed in we had package generate a separate uh debug SSH key so I could log in to see to monitor the progress and we we concluded that the the transfer was just slow because we're downloading from like universal DBN packages and Um, and so it suggested a couple of mirrors, but then we had to validate because the machine was ARM and not all mirrors support ARM packages. >> And so it did some latency like we ended up writing a latency checker for the several um Singapore >> mirrors available for like DBN ports or whatever. And I ended up with like um and and then there was a an edge case where one of the mirrors maintenance page show that they were no longer supported but according to the benchmark results had like a sub millisecond latency which turned out to be a treat a redirect to an error page and so it didn't validate the the actual binary contents of of the package that was supposed to be there. Right. So it just Yeah. So it it responded 200. Okay. But the actual contents of the index was an error page. >> Yeah. So, so then we ended up with like a whole a whole script to validate mirrors for Ubuntu package for DBN packages that are ARM compatible. Uh well, any compatible because it checked the architecture of the of the u of the the kernel, right? So, so just to say like yes, AI is so exciting, but as part of my process, I ended up writing a benchmark script for [laughter] the Singapore.…\n\n[slide:3] [9:29–16:15]\njust the route 53 uh the TLS like the certificates. Um but the TLS is free, right? But it's also the uh what's it? Well, the CloudFront distribution itself. Uh what else? uh the the the route 53 like domain registration because I do have some domains via namecheep but I think it's so much easier to just go through AWS and like the cost difference make it like building >> account I guess the $30 a month I mean I'm aggregating it but it's because I maintain you know eight domains that I've never really used in my life but I still pay for them because I'm an idiot. So this this this topic will be like how to like all of the useless stuff we pay for. [laughter] >> Yeah, something like that. Um, sorry, I'm still trying to gather my thoughts. There was something I wanted to chat to you about. Um yeah, you you mentioned that like switching to plan you you don't use plan mode anymore like I I >> so so because planning is like under the spec kit where it creates a detailed multihase and then boils it down to each individual file exactly what needs to change. >> Oh this is because you spec it right? You don't need plan what you're saying. So now if I like initially when I did that I went into cloud and as usual fire up plan mode to create like a bunch of to-do items and then read the spec but what I found is that cloud sometimes just changes the plan like even though the task description are clear this is what you need to do in this file and it just goes and does something slightly different and then in the overall design things don't work anymore. I I've seen cloud do that. So I'm actually now cloud code plan mode is detrimental to my >> that doesn't sound good at all. I'm I'm plan mode. I'm plan mode all the way, man. >> That's why you start, right? But I've also the reason why I sent you that message is because I saw two or three threads on Reddit uh yesterday because with the new Opus 4.5 release, they also revised the way plan works and they said for Opus even it's worse because now OPU spends up spins up sub agents and then works off summary results and as a result doesn't get like as good a um a plan anymore. So people are complaining that >> is like a a better planning model, isn't it? >> Yes. But it spins up sub aents to explore the codebase and then works off those results which are inaccurate. So if if you were to use Opus, which is a more expensive per token cost, >> you get more you get other things you don't want with it. Is that is that what you're…\n\n[slide:4] [15:54–22:42]\nhave to install the codeex uh >> because it's a different subscription? >> But isn't Codex OpenAI and isn't and that's owned by Microsoft pretty much. But I'm paying it's different if you pay Microsoft vs code and OpenAI is still its own its own entity, right? They have a partnership and an investment. >> Oh, I see. I thought I thought there was I I assumed there there'd be some really tight integration >> because >> you know Microsoft is a customer of OpenAI like a partner and they get access to some models >> because because it is a bit of a like a maze to I mean you must spend half your day working out which extension, which optimization, which thing to to use to get the best out of your subscription. It's a nightmare if you're like a if you're in like a corporate environment, you know, I'm not I'm not even allowed to install the extension. I think uh >> uh corporate environments I'm not talking about and I'm on a corporate laptop actually, but luckily they have not locked that down. Um and this VS Code subscription is through the GitHub organization. I I I used to have my own, but I canceled it. Uh and then the company has seats, right? Um so this one is controlled by the company and okay and it can see how much each of us is using. This one is my personal codeex which of obviously if I work on company um source code that would probably not be acceptable that I am using my personal codeex with like the open eye uh plus subscription versus the VS code agreed um like you know part of the GitHub organizations we discussed. >> Yeah. Um, >> I'm just using the chat. Um, but also then you have you need to learn how to set up your workflow. I installed this codeex plugin the moment they announced it. Like, hey, we have a codeex plugin and that's it. Like, I added that in. I saw that I could paste screenshots and I was like, hey, let's, you know, I like that more. And I go between the codec cli and the plug-in however I feel like. And like I said, most of my workflow is cloud code. Um, but then sometimes because I look at my usage here and I say, \"Oops, I'm close to my weekly or whatever.\" Then I start like, \"Can I not do some of these task with Colex instead?\" >> Yeah, >> I think maybe it was maybe it was like some sort of FUD, but I saw I saw a news article or tweet that that evidently Open AI is giving free AI open AI to to India or something crazy. Did you read that or am I just am I just racist? [laughter] >> Pl the sixth on both or is it the fifth?…\n\n[slide:5] [22:22–29:09]\nfor years uh Eddie Osmani. He's he's big in the web world and I used to be big in the world. I don't know if I used to do stuff for the W3C and and browser engines in the beginning of my career and I think I'm come across Eddie Osmani then and he's still around. He's he's like a a lead at Google and he wrote an open he wrote an AI book or something. >> I think I saw I follow several Gemini CLI like core team members to find out if they are doing some improvements to the product and I think I saw somebody share this like uh Gemini CLI things as well which I was like I'm going to have to look at it but then I mean most of these are like oh this is >> yeah I know about that. you know about that. This is like use Claude >> create custom commands. I mean this >> create custom commands. Okay. Yeah. Yep. We know about that. I I to be honest I'm not as I pointed out yesterday I don't like things polluting my command space. I'd rather use um the way that Claude the way that you trigger an agent or a skill in Claude is just by text but via the prompt and it works reliably. I I I never get the feeling that oh no it's not triggering the right MCP or >> that's the weird thing about using these tools is that we are used to find menus and buttons to click on >> whereas right now in words we say something and that kind of triggers the LLM to more like oh >> and you can see that it triggered it. >> Yeah. Yeah, but the thing is like they have this thing of agents, right? But you don't really know like, oh great, there's agents. And sometimes it's like decides to use it. But you can actually just say like, oh, by the way, you know, send off uh an explore agent to go through the codebase and find wherever this might be applicable and it just spawns an agent and does that like there's no button to click, >> right? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> What's the words that I use to trigger >> me? At one time I I used agents to depend a bot merge everything in my in my 300 repos. It worked really well. Um, but I I want to kind of tie it into that because I shared with you something that I saw in the change log of cloud code and they said they improved the ask user input tool and I was like oh so that's the thing it's called it's like ask user question tool to autosubmit single select questions on the last question and so >> right so so when I saw the name of the tool now I suddenly like have maybe like son will know that if if the user says something or ask me a question about this, it will…\n\n[slide:6] [28:49–32:51]\nwhen doing these tasks. Um, and >> the whole MCP drama that is now because Entropic created it and now they're saying, \"Well, we don't do MCPS like that anymore.\" You can actually hint on your tools um with information about how to use the tool in a script so that Opus will write a script to use the tools to then execute everything in one go. That's one of the things like I I joked about yesterday with like on Facebook was like everybody wrote these MTPs with all these tools. Now you have to go and update them all because now you have to go and indicate how to use that tool in a script for >> open. Yeah, I saw your I saw your LinkedIn thing. >> Yeah, the the we talked about playright before, but every time I use playright at work, the the token limit gets gets exceeded and then it does that horrible compacting uh phase which I've now turned off. So I don't know what's going to happen now that I've turned it off thanks to you. Does it just stop? The thing about MC about playright right I think this MCP server is is is wrong. It's not good design because >> it's like one of the one of the what do you call it flagship MCPS but carry on. Well, to me after after adding playright scripts to my my you know my API with a with a web app to go through the flows user flows you know login get redirected to keycloak um sign in get back to the app then validate that you can do this but not that if depending on your group membership and things like that these type of user flows very hard to test with uh integration testing golang or something like that right because you need to parse the respon from keycloak to find the the the session token or the whatever it's complicated. So um after building those playrights flows I was really impressed with pay playright because what you get is a full trace of screenshots context like this is what what the it has like this YAML representation of a web page of the tree of the like the DOM the document object model of what are the different elements and how they're nested and what their ID >> how do you see this YAML does it spit it out >> you see it also if you if you use the dev tools Chrome MCP when you're doing like you wanted to investigate some problem in your web app, it can launch Chrome, which is way lighter than the than than the than Playright itself because Playright requires a plug-in, but Chrome can run on its own with the…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "Two developers discuss the evolving landscape of AI-assisted engineering, focusing on the practicalities of managing multiple high-cost subscriptions and the technical shifts in model behavior. They explore the transition from simple code completion to complex agentic workflows, debating whether the current reliance on these tools constitutes an addiction or a necessary evolution in productivity. The conversation provides a deep dive into infrastructure troubleshooting, the nuances of different model architectures like Opus and Sonnet, and the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem.\n\n[slide:1]\n## The rising cost of AI infrastructure\nThe financial burden of maintaining a modern AI development stack is becoming a significant consideration for individual engineers. One speaker notes that their monthly spend on the Claude API alone reached $80, a figure that surprised them given they were also paying for other services. When aggregating various subscriptions—including Anthropic, ChatGPT Plus, and Gemini—the total monthly \"AI tax\" can easily exceed $100. This is compared to traditional cloud infrastructure costs, such as a personal AWS account which might run around $30 a month for learning and hosting small projects. There is a growing concern about whether these costs should be absorbed by the individual worker or the employer, especially as the tools become indispensable for daily tasks. Despite the high price point, the speakers agree that the boost in motivation and the ability to plan complex projects makes the investment feel worthwhile.\n*\"I do feel energized and motivated to get things done with the help of AI... it really really helps at least me.\"*\n\n[slide:2]\n## Troubleshooting complex cloud deployments\nAI has moved beyond simple syntax suggestions to helping solve deep infrastructure issues, such as debugging slow package installations in specific AWS regions. One developer recounts a scenario where a Postgres installation on an EC2 instance in Singapore appeared to hang for ten minutes during a Packer build. By using AI to generate debug SSH keys and monitor the process, they identified that the delay was caused by slow transfers from universal Debian packages. The AI suggested using local mirrors but cautioned that not all mirrors support ARM packages. This led to the creation of a custom latency checker and validation script to find the most efficient, compatible mirrors. This process highlights how AI acts as a force multiplier, allowing developers to build specialized tools on the fly to solve transient environment problems that would otherwise take hours to manually investigate.\n\n[slide:3]\n## The decline of manual plan mode\nThere is a notable shift away from using the built-in \"Plan Mode\" in certain AI tools due to concerns over accuracy and model behavior. While planning was once a core part of the workflow—creating detailed multi-phase to-do lists before editing files—some developers now find it detrimental. The primary complaint is that models sometimes deviate from the established plan or change logic mid-stream, leading to inconsistencies in the overall design. Furthermore, discussions on developer forums suggest that newer model iterations may be using sub-agents to explore codebases and generate summaries to save on token costs. This orchestration approach can result in less accurate plans compared to a model that reads the entire context directly. As a result, some power users are moving toward more direct, file-specific instructions or using specialized kits that boil down changes to individual files without the overhead of a separate planning phase.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Navigating the extension and subscription maze\nThe current AI ecosystem for developers is a complex \"maze\" of VS Code extensions, CLI tools, and varying subscription tiers. Engineers often find themselves juggling multiple plugins to access specific model features, such as the ability to paste screenshots or refer to local files more effectively. A key technical distinction discussed is the difference in context windows; for instance, some VS Code integrations may only offer a 65k token context, whereas using the same model through a dedicated cloud API or CLI might provide up to 200k tokens. This discrepancy forces developers to choose their interface based on the complexity of the task. Additionally, there is the challenge of managing personal versus corporate accounts, as using a personal subscription on company source code can raise security and compliance issues. Developers must constantly evaluate which tool provides the best reasoning capabilities for a given task while staying within their usage limits.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Agentic workflows and text-based triggers\nThe evolution of AI tools is moving toward \"agentic\" behavior, where the model can autonomously spawn sub-processes to complete tasks like exploring a codebase or merging pull requests across hundreds of repositories. One speaker emphasizes a preference for text-triggered agents over traditional UI buttons and menus. In this workflow, a simple prompt can trigger an \"explore agent\" to find applicable code patterns without the user needing to click through a specialized interface. This shift requires a process of \"learning and unlearning,\" as developers must adapt to the non-deterministic nature of these tools. Improvements in tools like the \"ask user input\" feature allow for more seamless interactions, where the model can automatically submit single-select questions to keep the workflow moving. The ability to use agents for bulk tasks, such as managing dependencies across 300 repos, demonstrates the massive scale at which these tools can now operate.\n*\"It's about upskilling myself, building something real, not just like a toy project.\"*\n\n[slide:6]\n## Optimizing token efficiency with MCP\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a central topic of discussion, particularly regarding its implementation in tools like Playwright for browser-based testing. There is a critique of current MCP designs that send the entire conversation history back and forth for every individual browser action, which quickly exhausts token limits and leads to \"horrible compacting\" phases. A more efficient approach involves using models that can chain multiple tool calls into a single execution script. This allows the model to run a full trace, capture screenshots, and analyze the DOM tree (represented in YAML) in one go, rather than step-by-step. By generating a script to execute the entire flow and returning only the final result or error trace, developers can significantly reduce token usage. This method is seen as a major innovation in newer model releases, making them more cost-effective for complex integration testing and live troubleshooting of web applications."
