So that CDKF thing uh got you\nactivated. So did you what did you do\nafter hearing that news? Cuz I thought\nthat project I I was I I think we\ndiscussed this project. No one was using\nit. I mean, or what was my impression?\n>> Triggered. Triggered.\n>> Triggered.\n>> He's pushing buttons, right? This guy\nwoke up fresh. I don't know what I don't\nknow what you want to, you know, get off\nbefore we start.\n>> Okay. So, anyone who's not aware, um,\nand this is my version of the story,\nright? My my my side of the story. Um\nwhen I woke up on Thursday last week um\nIBM\nhas decided to sunset CDKTF\neven though that the week before that\nthey were all there with and um with all\nthe people from AWS and if you don't if\nyou're not aware CDKTF kind of\ncollaboration between AWS and Hashi Corp\nbecause CDK is is um is an AWS uh\ntoolkit cloud development toolkit and\nonly really successful for AWS cloud\nitself with AWS CDK there is some CDK TF\nfor Azure but you know there's bicep and\nand Google I think they they try to use\nconfig um what's it config manager or\nconfig connect it's like crossplane or\num based kubernetes based\num so yeah it was sunset to be honest I\nhave been trying to fork the repository\nand nobody did anything the repository\nhad not received any love or any\nupdates. It was still pinned to version\n1.6 of Terraform and I think they\nreleased 1.13 lately.\n>> Uh most of the features that came to\nTerraform since 1.7 and I think 1.7 is\nwhen the whole BSL fork happened uh I\nthink with 1.8.\n>> So ever since then\n>> you might as well go open tofu right at\nthis point.\n>> Absolutely. So, so the the m so after\nthe sunset event um which was posted on\nReddit and hacker news and on LinkedIn\nuh most of the comments on on Reddit\nterraform obviously was nobody's using\nit right uh no let it die right hate\nthose people why would people say that\nright and and then\n>> several of course Puli jumped on the\nopportunity it's like yeah CDKF is like\ntwo years younger than Pulumi so Pulumi\ncame out first and it was kind of like a\nhalfbaked effort from Hashi Corp to try\nand emulate what Palumi provides. I\ndon't think that's really the case. I\nmean maybe it was\n>> actually I've not used Palumi in anger\nso I don't know what to say about it.\n>> Yeah. So I did a very fun talk at DevOps\nDay Singapore about how Terraform\nHashikorp language is a horrible way for\ndevelopers to manage their\ninfrastructure and goodness that there's\nonly few other options such as Pulumi\nbut nobody used it and somebody in the\naudience obviously took offense to that\nand um told me to do a a co-presentation\nfor the AWS uh community day in\nSingapore in June and um and I got\nschooled\ncuz um I was like um this is how I have\nto do it with CDKTF and he was like oh\nin Pulumi it's literally like one line.\nOh okay. So he kind of showed me the way\nand I have to say Pulumi is impressive.\nUm the only problem is and kind of how I\nchanged my presentation because my\npresentation was all about how so much\neasier it is to use CDKTF than Terraform\nmodules. And the fact is that he was\nshowing all of my examples with Pulumi\nand they looked even easier with Pulumi.\nNo, they look the same. Let's be honest,\nthey look the same. Um so then um I\nchanged my pitch mid presentation to\nbasically say so many organizations have\nlike two to three years Terraform\nfootprint with like you know known\nautomation solutions such as Atlantis or\nGitHub workflows that are all built\naround Terraform you know security\nscanners all built around Terraform IC\nso it's very hard sell as a product\nengineer who wants to build a product\nand leverage\nyou know, a queue and a lambda and the\ntool has to be connected and you don't\ncare how, right? And you do do\nserverless. You're building this\nbeautiful API gateway with all of its\nendpoints going through ECS Fargate\ncontainers for long running jobs or\ndirectly to lambdas for a quick response\nand you don't care to learn about five\ndifferent Terraform modules with 40\ndifferent variable inputs and how do you\nconfigure an API gateway, right? So for\nserverless, you know, AWS CDK is\namazing, but you know, try to come to\nyour platform team and say, \"Yes, I know\nyou guys have this amazing Terraform uh\npull request previews and and and\nscanning code and and and all this\nstuff, but I want to use AWS CDK. I want\nand then they have to start supporting\ncloud for uh or even you know more go\ntowards them and say I want to adopt\npulley and now they have to think about\npulley um into this pipeline. Although\nthat pulley's strong point is that they\nmake um trans migration from Terraformed\nto their cloud very easy. Obviously they\nare backed by the original Terraform\nproviders. So they have a lot of\nmigration paths.\n>> Yeah. I'm just looking at Palumi now.\nThey seem to support every language\nunder the sun\n>> even YAML. Yeah, you can even put YAML\nas an input and you get uh you get\ninfrastructure as code.\n>> So do they do they have tools to to\nconvert the Terraform into into\n>> language? They have a very powerful I\nthink they can even interact with the\nterraform back end directly right so you\ncan have them side by side you don't\nneed to migrate everything immediately\nthe only problem is you have to now sign\na contract with Palumi and then you have\nto you know\n>> so you're so the big problem with Palumi\nis that it's a commercial non-free thing\nright\n>> well when when the BSL announcement came\nbasically when Hashi Corp announced that\nthe source code was uh available but not\nallowed to be used in competing compar\ncommercial platforms,\n>> the business license that they put on\nTerraform. Pulumi made a big\nannouncement how they are the real free\nversion, the real open-source\ninfrastructure as code. So, I can't\nclaim um\n>> Oh, so so they're open. Okay, hold on. I\ngot to check out the GitHub now.\nThey're open source.\n>> Yeah. And they um they also another\nfamous pro for Palumi is that SST which\nis a I think originally SST they are the\npeople that build serverless.tf TF uh\nserverless not serless.com.\n>> Yeah. SD, right?\n>> Yeah. Okay. So, so the source code is\nApache 2 licensed. Okay. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> but I'm guessing they have have a model\nbecause I see they see looks like they\nhave like a a cloud UI, right?\n>> Yeah. So, they're they're like Terraform\nCloud, right? They they give you the\nability to very quickly get started.\nJust sign up to their cloud and get your\nPulumi code ready. And the terraform\ncloud is is essentially non-free, right?\n>> Yeah. They both under management pricing\nmodels, right? I think we talked about\nthat\n>> very first time back in September when\nthere was this uh announcement of open.\n>> Okay. So, Palumi seems to be in a good\nposition to deal with the CDKTF fallout\nthen, right?\n>> Yeah. And they even have made their AWS\nCDK adapter generally available. So\nCDKTF had this in in um technical\npreview since its inception and for five\nyears it was still in technical preview\nuntil it got uh you know shut down\ntogether with CDKTF. So the the adapter\nbasically your team can write AWS CDK\ncode and the adapter converts the the\ngenerating cloud formation into pulley\nequivalents allows your teams to quickly\nconvert your AWS CDK to pulley as well.\nstill that doesn't sound quite right to\nme because even if you convert your\ncloud information to Palumi, how the\nhell are you going to, you know?\n>> Yeah, it's I think this is just a um\n>> marketing\n>> just marketing and just to allow people\nto quickly do a PC on Palumi and then\nsee the benefits of the cloud. I guess\nthere is a benefit compared to cloud\nformation, right? It's very frustrating\ncloud formation sometimes when you kick\noff a roll out and then it gets stuck\nand it does a roll back and you have to\nwait an hour and and it's it's this\ncloud for all or nothing behavior that\nis sometimes very frustrating the\nability for cloud form to you know lose\ntrack of resources if the logical ID\nchanges. So that's where like terraform\nand puli are like advantage have\nadvantages because of the the way they\ntrack state. They allow you to more\ncarefully refactor your state, but they\ndon't have this all or nothing guarantee\nlike cloud form, right? Cloud formation\nis really like a database transaction.\nYou kick off a roll out, it's going to\ngo through. If it doesn't, it's going to\ntry and roll back, which honestly also\ndoesn't always work, right? Sometimes\nthere will be something blocking it.\nYeah. And then the roll back fails. So\nthat's where people are like, oh, the\nAWS CDK is awesome. Cloud formation is\nhorrible. um and then they maybe have a\nlot of issues with like managing the\noverall teams\n>> um interaction with cloud form stack. So\npulley is in a really great position.\nThey also have SSD.\n>> So SSD originally serless were built on\ncloud form and SAML um SAM sorry not\nSAML uh SAM the\n>> yeah I'm I'm an AWS SAM guy kind of guy\nto be honest.\n>> Yeah and SST was kind of like\nreplicating SAM on top of AWS CDK. So\nyou don't have to work with the AWS CDK\nabstractions but for example you can say\nI want open next deployed as serverless\non top of lambdas. So SST gave you that\num it take care of everything like I\nwant an application right I don't care\nabout lambdas\n>> I'm just clicking around Palumi I guess\nlooks like it's done a quite a good job\nI'd say on the face of it\n>> it's just it's just the ball breaker is\nthe fact that they will\ncatch you in their in their web of the\nthe\n>> cloud costs\n>> the cloud costs\n>> so there's there's no there's no open\nsource\n>> there is cloud so\nThere was one of the uh misconceptions I\nhad as well about Pulumi was that I\nheard that it was expensive and you\ncan't self-host but you can you can move\nyour cloud hosted back end to an S3\nbucket but the the the counter to that\nis then but now you have to manage all\nof this cross team uh rolebased access\ncontrol you know all the enterprise\nfeatures that come around\n>> oh yeah software\n>> orchestration and all that sort of\nstuff.\n>> So so then you need to take that on\nyourself. Yeah. And and in that aspect\nin in the Terraform ecosystem, you have\na lot of open source projects, right?\nAnd you can choose between um Spacelift\num you can choose between Terra Team or\num you you can choose Terra Mate or\nTerra Grand or Terra Grand Scale. So\nthere's so many options around Terraform\nand for Purimi we didn't have that many.\nHowever, Spacelift and others say yes,\nyou can also manage pulley with us.\nWe're also hosting an S3 bucket and\nwe're coupling it together with your\nterraform. So, so yeah, that's that's\nwhy most of the reactions Yeah.\n>> So, the\nlet me I'm I'm just\nlet me just share my screen. I was I\njust I just want to map out where\ninfrastructure is at then.\nSorry.\nAnd then we haven't even talked about um\nsystem initiative and uh and\n>> I hope I hope to catch up with um with\nAdam at the config management camp in\nGent.\n>> Yeah, you give you a beautiful demo.\n>> Let me just trying to think.\nI don't know how to do the scale here,\nbut I was I was going to put like maybe\nthis terraform here\nand then this Palumi here\nand Palumi has seems to be the last.\n>> I would put AWS CDK all the way on the\nright. That is like the benchmark for me\n>> because it came first.\nM no I don't think I think Palumi came\nbe around the same time or at the same\ntime or little bit earlier to AWS CDK\nmaybe\n>> okay that okay so we have to pre prefix\nthis with AWS infrastructure\n>> and then I mean I was going to put it\nhere but like anyway\nso most\n>> yeah for me it goes more to the right to\npuli because because it it has this\nlittle additional library like next to\nAWS CDK Here you can put SST because\nthat is on top of poly\n>> SST.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. So I was going to maybe put use a\nscale of like I don't know features\nbecause you I mean let's be we've talked\nabout this before but you can't do\nuh well lambda and serless very easily\non the terraform level.\nSo you need something like\n>> it depends what features you're talking\nabout because features are related to\ndeveloper experience or operational\nexperience um and and how you like do\n>> um previews plan previews and things\nlike that.\n>> Well\nand rolebased access control.\n>> Um I'm thinking developer experience. I\nmean what do you mean operational\nexperience like how easy it is to to\nmanage or\n>> to refactor? uh for example let's say as\na company we start with a single\noffering and we build a VPC with like\nsome lambdas and so on and then later on\nwe spin off\n>> I would always feature agility\noperational then\n>> yeah agility\n>> yeah so so\n>> so you're you're only looking at one\ndimension operational features\n>> yeah well I I sent you the link but I\nmean be good to explore\nthe dimensions.\n>> I uh yeah, let me try and add the\ndeveloper experience dimension.\n>> So, um\n>> just bossing you around.\n>> I mean, cloud form is probably at the\nbloody bottom, isn't it? I mean, it's a\nnightmare to work with.\n>> No,\n>> cloudformation is at the same level as\nTerraform. Come on, be honest.\n>> Going to give you that.\nI've refacted Terraform plenty of time.\n>> Okay.\n>> The tooling is good. cloudformation like\nyou it's you.\n>> So we I'm going to create a separate\nscale for developer experience.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh wow. Hyperland does not\n>> I'm going to I'm going to put AWS SAM in\nthe middle just because\n>> I'm on Arch by the way. I'm going to say\nlike six times during this call.\nDo you know I started I started my\nchannel by making Archix installed\nvideos for noobs like you.\n>> No, I didn't have to install it.\n>> Oh, yeah. You're using Omar. You're\nusing uh what's it called?\n>> Omari.\n>> Omari.\n>> Yeah, that's that's how way he pronounce\nit, right?\n>> Yeah. But you were sending me\nscreenshots of Hyperland crashing or\nsomething, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's why I'm on Arch.\nfor the uh crash experiences. I think\nArch cannot run this website. Uh cannot\nrun um Xcoly draw.\n>> What?\n>> Maybe developer experience goes the\nother way or I think the same direction.\n>> What's okay define developer experience.\n>> Yeah, as a DevOps engineer you should\nknow this.\n>> Well,\n>> okay.\nBasically we are not devops engineer we\nare platform engineers and one of the\nthings that we should focus on is to\nprovide our developers the tools so that\nthey can take ownership on the services\nthat they built and run in production.\n>> Okay. Okay.\n>> And the developer experience comes with\num you know the the easiness at which\nthey can define their production\nworkloads.\n>> Yeah. So my my points of what my point\nof mental reference is like you know net\nlefi and u up cell and things like that.\n>> So essentially what what they need to\ntwiddle with is is a config yaml and uh\na CLI tool or something like that and\nthat that's it right that that's that's\nmy point of reference. Of course, so\nmany companies just do it so much more\nconvolutely convolut in a awkward way.\nFly.io.\n>> What did you say you you you called\n>> Netlfi? Netlfi.\n>> Yeah. So, they all work in a similar\nway. There's some CLI and there's some\nconfig YAML\n>> or toml.\nMaybe I should do a scale for cost\nlike or enterprise adoption or something\nlike that\nbecause some of these things like Palumi\nis going to get expensive.\nEnterprise\nI don't know. So, anything I select\ndoesn't show up on my on my browser. I\nthink there's a problem with Chromium to\nbe honest. Um, I'm on a Chromium browser\n>> on a fork\n>> and uh and doesn't render properly\nsometimes.\n>> So, Palumi is going to be expensive. I\nthink cloudformation terraform is a bit\ntricky cuz\nNo, I mean Terraform is good because you\ndon't need to pay for rum.\nNo rum.\nI think you cannot put operational\nfeatures AWS\nabove terraform\nor maybe\n>> I I mean I love it. I love it\n>> because it's backed by CFN. So you must\nhave the same problems like losing\nlogical um logical ID for resources\nloses the actual resource ownership.\nAlthough they have added a lot of new\nfeatures to cloud form to help you\nrefactor your code. But yeah, the main\nreason there is that organizations\nconstantly change the names. Oh, we did\na we we had um an offsite of the with\nthe sea level team and we decided to\nmerge our AI team with our data team and\nthen all of these resources that were AI\nteam.\n>> I love what you I love what you said uh\na few chats ago with changing of IDs.\nYou were saying that like uh you should\njust use labels, right, to address\nresources\n>> and not and use opaque IDs. I mean I\nreally that stuck with me. I need to do\nthat more.\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n>> Oh, and convince people you don't have\nto name a bloody bucket this certain\nway.\n>> And that's something that cloud form\nkind of forces upon you or AWS CDK,\nright? By default, it doesn't even allow\nyou to define the physical ID of\nresources. And it and then I had some\nsome um colleagues and they were like,\n\"No, no, this load balancer has to be\nnamed exactly like this because I need\nto be able to find it in the console.\"\nAnd I'm like, \"No,\n>> no,\n>> no.\nthen you have to deploy the same stack\ntwice and you you get an error because\nthe load balancer identity like physical\nID does already exist like\n>> you know and then I got this whole\ndiscussion with the team manager after\nthe guy that tried to do what I I\nwouldn't allow him to do raised it up to\nour our manager and then said yeah come\non Vincent we we're not deploying the\nsame application twice in the same AWS\naccount and it's like Well, yes, we are.\nAnd we are consolidating more of our\ninfrastructure. So,\n>> okay. I mean, I think you're being a\nlittle bit danty. I mean, to be honest,\nI make assumptions right now. The thing\nI'm working with and I need to make it\nuh talk to each other at some point\nsoon. Okay. So,\num yeah. Uh well, I thought I mean I\nlike to fill this void. I do think AWS\nOkay. AWS is so specific to serless,\nit's probably not worth beating around\nabout.\nUh\nI'm probably going to copy.\nThis is so difficult because the\nfunctionality is not comparable, is it?\n>> Copy it or just drag it.\n>> Oh, sorry. I meant to copy it. Hold on.\nLet me copy my\nOkay. I don't know. We've just been\ndragging things around. Maybe we should\nwe got to start somewhere. Let's\n>> say what we what we mean by this.\n>> Okay. Your developer experience.\nUm I'm I'm really surprised you put\nTerraform right rock bottom. I mean\nTerraform has an incredible developer\nexperience.\n>> No,\n>> it does.\n>> It's a horrible developer experience.\n>> It's the worst.\n>> Okay. So, okay. I I think Okay, you're\ncoming from a developer point of view.\nOkay. You're like the guy says like I\ndon't understand this. What is this TF\nfile?\n>> Why do you s make a whiny voice when\nyou're the emulator developer a product\nengineer?\n>> What I'm saying is Terraform um is\nexposing every single API resource of\nthe cloud of the SAS that you're\ninteracting with, right? Either the\ncloud provider or um you know whatever\num is it or whatever you're you're\nyou're talking to. Every single API\nendpoint must be configured and then\nmust be linked together. So if you're\nsetting up an API gateway and a lambda,\nyou must set up the IM role and the IM\npolicy to you know provide lambda\npermissions. Then you have to do you\nknow the lambda trust policy. Then you\nhave to set up lambda permissions to\nallow the gate API gateway service to\ninvoke the lambda that you have to do\nwith terapform.\n>> Yeah. And then you have to do it for\nevery possible scenario that those\nthings can be combined together, right?\n>> Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I I'm just trying\nI'm just trying to come up with the\nright word. You have to basically\n>> manage everything and it's\n>> Yeah. As a developer and many people\nalways came to me when I was purely\nTerraform only guy um and said like look\nI'm not like you. I cannot read the API\ndocs or the provider docs and figure out\nhow I need to comm connect connect all\nof these resources. Let me click ops.\nLet me go into the AWS console, click on\nthis, then click on that and then after\nthat I will try to capture everything.\n>> On the subject of click ops, is there\ngood support by any of these tools to\nbasically capture the state from from a\nfrom AWS? I think I think you should ask\nuh system initiative to give you that de\ndemo because that's one of the things\nthat he's advertising right like look\npeople have clicked and now you have to\nyou know control it so here you go\nsystem initiative doing that for you is\nthere anything that does that really\nnicely\n>> I don't think so I don't think any of\nthese tools help you fix whatever\nsomebody clicked in clicks up still in\nbut\n>> some of these tools allow you to avoid\nclickups to basically start the correct\nway um by defining it with SSD because\nthey give you that ability to say like I\nhad a gateway.\n>> I mean I I got a soft spot for click ops\nin a way just because I was on a\n>> I was on a job and it took it took me\nliterally like a week just just to\ntoggle something. Wow. I'm I'm\nexaggerating, but it took a while.\n>> And I thought to myself,\n>> yeah, absolutely. So that's the problem\nwith a lot of these infrastructure as\ncode libraries is that they're built\nfrom um a very low-level perspective and\nyou can either and a lot of the tools\nthat are being built right now is to you\nknow reflect the reality of this\nnature of the cloud changing things\nunder the hood right if you create an\nRDS instance it's going to auto upgrade\nto the latest Postgress version and then\nyour Terraform's going to go like nope\nthis is supposed to be Postgress 15.\nWhat are you doing running Postgress 18\nover there? You know, let's delete this\ndatabase and recreate it.\n>> Yeah, actually\n>> dealing with dealing with data and any\nof these tools makes me a bit sweaty\n>> like uh\nwhat happened.\n>> That's interesting because that's\nexactly the argument that somebody made\njust now on a thread on Reddit because\nI'm I'm 24 hours on Reddit obviously. um\nthat\nhe just made the argument that the only\nplace you would use something like\nTerraform is to manage databases.\n>> What?\n>> Yeah. Because he says like everything\nelse is so dynamic and most of the stuff\nyou shouldn't be doing with IC. IC\nshould be done for these like um\nresources that take need additional like\noperational\n>> Okay, maybe he's got a point because\nit's got it's got more\n>> control\n>> stability aspects to it. Yeah. Yeah,\nbecause you're right. You do a because\nwith IC it's often very close to\nGitHubs, right? You need to make a\nsource code change,\n>> bring it to production.\n>> We're using Terraform to manage some\ndata right now and and uh our basically\none of our main guard rails is the plan,\nbut no one reads the plan. No one reads\nthe plan. Like we like we got like a\nnice GitHub summary to say like, oh, do\nyou know you're recreating resources\nhere?\nand they just go, \"Yeah, whatever.\nApply.\"\n>> That's weird because like first off, why\nis it recreating resources? That means\nthat and that's the hard thing about\nTerraform.\n>> Well, I I didn't want to mention the I\ndidn't want to mention the provider, but\nI'm I'm going to mention it. It's not\ngoing to incriminate anyone, but this\nthe we've been working with the snow\nsnowflake provider and it just wants to\nrecreate things very easily, but it it's\nit's it's a complicated environment to\nbe honest.\n>> Yeah. Some providers have really low\nquality.\n>> Yeah. And the snowflake one is in\nmaybe someone has made a video about it,\nbut it's it's it's came out of like I it\ncame out of like the uh the Chan\nZuckerberg Foundation or something like\nthis. It's hasn't been maintained very\nwell. Then Snowflake itself eventually\nadopted it.\n>> LOL. Oh, that's so funny. I I I used and\nthere's so many experimental features in\nit, it makes you very nervous. I mean,\nand then Snowflake is only used by the\nlike the biggest enterprises ever.\n>> Wow.\n>> We It's a very It's a very weird setup,\nbut I guess it is it is better than\nmanaging it by by hand, I like to think.\nBut still at the end of the day the the\nprovider just seems to do SQL calls or\nor like it it it lacks so much\nfunctionality you're ending up having to\nwrite these like what do you call like\nSQL execute blocks here and there and\neverywhere which\n>> yeah so so this is kind of where I feel\nwhen I started on my Terraform journey I\nwas like terraform everything right you\ncreate an RDS instance you need a\ndatabase in it well we're going to\ndefine the terraform provider for\nPostgress and we're going to connect it\nto your RDS instance and we're going to\ncreate a database and we're going to\ncreate the plug the extensions that need\nto be active on that database and it's a\nnightmare because now when you ever you\nrun Terraform you have to have a tunnel\nto connect to the Postgress instance and\nyou know once you start doing compliance\nyou need you need all types of security\naround that and and this is the type of\nstuff that it shouldn't be part of\nTerraform right like running SQL queries\nthrough a provider just to me already\nafter using it for 10 years seems\nsomething like done that been there\nnever again you know\n>> yeah okay I think we all agree I agreed\nI'm agreed with this whole developer\nexperience at the bottom here um\n>> convinced you\n>> but but at the same time the things that\nwe put at the very top don't really I\nmean that's for very narrow use cases I\nfeel like we need to have maybe two axis\nat this point because we we need\nwe We need like oh god\none access to sort of\nwe need we need the vertical access to\ntalk about um what you can do like you\nknow AWS\nfeature\n>> but that's what the defex or what\n>> scope or something like well like the\ntrouble is is that versal is good at\nsetting up a website but you can't like\nrun a database So I mean probably I mean\nmaybe it does support database\n>> because is this as a higher level\nabstraction right?\n>> Yeah. So I understood. So so basically\nit needs to go down\nyou know it needs to sink down here.\nWell well with with\n>> you just moved you just moved my devx uh\nscale to the right saying feature scope\nand and you just\n>> and then here I would say de dev\nexperience because we need to basic okay\nwe can discuss this later. I think your\nfeature scope is the devx and your your\nx-axis should be the operational\nfeatures that we we were just talking\nabout\n>> because because the feature scope here\nlike Versel has um great Devx so it\nneeds to go up there but horrible\noperational experience such as like I\nneed fine grain control to bootstrap a\ndatabase I can't do that because first\nis very high level and under the hood\nit's going to create some type of data\nstore and they take care of it which is\nlike a trade-off right\n>> yeah they're going to you like three\ndifferent types of data store and you\ndon't care how they're\n>> Yeah, you're right. You're right. The\noperational stuff comes. Yeah. Yeah.\nYou're right. You're right. You're\nright. I didn't know what SST v2 is.\nWhat the hell is that? That's just\nserverless, isn't it?\n>> So, basically the the way I understand\nit cuz I only came became familiar with\nSSD when my my friend introduced it to\nme. Um originally I think the server the\npeople that built serverless.com\nthey created um SSD on top of AWS CDK. I\nthink serverless was using SAM and maybe\ncloud form directly and then they with\nsome scripting around it and then they\ncreated um SST which is just instead of\ndirectly writing cloud form they would\njust leverage all of AWS CDK because AWS\nCDK is this amazing library that gives\nyou these beautiful integration\npatterns. If you need to create a lambda\nand a gateway and you just connect it to\nit's going to take care of everything,\nright? So you don't have to generate\nevery single cloud for resource, you\njust say here.\n>> So it's like a it's another sort of\nCDK/palumi\ntype type offering, right?\n>> No, it's it's on top of so originally it\nwas on top of cloud for then they\nrewrote it on top of um on on on AWS CDK\nand then they rewrote it on top of FUMI.\nSo SSD is like the AWS CDKL2s. Um but\nthey're trying to go like like Versel\nkind of in the middle.\n>> They are.\n>> Oh, we don't have Palumi on this top\nthing. I mean Palumi needs to be up here\nor something. I don't know.\n>> You're you're like yeah I was trying to\nduplicate it but it didn't manage to\nduplicate it. So yeah, Palumi and SST on\noperational I think there would be the\nsame.\nOkay.\n>> Yeah, SSTV1 was on AWS CDK and SSTV2 is\non top of Pulumi. Um, so\n>> how do you get exposure to all this\nstuff, man? I feel like I'm doing a lot\nand I don't get to touch some things.\nOkay. I guess you attend a lot of talks,\ndon't you?\nIt was my colleague uh sorry my ex-\nflatmate who um who who pivoted you know\noriginally started with Amplify then\nwith AWS CDK and then he says you know\nSSD is this amazing thing.\n>> Oh my god. Amplify. Oh my god. Sweet\nJesus.\n>> Yeah. But Amplify also completely wrote\nitself on top of AWS CDK. Yeah. And then\nthey just became like uh this portal\nthat you it's kind of like I think AWS\nanswer to Versel. This basically like\nallows you to create your front end to\ndeploy it.\n>> Yeah. That's true. That's true. But I I\nnever appreciated the stack.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, they completely changed the stack\nbecause originally amplify was doing\ncloud formation and now it's just doing\nlike CDK stacks and then it's just\nallowing you to manage your front-end\ndeployments, you know, your S3 contents\nand your CDN configuration from an\nabstract level. A bit like Versel really\nlike I think amplify is really like\nVersell.\n>> No, I think I think Vel is much better\nthan amplify.\n>> When was the last time you looked at\namplify? uh years ago and I I had I\nthink I think I have a GitHub project\nabout it and then it was impossible to\nlike just maintain it. So basically,\n>> yes, I know that's what amplify used to\nbe. But what I there was this uh lady\nwho posted on LinkedIn access to a Udemi\nworkshop that she had just published\nwhich was AWS AWS CDK and Amplify. And I\nand for free you got access for like two\ndays or something like that. And so I I\ndid a speedrun through it like literally\nin a day just crushed it. And um I went\nthrough the whole AWS CDK thing and the\nAmplify side of things. And this\nliterally just like a month ago, not two\nmonths ago.\n>> Yeah. And and it's really like amplify\nwhen I looked at it and I haven't used\nforcell but um it really is like oh I\nwant to do blue green experiment. Oh I\nwant to do this. It just takes care of\neverything under the hood for you and\nyou you just go here's my website source\ncode and it just take care of the whole\n>> anyway. So we can put bloody amplify\nhere. Gez.\n>> Yeah. Amplify V2 or whatever. Amplify\ncurrent\nwhatever\nnew one. Okay.\nSo,\nokay. So, now now if we\nand how do we account for the the cost\nof things? I guess let's let's just\nfocus on operational features and and\nDevX. Can are you able to copy and paste\ninto this one so that we have a a better\ngraph here? or shall I just do it?\n>> Uh, yeah. No, my my my Chromium is un\nunresponsive.\n>> Okay, so if I maybe I put Terraform on\nthe bottom here.\nCloudformation too. God, it's got a\nterrible experience.\nPalumi\nlooks like it can do a lot.\nWait, it's going to look the same, isn't\nit?\nIt's going to look the same. There's no\nthere's no DevX and operational features\nseems to be the same thing, right?\n>> I mean, Palumi and Palumi cloud I guess\nand Terraform and Terraform cloud maybe.\nUh\nso Palumi I would I would pose in terms\nof operational features a bit higher\nthan Terraform and in terms of DevOps\nkind of in the middle. Um but but\nultimately I can't help but think\nthere's no the major differentiator\nshort is going to be is just going to be\nit's just going to be price isn't it? We\nyou you like if you were like a an enter\nlike a Fortune 500 company,\nyou're not going to use um\nwell, you can't you can't use VEL and\nand things cuz that's not going to be\nenough\nand\nyou're not going to use AW CDK and\nTerraform is as we know limited.\nBut then you're gonna you're gonna\nbasically pay for Palumi. Okay, this I'm\nnot too sure where I'm going with this.\n>> Okay, I\n>> I also wanted to tie this into AI\nsomehow, but it just it look it looks\nlike Palumi is in a very good spot. And\nwe haven't even talk about we haven't\neven talked about Kubernetes, but I\ndon't want to talk about Kubernetes.\nLooks like Palumi is is on a I don't\nknow if can can we invest in Palumi?\nLooks like it's in a really good spot.\n>> Are you building a tech radar? Maybe I\nshould pull up the some famous tech\nradar.\nUm, hold on. Uh, what was I? Ah, AWS\nCDK.\n>> Not on the current edition.\n>> I would give AWS CDK highdevx but very\nlow operational experience. And then SST\ngiven it's on on Palumi would be a\nlittle bit less on the DevX side because\nthey don't they didn't build all the\nsame like service levels but on the same\nlevel as Palumi in terms of operation\nbecause it lose uses Palumi under the\nhood. Yeah.\nWhat else is there?\nDoes it make sense?\nWhere are you? I don't see you anymore.\n>> I'm here. I'm here. I was just looking\nat um Oh.\nWhat the Why does it say data dog?\n>> What the I\n>> I was just I was just looking at the uh\n>> I think you're on this\n>> the tech radar.\nThe thing the only thing it says on\nplatform to adopt is uh ARM in the\ncloud. which sounds a bit weird\nsometimes. I wonder if these people that\nmake those T radars really know what\nthey're talking about.\nI don't know where which one you're\nlooking at, but like I'm just guessing\nnow.\nUh,\nokay. Let's tie this back to AI. So we\nwe just riffed about how\nPalumi ST is is in a good spot. We we\nOh, we should we should put system\ninitiative somewhere here, right?\n>> Maybe you can take this this slide back\nwhen you talk to Adam from system\ninitiative where you put it.\n>> I'm not that I'm not that happy here,\nbut like okay, what okay say you're the\nwhat do you call it? the chief\ntechnology officer of a of a big company\nthat that had a whole bunch of AWS\naccounts\n>> only AWS.\n>> Let's say it's only AWS. Just just to\nkeep the conversation sane.\n>> Yeah.\n>> How would you begin to manage it? Like\nlet's even go even more bizarre. Let's\nsay like, oh Vincent, we need to build\nup to 100 accounts and we need to do\nthis in the space of six months.\nand or three months and you choose the\ntechnology to do it with can I assume\nthat Vincent would choose Palumi\nand there's no budget I mean\n>> it would be between Palumi and or\nbetween SST and AWS CDK yes if there's\nno budget limitation\nmaybe more towards SST then\n>> but SST doesn't have a a cloud and man\nand governance and or\n>> I think they may have runners but They\nthey basically\noriginally SSD they had their own like\ndeployment pipelines but since they\ncompletely pinned themselves on pulley I\nwould imagine that they are completely\npowered by Palumi deployments.\n>> Okay it sounds like Palumi. So okay so\nyou would explain once once more why SST\nand and and Palumi and AWS CDK and cloud\nfor what the relationship is right you\nunderstand AWS CDK. So AWS CDK is to\ncloud formation what SST is to pull. In\nother words, Pulumi gives you the\nlow-level concept of an IM role, an IM\npolicy and a bucket and an API gateway\nand a lambda. And then SST gives you the\nconcept of I have an um an API gateway\nthat's backed by a lambda and write\n>> higher level patterns, right?\n>> Yeah. SSD level two level threes and\n>> yeah and then and then Puni they have\ntwo different providers they have the\npure terraform provider converted on top\nof their own engine so they they run the\nengine the configuration that you\nprovide is in programming language or\nYAML or whatever they they run that\ninside a runtime they convert your\nprogram into configuration that then\ngets um executed right so if if you look\nat it like cdktf I to me pum and CDKTF\nis very similar um is that you write\nTypeScript code or Golang code or Python\ncode and it generates configuration for\nthe Terraform provider and PUMI their\ninternal representation of whatever that\ncloud plug-in is right if they targeting\nAWS it's a plug-in for AWS this they\noriginally just ported the provider AW\nfor Terraform for AWS right PMI was just\nporting the Terraform provider and then\nbuilding a programmatic interface on top\nof it I think they may like refactored\nthe way that that works because now they\nhave all kinds of hooks system. So while\nyou are your program is executing some\nof your program execution is happening\nwhile it's deploying things inside the\ncloud. So if you look at Terraform, you\nyou have a configuration and then the\nprovider is executing the configuration\nand then the provider is you know config\nlike sending the request to the API do\nthis then send the request to the API do\nthis right and Terraform\ndoes not really have a lot of features\nthat allows you to mit deployment\nexecute this function and then based on\nthe output do something else right by\ndesign because originally Terraform was\nmeant to be very deterministic very\npredict predictable so that you are able\nto to know this is the exact\nconfiguration what I want all of these\nresources to look right right but with\npulley you have like this on on event\ntype of things um you can you can hook\ninto the process and if you're deploying\nto a region that only has two\navailability zones you automatically\nlike um adjust the configuration towards\nit right so yeah so pulley has these\nlike events um and I think AWS CDK has\nsimilar things because while you are you\nknow as as a as a product engineer\ndefining this is what I need to deploy.\nIt will also hook into the target\nenvironment depending on how you are um\ncalling the the constructs. They can\nbasically decide that okay I I just I\njust downloaded the whole VPC setup. I\nknow there's two subnetss and they are\ninto the these these availability zones.\nI know all of this information which is\ncalled the context of the environment\nthat you're deploying into and they can\nreconfigure or generate cloud form\nstacks accordingly.\n>> I didn't even I've never written a CDK\nlike that. Um\n>> yeah that's that's what context\nproviders do and and then to make sure\nthat still deterministic that context\nthat was used to basically determine how\nthe uh cloudformation stack is generated\nis also stored on disk. So you can then\nput that into your GitHub um into your\nversion control sorry git and then you\ncan um you know rerun the context lookup\nto update your context. So then if you\nwant to change things for example maybe\nmaybe one day you are targeting\nSingapore region and it only has two\navailability zones uh but the next time\nSingapore introduced the third\navailability zone and you don't want all\nof your cloudformation\n>> you're blowing my mind here CDK you\nwould check in something into your in\n>> the context yes so so\n>> I've never seen that done I mean the CDK\nis all managed in cloudformation\nis how I understood it\n>> CD no CDK generates cloudformation but\nin the process of generating cloud form.\nIt can do some callouts to your\nenvironment to determine how to best\ngenerate the cloudformation.\n>> Do you have an example of a context\nchecked into Git? I guess it's all going\nto be\n>> Yeah, the one that I I was just talking\nabout and the example that they give why\nyou should checking your context is\nexactly what I just said like let's say\nthat the new availability zone is\nintroduced and that kind of like deter\nsubnetting logic that you have a whole\nlike subnet for this particular tier of\nof of your\n>> blowing my mind. I didn't really know\nabout this context. I have I have to\nlook it up. And then and then and then\nwhen you do CDK bootstrap it it creates\nlike three different bloody places for\nthings or something if I remember\ncorrectly.\n>> Yes. because CDK is very enterprise\nfocused allowing you to exactly control\nhow to um you know how the the the\nbootstrap happens right like what are\nthe basically CDK has this asset\nbundling pipeline and that's why it\nbootstraps so many things because if you\ndo terraform you just need to find a way\nfor example to put an object into a S3\nbucket so that your lambda can point to\nit and then deploy the source code from\nthe S3 object or maybe your lambda wants\nto be deployed from a docker image so\nyou need to use ECR So these asset\nrepositories uh the ECR and the S3\nbucket are very important in the way\nthat you deploy your code and this is\nmore important if you do serverless\nbecause you know you have all of these\nsnippets of of of code that that need to\nbe coordinated together with your Lambda\num configuration and the environment\nvariables and everything right so AWS\nCDK has a built-in asset pipeline and\nand and part of the things that it\nbootstrap is all of the necessary\nsupporting um architecture for that\nasset pipeline it will create an ECR\nrepository so that it you know, so that\nthey can build a Docker image part of\nthe, you know, bundling aspect of your\nof your application and then deploy that\nthat Docker image in or push that Docker\nimage into the um into ECR the asset\nregistry for Docker images or you know\npush the bucket maybe which is an ES ES\nbuild bundled NodeJS with all of its\ndependencies and whatever AWS SDK is\nexternal needs to be external because\nthat's provided within the runtime. So\nall of that is taken care of by AWS CDK\nbecause it has this beautiful asset\npipeline, right?\n>> Well, I noticed it in one in my\nworkplace that when AWCDK deploys this\nFargate pattern or whatever, it's\nbuilding the Docker image in the same\npipeline. And I thought to myself,\n>> yeah,\n>> that's not cool.\n>> It depends. So as soon as the Docker\nfile build fails with some rate limit,\nthen then the whole deployment fails.\nThat's a joke in my opinion.\n>> Uh to be honest,\nif you are coming from a developer\nexperience perspective, not being\nbothered by how exactly your code gets\nbundled up and and made available to be\ndeployed is kind of a feature that you\nwant and that's why they have it, right?\nThis asset pipeline thing. From looking\nback when I started with AWS and\nTerraform, I very strictly said, okay,\nyour code, for example, your website and\nyour bundle, the way that like assets\nare getting deployed is very\ndisconnected from your infrastructure,\nright? Classically,\n>> I'm not so sure I'm a big believer that\nbecause because these things,\n>> it's wrong. What I just said is wrong.\nWhen you start out, you think like I\nhave a very very strict separation\nbetween infrastructure and the code\nbecause my infrastructure is, for\nexample, my Kubernetes cluster. It's my\nS3 bucket and my cloud cloudfront uh CDN\nsetup, but the actual website that's\nmanaged by the product team that need to\nbe deployed and rebuilt is decoupled\nfrom it. Right.\n>> Exactly. Exactly.\n>> Exactly. And that's wrong.\n>> What? absolutely wrong because if you're\ndoing um actual DevOps culture two pizza\nteam where you have site reliability\nengineer as part of the product team the\nwhole deployment process belongs to the\nproduct team not to the infrastructure\nteam.\n>> Yeah. Okay. Okay. But there's more to it\nbecause you don't want a product team to\nmanage Kubernetes. But okay.\n>> Why? I mean like sure you don't want\nthem to damage to manage Kubernetes.\nThat's where you as a platform team are\nprovisioning the the the Kubernetes and\nthe integration points like the\nKubernetes endpoint where they need to\ntarget their deployments towards, right?\n>> But we're not talking about Kubernetes\nhere, right? We were talking about an S3\nbucket and the contents of that S3\nbucket or a lambda and the contents of\nthat lambda together with like let's\nimagine that you're you're deploying\nthis API gateway like this magic. I feel\nlike we need another scale about how the\nhow the organ how the organization is\ndone like if it's if it's like team team\ntopology or whatever.\n>> Yes. Because that's what a lot Ben\nIsraeli figured out after he left AWS\nand why AWS CDK works so well in in AWS\nbut doesn't work in other organizations\n>> because\n>> because in AWS they have a two pizza\nteam they have an S sur uh as part of\nthe team. The team is responsible for\nall of the observability for every\npaging alert that happens. It goes to\nthe product team. They are deploying 100\ntimes a days. They get the alerts. They\nhave their their product uh you know\nreliability and their runbooks.\nEverything is managed by the team. But\nin a lot of organizations there's still\na very strict separation where you have\na security team responsible for the IM\nroles and other team responsible for\nother things and that's where team\ntopologies are are are then making it\nobvious.\n>> Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I'm I'm been\nworking with strict separation, you\nknow, separation of duty type outfits\nfor like a decade now. So, I'm pretty\nI'm pretty like\nI don't know how to describe I I I don't\neven know what it's like to be in an\nautonomous team anymore.\n>> Yeah. So, so\n>> it's it's crazy that AWS can do that in\na way considering you know\n>> you know where I like\n>> very nicely and a public artifact of\nthis as an example as part of AWS CDK\nand the the whole CDK ecosystem they\nbuilt this thing called the construct\nhub. So the construct helper if you go\nto constructs.dev\nI think it is is a place that you can\nfind every single construct that was\nbuilt and remember constructs are\nusually you know L2s or L3s built by the\ncommunity. Yeah. Constructs.dev. So\nthese are amazing. Um\nthey are they're like the terapform\nmodule registry but instead they it\ndoesn't cover a niche technology by one\ncompany IBM. um and then pedled by other\ncompanies like Spacelift. Instead, this\nis using registry of .NET, Golang, Java,\nPython, TypeScript and its best-in-class\num you know artifacts or yeah artifactor\num artifact registries. So across all of\nthese so so this construct hub is a\ncomplete public GitHub repository and if\nyou go to that public repository of the\nsource code of the construct hub you see\nthat it's a massive serverless\napplication um basically there's um\nthere's\nwhat is it it's it's a kinesis stream\nsubscription or it's a stream\nsubscription\n>> to npmgs\nuh publish published packages right so\nso if you go to the source\num you can find and the reason this is\npublic is because you can deploy this\nwithin your organization. So it tells\nyou exactly how you can operate this\nwithin your organization. For example,\nyou have your own private registry of\nnpm your own net registry that you don't\nwant to be public and you want to make\nit this construct hub available within\nyour enterprise you can do that and and\nit has documentation with guide books\nexactly what is the alert that's set up\nlike there's a backup bucket uh in in a\nseparate region. So if a region is down,\nall of your registry downloads are still\navailable in a separate region and this\nis how you do a failover and this is how\nyou do that. These docs are amazing. So\nwhen I saw this, I was like now I\nunderstand how a product team can build\nsomething and has like very detailed\nruntime guidelines on on how to observe\nand react to alerts and why that alert\nexists because it creates all of the\nCloudatch alerts. It tells you exactly\nwhy the alert is triggering and how to\nhandle that that instance. So that's on\none side like a two pizza team. You want\nto see a beautiful implementation or a\nproduct delivered by a two pizza team,\nyou look at the construct hub. It's I\nlooked at it, it was amazing.\n>> So I mean these the these people the two\npizza team has to be like super mature\nto take take on all these\nthis uh this responsibility I suppose.\nBut mean but meanwhile most most\ncompanies are designed to to silo\nresponsibility for for lots of good\nreason\n>> because once you start talking about\ncompliance and and those initiatives\nthen now you need to align and you need\nto like do across all of your your teams\nyou need to make sure that the the\ntechnology they are using are are are\nsimilar so that you can push through\nhuge initiatives. you know, you have\nhave one team doing it like this and\nanother team doing it all on on Google\nCloud, you know, it's it's extremely\ndifficult difficult to get like um\ncompliant and I guess like AWS is really\ngood at that as well. Um but most\nenterprise main main you know business\nis not about doing all of that, right? I\nmean AWS is a company providing cloud\nservices and they they are building\ncloud services and they have a great\nteam to build cloud services. So that\nmakes sense.\nMost companies the DevOps um you know\ntype of of of initiatives are\npart of an operational team that is\nshort staffed and that needs uh\nalignment across the teams and centrally\ncontrolled and um and that's where team\ntopologies come in right. So, so which\nso which tooling by that explanation\nwould they gravitate to in your opinion?\nI believe with with things like AWS CDK\nand Construct Hub, you can have a\nplatform team that builds really\npowerful constructs for the rest of the\norganization. constructs that make sure\nthat the the patterns used by the\nproduct teams are supported and can be\neasily integrated within compliance\ninitiatives and and zero trust and all\nthose you know crossorganizational\num effort that you don't want to go\nthrough every team and try to fix them\nup. You want to give them an approved\nand and rubber stamped.\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what happens in my\ncurrent gig right now. We create\nconstructs for for other teams to use.\n>> Yes. And and that requires your platform\nteam not to come from pure operational\nbackground, right? requires your con\nyour platform team to understand how to\ndo object-oriented programming, how to\ndefine an interface, how to integrate\nthat like iterate on that interface, how\nto do you know contracts across teams,\nhow to test against those contract\ncontracts and then you come to an\norganization that's using Terraform\nbecause the old system administrators\nthat like config files never wrote uh\nactual object oriented interface or\nwhatever and then they cannot deal with\nCDK. they cannot deal with like all of\nthese like program.\n>> Yeah. Well, we we tr we uh\n>> I I sound because I'm I'm a bit\nfrustrated because I was in a lot of\nthose things where I try to to introduce\nthis and and I always get like the\nfeedback like you know Terraform is\nsimple why do you make it so complicated\nbut in reality Terraform is not simple\nand one year down the line two years\ndown the line you have Terraform modules\nthat have such a complex interface\nthere's no testing because you have\nnever thought about like actual software\ntesting on your infrastructure as code\nOkay, cool. But you're actually doing\ninfrastructure as\n>> comp. We need and we need to wrap up in\nfive minutes. I need to run out and drop\nmy kids off to school. But like\n>> but just on this point\nuh you you develop constructs for for\nfor um for other people in your\norganization to use, right?\nBut but the trouble is the trouble is is\nthat\num\nlet me just get this clear. Do you\nexpect people to use your constructs via\na config.yaml or do you expect them to\nuse like a a like a Python uh library or\nsomething?\n>> Yeah. So I think there's very different\npersonas. Um, and I think as a platform\nteam, what you should be building\nmaybe exposes a flat interface like a\nYAML, but I don't like YAML. At least it\nshould be JSON schema type YL so that\nthey get an error if they use a field\nthat is not there, right? You can do\nYAML uh\n>> with JSON schema or use most companies\nuse pedantic. Pedantic\n>> pedantic on YAML. I never tried that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> But how does pedantic work? It must must\nhave some type of schema for the data\nstructure behind it.\n>> Yeah. So so basically pedantic if I\nunderstand correctly\nit uh it has its own model. So so the\nthe you the way they use pedantic is\nthat you you read in that YAML and then\nyou compare it against the model and the\nmodel is very powerful. You know you can\nyou can express anything in that model.\n>> Okay. And then the model basically tells\nyou if if it's um yeah how what what all\nthe configs going to be and and if the\nconfig yl is valid and\n>> s so forth and it's used a lot.\n>> Yeah. So what the way I handled like the\nproblem with YAML with it being so\nunstructured is that we use YAML often\nas an input for generating\num well if you put it on top of\nTerraform you can do the Terraform plan\npreview to see how how messed up you did\nwhen you agreed to it.\n>> But it it sounds like such a this whole\nthis whole area with the governor. Okay,\nI do want to bring this back to we I\nguess we can continue but like what what\nwhat of all these technologies that we\nsort of try to map out here badly what\ndo you think AI is going to help any of\nthese problems that we have at the\nmoment like the teams\nthe devx\ndid\n>> so I did a podcast about a year ago\nabout the AI and the infrastructure and\nThey compared it as a new way of doing\nclick ops. Basically, you just have\nthese rampant LLMs just going around\ncreating things across different areas\nwhere you have no idea. So the main\npoint of bringing AI to an organization,\nI think we might have talked about this\nalready was that we need to guide the AI\nwith rules and sandboxes and there's\nseveral organization like several um\ntool tooling suppliers like stackpack\nthat are focused on.\n>> So basically basically we're going to be\nin this area in AI\nWe're we're we're headed to the\ngovernance\nside of things.\n>> Uh yeah, I mean in a way it's like you\nsee what Cloud Skills is doing and and\nnow Kira superpowers. It's all about\ngiving the LLM directions, right? And\nand and right now they're generic, but\nI'm sure a lot of organizations adopting\nAI are are creating internal rules,\nright? They're saying okay uh if you're\nusing cloud use our rules use our skills\ndirectory internally within our\norganization. What kind of rules would\nthere be? Like use\n>> if you want to deploy the integration\npoints for a VPC are in this repository.\nDon't create a VPC for scratch. There's\nan existing one and this is how you find\nthe information about it. Right? Our\ningress is handled through our CDN layer\nand uh we must follow these rules so on\nright like the platform team uh are\nhere. This is the registry where you can\nfind information about the different\nintegration points. as a product team,\nyou're going to have to integrate into\nthe platform team or the cloud.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that that makes\nsense, but I'm just thinking aloud that\num\nhow is this actually governed? So,\nso you have the rules and and you and\nlike say say u a product team. Oh\nI need to go. But okay, we need to pick\nup here. We need to pick up here about\nhow AI is going to work in a typical\norganization. Why did we end up talking\nabout this? Because you asked me about\nCDKTF and I just went on my classic\nrant.\n>> Yeah, we can we can reflect. Okay, I\nI'll catch up with you in a bit.

So did you what did you do\n[0:18] after hearing that news? Cuz I thought\n[0:20] that project I I was I I think we\n[0:23] discussed this project. No one was using\n[0:25] it. I mean, or what was my impression?\n[0:29] >> Triggered. Triggered.\n[0:30] >> Triggered.\n[0:34] >> He's pushing buttons, right? This guy\n[0:35] woke up fresh. I don't know what I don't\n[0:38] know what you want to, you know, get off\n[0:40] before we start.\n[0:43] >> Okay. So, anyone who's not aware, um,\n[0:45] and this is my version of the story,\n[0:47] right? My my my side of the story. Um\n[0:51] when I woke up on Thursday last week um\n[0:54] IBM\n[0:55] has decided to sunset CDKTF\n[0:59] even though that the week before that\n[1:01] they were all there with and um with all\n[1:03] the people from AWS and if you don't if\n[1:05] you're not aware CDKTF kind of\n[1:07] collaboration between AWS and Hashi Corp\n[1:09] because CDK is is um is an AWS uh\n[1:12] toolkit cloud development toolkit and\n[1:15] only really successful for AWS cloud\n[1:18] itself with AWS CDK there is some CDK TF\n[1:22] for Azure but you know there's bicep and\n[1:26] and Google I think they they try to use\n[1:28] config um what's it config manager or\n[1:31] config connect it's like crossplane or\n[1:33] um based kubernetes based\n[1:38] um so yeah it was sunset to be honest I\n[1:42] have been trying to fork the repository\n[1:44] and nobody did anything the repository\n[1:47] had not received any love or any\n[1:49] updates. It was still pinned to version\n[1:52] 1.6 of Terraform and I think they\n[1:54] released 1.13 lately.\n[1:56] >> Uh most of the features that came to\n[1:58] Terraform since 1.7 and I think 1.7 is\n[2:02] when the whole BSL fork happened uh I\n[2:05] think with 1.8.\n[2:06] >> So ever since then\n[2:08] >> you might as well go open tofu right at\n[2:11] this point.\n[2:12] >> Absolutely. So, so the the m so after\n[2:15] the sunset event um which was posted on\n[2:19] Reddit and hacker news and on LinkedIn\n[2:21] uh most of the comments on on Reddit\n[2:23] terraform obviously was nobody's using\n[2:27] it right uh no let it die right hate\n[2:30] those people why would people say that\n[2:32] right and and then\n[2:35] >> several of course Puli jumped on the\n[2:37] opportunity it's like yeah CDKF is like\n[2:39] two years younger than Pulumi so Pulumi\n[2:42] came out first and it was kind of like a\n[2:46] halfbaked effort from Hashi Corp to try\n[2:49] and emulate what Palumi provides. I\n[2:51] don't think that's really the case. I\n[2:53] mean maybe it was\n[2:55] >> actually I've not used Palumi in anger\n[2:57] so I don't know what to say about it.\n[3:00] >> Yeah. So I did a very fun talk at DevOps\n[3:03] Day Singapore about how Terraform\n[3:06] Hashikorp language is a horrible way for\n[3:10] developers to manage their\n[3:11] infrastructure and goodness that there's\n[3:14] only few other options such as Pulumi\n[3:16] but nobody used it and somebody in the\n[3:18] audience obviously took offense to that\n[3:20] and um told me to do a a co-presentation\n[3:23] for the AWS uh community day in\n[3:25] Singapore in June and um and I got\n[3:29] schooled\n[3:31] cuz um I was like um this is how I have\n[3:34] to do it with CDKTF and he was like oh\n[3:37] in Pulumi it's literally like one line.\n[3:40] Oh okay. So he kind of showed me the way\n[3:43] and I have to say Pulumi is impressive.\n[3:46] Um the only problem is and kind of how I\n[3:50] changed my presentation because my\n[3:51] presentation was all about how so much\n[3:53] easier it is to use CDKTF than Terraform\n[3:56] modules. And the fact is that he was\n[3:59] showing all of my examples with Pulumi\n[4:01] and they looked even easier with Pulumi.\n[4:03] No, they look the same. Let's be honest,\n[4:05] they look the same. Um so then um I\n[4:09] changed my pitch mid presentation to\n[4:13] basically say so many organizations have\n[4:15] like two to three years Terraform\n[4:17] footprint with like you know known\n[4:20] automation solutions such as Atlantis or\n[4:22] GitHub workflows that are all built\n[4:25] around Terraform you know security\n[4:27] scanners all built around Terraform IC\n[4:30] so it's very hard sell as a product\n[4:33] engineer who wants to build a product\n[4:35] and leverage\n[4:36] you know, a queue and a lambda and the\n[4:38] tool has to be connected and you don't\n[4:40] care how, right? And you do do\n[4:41] serverless. You're building this\n[4:43] beautiful API gateway with all of its\n[4:45] endpoints going through ECS Fargate\n[4:47] containers for long running jobs or\n[4:49] directly to lambdas for a quick response\n[4:51] and you don't care to learn about five\n[4:54] different Terraform modules with 40\n[4:55] different variable inputs and how do you\n[4:57] configure an API gateway, right? So for\n[4:59] serverless, you know, AWS CDK is\n[5:02] amazing, but you know, try to come to\n[5:05] your platform team and say, \"Yes, I know\n[5:07] you guys have this amazing Terraform uh\n[5:09] pull request previews and and and\n[5:11] scanning code and and and all this\n[5:13] stuff, but I want to use AWS CDK. I want\n[5:16] and then they have to start supporting\n[5:17] cloud for uh or even you know more go\n[5:20] towards them and say I want to adopt\n[5:22] pulley and now they have to think about\n[5:23] pulley um into this pipeline. Although\n[5:27] that pulley's strong point is that they\n[5:28] make um trans migration from Terraformed\n[5:32] to their cloud very easy. Obviously they\n[5:34] are backed by the original Terraform\n[5:36] providers. So they have a lot of\n[5:37] migration paths.\n[5:39] >> Yeah. I'm just looking at Palumi now.\n[5:40] They seem to support every language\n[5:42] under the sun\n[5:44] >> even YAML. Yeah, you can even put YAML\n[5:46] as an input and you get uh you get\n[5:48] infrastructure as code.\n[5:50] >> So do they do they have tools to to\n[5:51] convert the Terraform into into\n[5:53] >> language? They have a very powerful I\n[5:55] think they can even interact with the\n[5:57] terraform back end directly right so you\n[5:59] can have them side by side you don't\n[6:00] need to migrate everything immediately\n[6:02] the only problem is you have to now sign\n[6:04] a contract with Palumi and then you have\n[6:05] to you know\n[6:06] >> so you're so the big problem with Palumi\n[6:09] is that it's a commercial non-free thing\n[6:12] right\n[6:13] >> well when when the BSL announcement came\n[6:16] basically when Hashi Corp announced that\n[6:18] the source code was uh available but not\n[6:22] allowed to be used in competing compar\n[6:24] commercial platforms,\n[6:25] >> the business license that they put on\n[6:27] Terraform. Pulumi made a big\n[6:29] announcement how they are the real free\n[6:32] version, the real open-source\n[6:34] infrastructure as code. So, I can't\n[6:37] claim um\n[6:38] >> Oh, so so they're open. Okay, hold on. I\n[6:40] got to check out the GitHub now.\n[6:43] They're open source.\n[6:45] >> Yeah. And they um they also another\n[6:49] famous pro for Palumi is that SST which\n[6:53] is a I think originally SST they are the\n[6:56] people that build serverless.tf TF uh\n[6:58] serverless not serless.com.\n[7:02] >> Yeah. SD, right?\n[7:04] >> Yeah. Okay. So, so the source code is\n[7:07] Apache 2 licensed. Okay. Okay.\n[7:09] >> Yeah. So,\n[7:10] >> but I'm guessing they have have a model\n[7:12] because I see they see looks like they\n[7:14] have like a a cloud UI, right?\n[7:16] >> Yeah. So, they're they're like Terraform\n[7:18] Cloud, right? They they give you the\n[7:20] ability to very quickly get started.\n[7:21] Just sign up to their cloud and get your\n[7:24] Pulumi code ready. And the terraform\n[7:25] cloud is is essentially non-free, right?\n[7:28] >> Yeah. They both under management pricing\n[7:32] models, right? I think we talked about\n[7:34] that\n[7:35] >> very first time back in September when\n[7:36] there was this uh announcement of open.\n[7:39] >> Okay. So, Palumi seems to be in a good\n[7:42] position to deal with the CDKTF fallout\n[7:44] then, right?\n[7:46] >> Yeah. And they even have made their AWS\n[7:48] CDK adapter generally available. So\n[7:51] CDKTF had this in in um technical\n[7:54] preview since its inception and for five\n[7:57] years it was still in technical preview\n[7:59] until it got uh you know shut down\n[8:01] together with CDKTF. So the the adapter\n[8:04] basically your team can write AWS CDK\n[8:06] code and the adapter converts the the\n[8:08] generating cloud formation into pulley\n[8:10] equivalents allows your teams to quickly\n[8:13] convert your AWS CDK to pulley as well.\n[8:16] still that doesn't sound quite right to\n[8:19] me because even if you convert your\n[8:21] cloud information to Palumi, how the\n[8:22] hell are you going to, you know?\n[8:24] >> Yeah, it's I think this is just a um\n[8:28] >> marketing\n[8:29] >> just marketing and just to allow people\n[8:31] to quickly do a PC on Palumi and then\n[8:34] see the benefits of the cloud. I guess\n[8:36] there is a benefit compared to cloud\n[8:37] formation, right? It's very frustrating\n[8:40] cloud formation sometimes when you kick\n[8:41] off a roll out and then it gets stuck\n[8:43] and it does a roll back and you have to\n[8:44] wait an hour and and it's it's this\n[8:47] cloud for all or nothing behavior that\n[8:49] is sometimes very frustrating the\n[8:51] ability for cloud form to you know lose\n[8:54] track of resources if the logical ID\n[8:56] changes. So that's where like terraform\n[8:58] and puli are like advantage have\n[9:01] advantages because of the the way they\n[9:03] track state. They allow you to more\n[9:06] carefully refactor your state, but they\n[9:08] don't have this all or nothing guarantee\n[9:10] like cloud form, right? Cloud formation\n[9:12] is really like a database transaction.\n[9:13] You kick off a roll out, it's going to\n[9:15] go through. If it doesn't, it's going to\n[9:16] try and roll back, which honestly also\n[9:18] doesn't always work, right? Sometimes\n[9:20] there will be something blocking it.\n[9:22] Yeah. And then the roll back fails. So\n[9:24] that's where people are like, oh, the\n[9:25] AWS CDK is awesome. Cloud formation is\n[9:27] horrible. um and then they maybe have a\n[9:30] lot of issues with like managing the\n[9:33] overall teams\n[9:34] >> um interaction with cloud form stack. So\n[9:36] pulley is in a really great position.\n[9:38] They also have SSD.\n[9:40] >> So SSD originally serless were built on\n[9:42] cloud form and SAML um SAM sorry not\n[9:45] SAML uh SAM the\n[9:47] >> yeah I'm I'm an AWS SAM guy kind of guy\n[9:49] to be honest.\n[9:50] >> Yeah and SST was kind of like\n[9:51] replicating SAM on top of AWS CDK. So\n[9:54] you don't have to work with the AWS CDK\n[9:56] abstractions but for example you can say\n[9:58] I want open next deployed as serverless\n[10:00] on top of lambdas. So SST gave you that\n[10:03] um it take care of everything like I\n[10:05] want an application right I don't care\n[10:07] about lambdas\n[10:08] >> I'm just clicking around Palumi I guess\n[10:11] looks like it's done a quite a good job\n[10:13] I'd say on the face of it\n[10:15] >> it's just it's just the ball breaker is\n[10:18] the fact that they will\n[10:21] catch you in their in their web of the\n[10:24] the\n[10:24] >> cloud costs\n[10:25] >> the cloud costs\n[10:27] >> so there's there's no there's no open\n[10:29] source\n[10:30] >> there is cloud so\n[10:31] There was one of the uh misconceptions I\n[10:34] had as well about Pulumi was that I\n[10:36] heard that it was expensive and you\n[10:38] can't self-host but you can you can move\n[10:40] your cloud hosted back end to an S3\n[10:43] bucket but the the the counter to that\n[10:46] is then but now you have to manage all\n[10:48] of this cross team uh rolebased access\n[10:50] control you know all the enterprise\n[10:52] features that come around\n[10:54] >> oh yeah software\n[10:55] >> orchestration and all that sort of\n[10:56] stuff.\n[10:57] >> So so then you need to take that on\n[10:59] yourself. Yeah. And and in that aspect\n[11:01] in in the Terraform ecosystem, you have\n[11:03] a lot of open source projects, right?\n[11:05] And you can choose between um Spacelift\n[11:08] um you can choose between Terra Team or\n[11:12] um you you can choose Terra Mate or\n[11:14] Terra Grand or Terra Grand Scale. So\n[11:16] there's so many options around Terraform\n[11:18] and for Purimi we didn't have that many.\n[11:20] However, Spacelift and others say yes,\n[11:22] you can also manage pulley with us.\n[11:24] We're also hosting an S3 bucket and\n[11:27] we're coupling it together with your\n[11:28] terraform. So, so yeah, that's that's\n[11:31] why most of the reactions Yeah.\n[11:33] >> So, the\n[11:35] let me I'm I'm just\n[11:38] let me just share my screen. I was I\n[11:39] just I just want to map out where\n[11:42] infrastructure is at then.\n[11:44] Sorry.\n[11:50] And then we haven't even talked about um\n[11:53] system initiative and uh and\n[11:57] >> I hope I hope to catch up with um with\n[11:59] Adam at the config management camp in\n[12:01] Gent.\n[12:03] >> Yeah, you give you a beautiful demo.\n[12:06] >> Let me just trying to think.\n[12:09] I don't know how to do the scale here,\n[12:10] but I was I was going to put like maybe\n[12:13] this terraform here\n[12:18] and then this Palumi here\n[12:21] and Palumi has seems to be the last.\n[12:23] >> I would put AWS CDK all the way on the\n[12:25] right. That is like the benchmark for me\n[12:29] >> because it came first.\n[12:31] M no I don't think I think Palumi came\n[12:34] be around the same time or at the same\n[12:36] time or little bit earlier to AWS CDK\n[12:39] maybe\n[12:40] >> okay that okay so we have to pre prefix\n[12:43] this with AWS infrastructure\n[12:46] >> and then I mean I was going to put it\n[12:48] here but like anyway\n[12:50] so most\n[12:51] >> yeah for me it goes more to the right to\n[12:54] puli because because it it has this\n[12:57] little additional library like next to\n[13:00] AWS CDK Here you can put SST because\n[13:03] that is on top of poly\n[13:06] >> SST.\n[13:07] >> Yeah.\n[13:09] >> Okay. So I was going to maybe put use a\n[13:12] scale of like I don't know features\n[13:15] because you I mean let's be we've talked\n[13:17] about this before but you can't do\n[13:20] uh well lambda and serless very easily\n[13:23] on the terraform level.\n[13:26] So you need something like\n[13:28] >> it depends what features you're talking\n[13:29] about because features are related to\n[13:32] developer experience or operational\n[13:34] experience um and and how you like do\n[13:38] >> um previews plan previews and things\n[13:41] like that.\n[13:41] >> Well\n[13:44] and rolebased access control.\n[13:47] >> Um I'm thinking developer experience. I\n[13:49] mean what do you mean operational\n[13:50] experience like how easy it is to to\n[13:52] manage or\n[13:53] >> to refactor? uh for example let's say as\n[13:56] a company we start with a single\n[13:58] offering and we build a VPC with like\n[14:01] some lambdas and so on and then later on\n[14:03] we spin off\n[14:05] >> I would always feature agility\n[14:08] operational then\n[14:09] >> yeah agility\n[14:12] >> yeah so so\n[14:14] >> so you're you're only looking at one\n[14:17] dimension operational features\n[14:19] >> yeah well I I sent you the link but I\n[14:22] mean be good to explore\n[14:24] the dimensions.\n[14:25] >> I uh yeah, let me try and add the\n[14:28] developer experience dimension.\n[14:30] >> So, um\n[14:32] >> just bossing you around.\n[14:33] >> I mean, cloud form is probably at the\n[14:35] bloody bottom, isn't it? I mean, it's a\n[14:36] nightmare to work with.\n[14:39] >> No,\n[14:39] >> cloudformation is at the same level as\n[14:41] Terraform. Come on, be honest.\n[14:43] >> Going to give you that.\n[14:46] I've refacted Terraform plenty of time.\n[14:49] >> Okay.\n[14:49] >> The tooling is good. cloudformation like\n[14:52] you it's you.\n[14:53] >> So we I'm going to create a separate\n[14:55] scale for developer experience.\n[15:00] >> Yeah.\n[15:01] >> Oh wow. Hyperland does not\n[15:03] >> I'm going to I'm going to put AWS SAM in\n[15:05] the middle just because\n[15:08] >> I'm on Arch by the way. I'm going to say\n[15:11] like six times during this call.\n[15:14] Do you know I started I started my\n[15:16] channel by making Archix installed\n[15:18] videos for noobs like you.\n[15:21] >> No, I didn't have to install it.\n[15:25] >> Oh, yeah. You're using Omar. You're\n[15:27] using uh what's it called?\n[15:29] >> Omari.\n[15:30] >> Omari.\n[15:32] >> Yeah, that's that's how way he pronounce\n[15:33] it, right?\n[15:34] >> Yeah. But you were sending me\n[15:36] screenshots of Hyperland crashing or\n[15:38] something, right?\n[15:40] >> Yeah.\n[15:41] >> That's why I'm on Arch.\n[15:44] for the uh crash experiences. I think\n[15:48] Arch cannot run this website. Uh cannot\n[15:50] run um Xcoly draw.\n[15:54] >> What?\n[16:00] >> Maybe developer experience goes the\n[16:01] other way or I think the same direction.\n[16:04] >> What's okay define developer experience.\n[16:09] >> Yeah, as a DevOps engineer you should\n[16:11] know this.\n[16:14] >> Well,\n[16:14] >> okay.\n[16:16] Basically we are not devops engineer we\n[16:18] are platform engineers and one of the\n[16:20] things that we should focus on is to\n[16:22] provide our developers the tools so that\n[16:24] they can take ownership on the services\n[16:26] that they built and run in production.\n[16:28] >> Okay. Okay.\n[16:28] >> And the developer experience comes with\n[16:31] um you know the the easiness at which\n[16:34] they can define their production\n[16:36] workloads.\n[16:37] >> Yeah. So my my points of what my point\n[16:40] of mental reference is like you know net\n[16:43] lefi and u up cell and things like that.\n[16:48] >> So essentially what what they need to\n[16:51] twiddle with is is a config yaml and uh\n[16:54] a CLI tool or something like that and\n[16:56] that that's it right that that's that's\n[16:59] my point of reference. Of course, so\n[17:02] many companies just do it so much more\n[17:06] convolutely convolut in a awkward way.\n[17:13] Fly.io.\n[17:15] >> What did you say you you you called\n[17:17] >> Netlfi? Netlfi.\n[17:21] >> Yeah. So, they all work in a similar\n[17:23] way. There's some CLI and there's some\n[17:26] config YAML\n[17:28] >> or toml.\n[17:31] Maybe I should do a scale for cost\n[17:35] like or enterprise adoption or something\n[17:37] like that\n[17:41] because some of these things like Palumi\n[17:43] is going to get expensive.\n[17:45] Enterprise\n[17:51] I don't know. So, anything I select\n[17:53] doesn't show up on my on my browser. I\n[17:55] think there's a problem with Chromium to\n[17:57] be honest. Um, I'm on a Chromium browser\n[18:00] >> on a fork\n[18:02] >> and uh and doesn't render properly\n[18:04] sometimes.\n[18:05] >> So, Palumi is going to be expensive. I\n[18:07] think cloudformation terraform is a bit\n[18:09] tricky cuz\n[18:12] No, I mean Terraform is good because you\n[18:14] don't need to pay for rum.\n[18:19] No rum.\n[18:21] I think you cannot put operational\n[18:23] features AWS\n[18:25] above terraform\n[18:27] or maybe\n[18:29] >> I I mean I love it. I love it\n[18:31] >> because it's backed by CFN. So you must\n[18:33] have the same problems like losing\n[18:35] logical um logical ID for resources\n[18:39] loses the actual resource ownership.\n[18:41] Although they have added a lot of new\n[18:43] features to cloud form to help you\n[18:45] refactor your code. But yeah, the main\n[18:47] reason there is that organizations\n[18:49] constantly change the names. Oh, we did\n[18:51] a we we had um an offsite of the with\n[18:54] the sea level team and we decided to\n[18:55] merge our AI team with our data team and\n[18:58] then all of these resources that were AI\n[19:00] team.\n[19:01] >> I love what you I love what you said uh\n[19:03] a few chats ago with changing of IDs.\n[19:08] You were saying that like uh you should\n[19:10] just use labels, right, to address\n[19:12] resources\n[19:14] >> and not and use opaque IDs. I mean I\n[19:17] really that stuck with me. I need to do\n[19:19] that more.\n[19:21] >> Yeah, I think so.\n[19:22] >> Oh, and convince people you don't have\n[19:23] to name a bloody bucket this certain\n[19:25] way.\n[19:26] >> And that's something that cloud form\n[19:28] kind of forces upon you or AWS CDK,\n[19:30] right? By default, it doesn't even allow\n[19:32] you to define the physical ID of\n[19:33] resources. And it and then I had some\n[19:36] some um colleagues and they were like,\n[19:37] \"No, no, this load balancer has to be\n[19:39] named exactly like this because I need\n[19:40] to be able to find it in the console.\"\n[19:42] And I'm like, \"No,\n[19:43] >> no,\n[19:44] >> no.\n[19:46] then you have to deploy the same stack\n[19:48] twice and you you get an error because\n[19:49] the load balancer identity like physical\n[19:52] ID does already exist like\n[19:55] >> you know and then I got this whole\n[19:57] discussion with the team manager after\n[20:00] the guy that tried to do what I I\n[20:03] wouldn't allow him to do raised it up to\n[20:06] our our manager and then said yeah come\n[20:08] on Vincent we we're not deploying the\n[20:11] same application twice in the same AWS\n[20:13] account and it's like Well, yes, we are.\n[20:16] And we are consolidating more of our\n[20:18] infrastructure. So,\n[20:18] >> okay. I mean, I think you're being a\n[20:20] little bit danty. I mean, to be honest,\n[20:22] I make assumptions right now. The thing\n[20:25] I'm working with and I need to make it\n[20:27] uh talk to each other at some point\n[20:31] soon. Okay. So,\n[20:34] um yeah. Uh well, I thought I mean I\n[20:39] like to fill this void. I do think AWS\n[20:41] Okay. AWS is so specific to serless,\n[20:44] it's probably not worth beating around\n[20:46] about.\n[20:48] Uh\n[20:53] I'm probably going to copy.\n[20:56] This is so difficult because the\n[20:58] functionality is not comparable, is it?\n[21:01] >> Copy it or just drag it.\n[21:02] >> Oh, sorry. I meant to copy it. Hold on.\n[21:04] Let me copy my\n[21:07] Okay. I don't know. We've just been\n[21:09] dragging things around. Maybe we should\n[21:11] we got to start somewhere. Let's\n[21:13] >> say what we what we mean by this.\n[21:16] >> Okay. Your developer experience.\n[21:19] Um I'm I'm really surprised you put\n[21:21] Terraform right rock bottom. I mean\n[21:22] Terraform has an incredible developer\n[21:24] experience.\n[21:25] >> No,\n[21:27] >> it does.\n[21:28] >> It's a horrible developer experience.\n[21:31] >> It's the worst.\n[21:32] >> Okay. So, okay. I I think Okay, you're\n[21:35] coming from a developer point of view.\n[21:37] Okay. You're like the guy says like I\n[21:39] don't understand this. What is this TF\n[21:41] file?\n[21:42] >> Why do you s make a whiny voice when\n[21:44] you're the emulator developer a product\n[21:45] engineer?\n[21:47] >> What I'm saying is Terraform um is\n[21:51] exposing every single API resource of\n[21:54] the cloud of the SAS that you're\n[21:57] interacting with, right? Either the\n[21:58] cloud provider or um you know whatever\n[22:02] um is it or whatever you're you're\n[22:04] you're talking to. Every single API\n[22:08] endpoint must be configured and then\n[22:10] must be linked together. So if you're\n[22:12] setting up an API gateway and a lambda,\n[22:14] you must set up the IM role and the IM\n[22:17] policy to you know provide lambda\n[22:19] permissions. Then you have to do you\n[22:21] know the lambda trust policy. Then you\n[22:22] have to set up lambda permissions to\n[22:24] allow the gate API gateway service to\n[22:27] invoke the lambda that you have to do\n[22:29] with terapform.\n[22:30] >> Yeah. And then you have to do it for\n[22:32] every possible scenario that those\n[22:34] things can be combined together, right?\n[22:38] >> Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I I'm just trying\n[22:40] I'm just trying to come up with the\n[22:41] right word. You have to basically\n[22:44] >> manage everything and it's\n[22:45] >> Yeah. As a developer and many people\n[22:47] always came to me when I was purely\n[22:49] Terraform only guy um and said like look\n[22:52] I'm not like you. I cannot read the API\n[22:56] docs or the provider docs and figure out\n[22:58] how I need to comm connect connect all\n[23:00] of these resources. Let me click ops.\n[23:02] Let me go into the AWS console, click on\n[23:04] this, then click on that and then after\n[23:06] that I will try to capture everything.\n[23:09] >> On the subject of click ops, is there\n[23:14] good support by any of these tools to\n[23:16] basically capture the state from from a\n[23:18] from AWS? I think I think you should ask\n[23:21] uh system initiative to give you that de\n[23:23] demo because that's one of the things\n[23:25] that he's advertising right like look\n[23:27] people have clicked and now you have to\n[23:29] you know control it so here you go\n[23:31] system initiative doing that for you is\n[23:33] there anything that does that really\n[23:34] nicely\n[23:35] >> I don't think so I don't think any of\n[23:37] these tools help you fix whatever\n[23:40] somebody clicked in clicks up still in\n[23:43] but\n[23:44] >> some of these tools allow you to avoid\n[23:46] clickups to basically start the correct\n[23:50] way um by defining it with SSD because\n[23:53] they give you that ability to say like I\n[23:55] had a gateway.\n[23:56] >> I mean I I got a soft spot for click ops\n[23:58] in a way just because I was on a\n[24:01] >> I was on a job and it took it took me\n[24:03] literally like a week just just to\n[24:05] toggle something. Wow. I'm I'm\n[24:07] exaggerating, but it took a while.\n[24:11] >> And I thought to myself,\n[24:14] >> yeah, absolutely. So that's the problem\n[24:16] with a lot of these infrastructure as\n[24:18] code libraries is that they're built\n[24:19] from um a very low-level perspective and\n[24:23] you can either and a lot of the tools\n[24:26] that are being built right now is to you\n[24:30] know reflect the reality of this\n[24:33] nature of the cloud changing things\n[24:36] under the hood right if you create an\n[24:38] RDS instance it's going to auto upgrade\n[24:39] to the latest Postgress version and then\n[24:41] your Terraform's going to go like nope\n[24:43] this is supposed to be Postgress 15.\n[24:45] What are you doing running Postgress 18\n[24:47] over there? You know, let's delete this\n[24:49] database and recreate it.\n[24:51] >> Yeah, actually\n[24:53] >> dealing with dealing with data and any\n[24:55] of these tools makes me a bit sweaty\n[24:59] >> like uh\n[25:01] what happened.\n[25:03] >> That's interesting because that's\n[25:05] exactly the argument that somebody made\n[25:07] just now on a thread on Reddit because\n[25:09] I'm I'm 24 hours on Reddit obviously. um\n[25:12] that\n[25:14] he just made the argument that the only\n[25:16] place you would use something like\n[25:17] Terraform is to manage databases.\n[25:19] >> What?\n[25:20] >> Yeah. Because he says like everything\n[25:22] else is so dynamic and most of the stuff\n[25:24] you shouldn't be doing with IC. IC\n[25:27] should be done for these like um\n[25:30] resources that take need additional like\n[25:33] operational\n[25:34] >> Okay, maybe he's got a point because\n[25:35] it's got it's got more\n[25:38] >> control\n[25:39] >> stability aspects to it. Yeah. Yeah,\n[25:42] because you're right. You do a because\n[25:44] with IC it's often very close to\n[25:46] GitHubs, right? You need to make a\n[25:48] source code change,\n[25:50] >> bring it to production.\n[25:51] >> We're using Terraform to manage some\n[25:52] data right now and and uh our basically\n[25:56] one of our main guard rails is the plan,\n[26:00] but no one reads the plan. No one reads\n[26:03] the plan. Like we like we got like a\n[26:06] nice GitHub summary to say like, oh, do\n[26:09] you know you're recreating resources\n[26:10] here?\n[26:13] and they just go, \"Yeah, whatever.\n[26:15] Apply.\"\n[26:16] >> That's weird because like first off, why\n[26:19] is it recreating resources? That means\n[26:21] that and that's the hard thing about\n[26:22] Terraform.\n[26:23] >> Well, I I didn't want to mention the I\n[26:25] didn't want to mention the provider, but\n[26:27] I'm I'm going to mention it. It's not\n[26:29] going to incriminate anyone, but this\n[26:31] the we've been working with the snow\n[26:33] snowflake provider and it just wants to\n[26:36] recreate things very easily, but it it's\n[26:38] it's it's a complicated environment to\n[26:41] be honest.\n[26:42] >> Yeah. Some providers have really low\n[26:44] quality.\n[26:45] >> Yeah. And the snowflake one is in\n[26:50] maybe someone has made a video about it,\n[26:52] but it's it's it's came out of like I it\n[26:56] came out of like the uh the Chan\n[26:58] Zuckerberg Foundation or something like\n[27:00] this. It's hasn't been maintained very\n[27:02] well. Then Snowflake itself eventually\n[27:05] adopted it.\n[27:07] >> LOL. Oh, that's so funny. I I I used and\n[27:09] there's so many experimental features in\n[27:11] it, it makes you very nervous. I mean,\n[27:14] and then Snowflake is only used by the\n[27:15] like the biggest enterprises ever.\n[27:19] >> Wow.\n[27:20] >> We It's a very It's a very weird setup,\n[27:24] but I guess it is it is better than\n[27:26] managing it by by hand, I like to think.\n[27:29] But still at the end of the day the the\n[27:31] provider just seems to do SQL calls or\n[27:33] or like it it it lacks so much\n[27:35] functionality you're ending up having to\n[27:37] write these like what do you call like\n[27:39] SQL execute blocks here and there and\n[27:41] everywhere which\n[27:43] >> yeah so so this is kind of where I feel\n[27:47] when I started on my Terraform journey I\n[27:49] was like terraform everything right you\n[27:52] create an RDS instance you need a\n[27:53] database in it well we're going to\n[27:55] define the terraform provider for\n[27:58] Postgress and we're going to connect it\n[28:00] to your RDS instance and we're going to\n[28:02] create a database and we're going to\n[28:03] create the plug the extensions that need\n[28:05] to be active on that database and it's a\n[28:07] nightmare because now when you ever you\n[28:09] run Terraform you have to have a tunnel\n[28:11] to connect to the Postgress instance and\n[28:12] you know once you start doing compliance\n[28:14] you need you need all types of security\n[28:16] around that and and this is the type of\n[28:19] stuff that it shouldn't be part of\n[28:21] Terraform right like running SQL queries\n[28:24] through a provider just to me already\n[28:26] after using it for 10 years seems\n[28:28] something like done that been there\n[28:30] never again you know\n[28:31] >> yeah okay I think we all agree I agreed\n[28:36] I'm agreed with this whole developer\n[28:38] experience at the bottom here um\n[28:40] >> convinced you\n[28:41] >> but but at the same time the things that\n[28:43] we put at the very top don't really I\n[28:46] mean that's for very narrow use cases I\n[28:49] feel like we need to have maybe two axis\n[28:53] at this point because we we need\n[28:56] we We need like oh god\n[29:00] one access to sort of\n[29:05] we need we need the vertical access to\n[29:07] talk about um what you can do like you\n[29:10] know AWS\n[29:13] feature\n[29:15] >> but that's what the defex or what\n[29:16] >> scope or something like well like the\n[29:19] trouble is is that versal is good at\n[29:21] setting up a website but you can't like\n[29:25] run a database So I mean probably I mean\n[29:28] maybe it does support database\n[29:29] >> because is this as a higher level\n[29:30] abstraction right?\n[29:33] >> Yeah. So I understood. So so basically\n[29:36] it needs to go down\n[29:38] you know it needs to sink down here.\n[29:40] Well well with with\n[29:42] >> you just moved you just moved my devx uh\n[29:45] scale to the right saying feature scope\n[29:48] and and you just\n[29:50] >> and then here I would say de dev\n[29:52] experience because we need to basic okay\n[29:55] we can discuss this later. I think your\n[29:56] feature scope is the devx and your your\n[29:59] x-axis should be the operational\n[30:01] features that we we were just talking\n[30:03] about\n[30:04] >> because because the feature scope here\n[30:05] like Versel has um great Devx so it\n[30:09] needs to go up there but horrible\n[30:11] operational experience such as like I\n[30:13] need fine grain control to bootstrap a\n[30:15] database I can't do that because first\n[30:17] is very high level and under the hood\n[30:19] it's going to create some type of data\n[30:21] store and they take care of it which is\n[30:23] like a trade-off right\n[30:25] >> yeah they're going to you like three\n[30:26] different types of data store and you\n[30:27] don't care how they're\n[30:29] >> Yeah, you're right. You're right. The\n[30:30] operational stuff comes. Yeah. Yeah.\n[30:32] You're right. You're right. You're\n[30:33] right. I didn't know what SST v2 is.\n[30:36] What the hell is that? That's just\n[30:37] serverless, isn't it?\n[30:39] >> So, basically the the way I understand\n[30:41] it cuz I only came became familiar with\n[30:44] SSD when my my friend introduced it to\n[30:46] me. Um originally I think the server the\n[30:49] people that built serverless.com\n[30:52] they created um SSD on top of AWS CDK. I\n[30:56] think serverless was using SAM and maybe\n[30:59] cloud form directly and then they with\n[31:01] some scripting around it and then they\n[31:03] created um SST which is just instead of\n[31:07] directly writing cloud form they would\n[31:09] just leverage all of AWS CDK because AWS\n[31:11] CDK is this amazing library that gives\n[31:14] you these beautiful integration\n[31:15] patterns. If you need to create a lambda\n[31:17] and a gateway and you just connect it to\n[31:19] it's going to take care of everything,\n[31:20] right? So you don't have to generate\n[31:21] every single cloud for resource, you\n[31:23] just say here.\n[31:23] >> So it's like a it's another sort of\n[31:26] CDK/palumi\n[31:27] type type offering, right?\n[31:30] >> No, it's it's on top of so originally it\n[31:32] was on top of cloud for then they\n[31:34] rewrote it on top of um on on on AWS CDK\n[31:39] and then they rewrote it on top of FUMI.\n[31:41] So SSD is like the AWS CDKL2s. Um but\n[31:45] they're trying to go like like Versel\n[31:48] kind of in the middle.\n[31:50] >> They are.\n[31:50] >> Oh, we don't have Palumi on this top\n[31:52] thing. I mean Palumi needs to be up here\n[31:56] or something. I don't know.\n[31:57] >> You're you're like yeah I was trying to\n[32:00] duplicate it but it didn't manage to\n[32:02] duplicate it. So yeah, Palumi and SST on\n[32:05] operational I think there would be the\n[32:07] same.\n[32:10] Okay.\n[32:11] >> Yeah, SSTV1 was on AWS CDK and SSTV2 is\n[32:15] on top of Pulumi. Um, so\n[32:17] >> how do you get exposure to all this\n[32:19] stuff, man? I feel like I'm doing a lot\n[32:21] and I don't get to touch some things.\n[32:24] Okay. I guess you attend a lot of talks,\n[32:27] don't you?\n[32:29] It was my colleague uh sorry my ex-\n[32:31] flatmate who um who who pivoted you know\n[32:34] originally started with Amplify then\n[32:36] with AWS CDK and then he says you know\n[32:37] SSD is this amazing thing.\n[32:38] >> Oh my god. Amplify. Oh my god. Sweet\n[32:41] Jesus.\n[32:41] >> Yeah. But Amplify also completely wrote\n[32:44] itself on top of AWS CDK. Yeah. And then\n[32:46] they just became like uh this portal\n[32:48] that you it's kind of like I think AWS\n[32:50] answer to Versel. This basically like\n[32:53] allows you to create your front end to\n[32:55] deploy it.\n[32:56] >> Yeah. That's true. That's true. But I I\n[32:58] never appreciated the stack.\n[33:01] >> Okay.\n[33:01] >> Yeah, they completely changed the stack\n[33:03] because originally amplify was doing\n[33:04] cloud formation and now it's just doing\n[33:07] like CDK stacks and then it's just\n[33:10] allowing you to manage your front-end\n[33:11] deployments, you know, your S3 contents\n[33:13] and your CDN configuration from an\n[33:16] abstract level. A bit like Versel really\n[33:18] like I think amplify is really like\n[33:20] Versell.\n[33:21] >> No, I think I think Vel is much better\n[33:23] than amplify.\n[33:25] >> When was the last time you looked at\n[33:26] amplify? uh years ago and I I had I\n[33:29] think I think I have a GitHub project\n[33:32] about it and then it was impossible to\n[33:34] like just maintain it. So basically,\n[33:38] >> yes, I know that's what amplify used to\n[33:41] be. But what I there was this uh lady\n[33:44] who posted on LinkedIn access to a Udemi\n[33:46] workshop that she had just published\n[33:48] which was AWS AWS CDK and Amplify. And I\n[33:52] and for free you got access for like two\n[33:54] days or something like that. And so I I\n[33:55] did a speedrun through it like literally\n[33:57] in a day just crushed it. And um I went\n[34:00] through the whole AWS CDK thing and the\n[34:02] Amplify side of things. And this\n[34:04] literally just like a month ago, not two\n[34:06] months ago.\n[34:07] >> Yeah. And and it's really like amplify\n[34:09] when I looked at it and I haven't used\n[34:11] forcell but um it really is like oh I\n[34:14] want to do blue green experiment. Oh I\n[34:16] want to do this. It just takes care of\n[34:17] everything under the hood for you and\n[34:19] you you just go here's my website source\n[34:21] code and it just take care of the whole\n[34:23] >> anyway. So we can put bloody amplify\n[34:26] here. Gez.\n[34:28] >> Yeah. Amplify V2 or whatever. Amplify\n[34:30] current\n[34:34] whatever\n[34:37] new one. Okay.\n[34:39] So,\n[34:41] okay. So, now now if we\n[34:44] and how do we account for the the cost\n[34:46] of things? I guess let's let's just\n[34:49] focus on operational features and and\n[34:51] DevX. Can are you able to copy and paste\n[34:54] into this one so that we have a a better\n[34:58] graph here? or shall I just do it?\n[35:02] >> Uh, yeah. No, my my my Chromium is un\n[35:05] unresponsive.\n[35:06] >> Okay, so if I maybe I put Terraform on\n[35:08] the bottom here.\n[35:11] Cloudformation too. God, it's got a\n[35:14] terrible experience.\n[35:17] Palumi\n[35:19] looks like it can do a lot.\n[35:22] Wait, it's going to look the same, isn't\n[35:24] it?\n[35:25] It's going to look the same. There's no\n[35:27] there's no DevX and operational features\n[35:32] seems to be the same thing, right?\n[35:35] >> I mean, Palumi and Palumi cloud I guess\n[35:37] and Terraform and Terraform cloud maybe.\n[35:40] Uh\n[35:42] so Palumi I would I would pose in terms\n[35:45] of operational features a bit higher\n[35:48] than Terraform and in terms of DevOps\n[35:50] kind of in the middle. Um but but\n[35:54] ultimately I can't help but think\n[35:56] there's no the major differentiator\n[35:59] short is going to be is just going to be\n[36:01] it's just going to be price isn't it? We\n[36:04] you you like if you were like a an enter\n[36:07] like a Fortune 500 company,\n[36:11] you're not going to use um\n[36:16] well, you can't you can't use VEL and\n[36:18] and things cuz that's not going to be\n[36:20] enough\n[36:23] and\n[36:24] you're not going to use AW CDK and\n[36:26] Terraform is as we know limited.\n[36:32] But then you're gonna you're gonna\n[36:33] basically pay for Palumi. Okay, this I'm\n[36:35] not too sure where I'm going with this.\n[36:37] >> Okay, I\n[36:38] >> I also wanted to tie this into AI\n[36:40] somehow, but it just it look it looks\n[36:42] like Palumi is in a very good spot. And\n[36:45] we haven't even talk about we haven't\n[36:46] even talked about Kubernetes, but I\n[36:48] don't want to talk about Kubernetes.\n[36:51] Looks like Palumi is is on a I don't\n[36:54] know if can can we invest in Palumi?\n[36:55] Looks like it's in a really good spot.\n[36:58] >> Are you building a tech radar? Maybe I\n[37:00] should pull up the some famous tech\n[37:02] radar.\n[37:05] Um, hold on. Uh, what was I? Ah, AWS\n[37:10] CDK.\n[37:13] >> Not on the current edition.\n[37:16] >> I would give AWS CDK highdevx but very\n[37:20] low operational experience. And then SST\n[37:24] given it's on on Palumi would be a\n[37:27] little bit less on the DevX side because\n[37:29] they don't they didn't build all the\n[37:31] same like service levels but on the same\n[37:33] level as Palumi in terms of operation\n[37:35] because it lose uses Palumi under the\n[37:37] hood. Yeah.\n[37:40] What else is there?\n[37:44] Does it make sense?\n[37:51] Where are you? I don't see you anymore.\n[37:53] >> I'm here. I'm here. I was just looking\n[37:56] at um Oh.\n[37:59] What the Why does it say data dog?\n[38:03] >> What the I\n[38:05] >> I was just I was just looking at the uh\n[38:10] >> I think you're on this\n[38:11] >> the tech radar.\n[38:15] The thing the only thing it says on\n[38:17] platform to adopt is uh ARM in the\n[38:20] cloud. which sounds a bit weird\n[38:26] sometimes. I wonder if these people that\n[38:28] make those T radars really know what\n[38:30] they're talking about.\n[38:34] I don't know where which one you're\n[38:35] looking at, but like I'm just guessing\n[38:40] now.\n[38:43] Uh,\n[38:46] okay. Let's tie this back to AI. So we\n[38:49] we just riffed about how\n[38:53] Palumi ST is is in a good spot. We we\n[38:57] Oh, we should we should put system\n[38:59] initiative somewhere here, right?\n[39:01] >> Maybe you can take this this slide back\n[39:04] when you talk to Adam from system\n[39:06] initiative where you put it.\n[39:08] >> I'm not that I'm not that happy here,\n[39:09] but like okay, what okay say you're the\n[39:14] what do you call it? the chief\n[39:15] technology officer of a of a big company\n[39:19] that that had a whole bunch of AWS\n[39:22] accounts\n[39:24] >> only AWS.\n[39:25] >> Let's say it's only AWS. Just just to\n[39:27] keep the conversation sane.\n[39:30] >> Yeah.\n[39:31] >> How would you begin to manage it? Like\n[39:33] let's even go even more bizarre. Let's\n[39:35] say like, oh Vincent, we need to build\n[39:39] up to 100 accounts and we need to do\n[39:41] this in the space of six months.\n[39:45] and or three months and you choose the\n[39:48] technology to do it with can I assume\n[39:51] that Vincent would choose Palumi\n[39:55] and there's no budget I mean\n[39:57] >> it would be between Palumi and or\n[39:59] between SST and AWS CDK yes if there's\n[40:02] no budget limitation\n[40:04] maybe more towards SST then\n[40:07] >> but SST doesn't have a a cloud and man\n[40:10] and governance and or\n[40:12] >> I think they may have runners but They\n[40:13] they basically\n[40:15] originally SSD they had their own like\n[40:18] deployment pipelines but since they\n[40:20] completely pinned themselves on pulley I\n[40:22] would imagine that they are completely\n[40:24] powered by Palumi deployments.\n[40:27] >> Okay it sounds like Palumi. So okay so\n[40:31] you would explain once once more why SST\n[40:34] and and and Palumi and AWS CDK and cloud\n[40:37] for what the relationship is right you\n[40:39] understand AWS CDK. So AWS CDK is to\n[40:42] cloud formation what SST is to pull. In\n[40:46] other words, Pulumi gives you the\n[40:48] low-level concept of an IM role, an IM\n[40:51] policy and a bucket and an API gateway\n[40:55] and a lambda. And then SST gives you the\n[40:58] concept of I have an um an API gateway\n[41:02] that's backed by a lambda and write\n[41:06] >> higher level patterns, right?\n[41:08] >> Yeah. SSD level two level threes and\n[41:11] >> yeah and then and then Puni they have\n[41:15] two different providers they have the\n[41:16] pure terraform provider converted on top\n[41:19] of their own engine so they they run the\n[41:21] engine the configuration that you\n[41:23] provide is in programming language or\n[41:25] YAML or whatever they they run that\n[41:27] inside a runtime they convert your\n[41:30] program into configuration that then\n[41:33] gets um executed right so if if you look\n[41:36] at it like cdktf I to me pum and CDKTF\n[41:39] is very similar um is that you write\n[41:42] TypeScript code or Golang code or Python\n[41:44] code and it generates configuration for\n[41:47] the Terraform provider and PUMI their\n[41:49] internal representation of whatever that\n[41:52] cloud plug-in is right if they targeting\n[41:54] AWS it's a plug-in for AWS this they\n[41:57] originally just ported the provider AW\n[42:00] for Terraform for AWS right PMI was just\n[42:03] porting the Terraform provider and then\n[42:05] building a programmatic interface on top\n[42:06] of it I think they may like refactored\n[42:09] the way that that works because now they\n[42:11] have all kinds of hooks system. So while\n[42:14] you are your program is executing some\n[42:16] of your program execution is happening\n[42:19] while it's deploying things inside the\n[42:21] cloud. So if you look at Terraform, you\n[42:23] you have a configuration and then the\n[42:25] provider is executing the configuration\n[42:27] and then the provider is you know config\n[42:29] like sending the request to the API do\n[42:31] this then send the request to the API do\n[42:33] this right and Terraform\n[42:36] does not really have a lot of features\n[42:38] that allows you to mit deployment\n[42:40] execute this function and then based on\n[42:42] the output do something else right by\n[42:45] design because originally Terraform was\n[42:47] meant to be very deterministic very\n[42:49] predict predictable so that you are able\n[42:52] to to know this is the exact\n[42:53] configuration what I want all of these\n[42:55] resources to look right right but with\n[42:57] pulley you have like this on on event\n[42:59] type of things um you can you can hook\n[43:02] into the process and if you're deploying\n[43:04] to a region that only has two\n[43:05] availability zones you automatically\n[43:07] like um adjust the configuration towards\n[43:10] it right so yeah so pulley has these\n[43:13] like events um and I think AWS CDK has\n[43:17] similar things because while you are you\n[43:19] know as as a as a product engineer\n[43:22] defining this is what I need to deploy.\n[43:24] It will also hook into the target\n[43:26] environment depending on how you are um\n[43:29] calling the the constructs. They can\n[43:31] basically decide that okay I I just I\n[43:34] just downloaded the whole VPC setup. I\n[43:36] know there's two subnetss and they are\n[43:38] into the these these availability zones.\n[43:40] I know all of this information which is\n[43:42] called the context of the environment\n[43:44] that you're deploying into and they can\n[43:46] reconfigure or generate cloud form\n[43:47] stacks accordingly.\n[43:48] >> I didn't even I've never written a CDK\n[43:50] like that. Um\n[43:51] >> yeah that's that's what context\n[43:52] providers do and and then to make sure\n[43:55] that still deterministic that context\n[43:57] that was used to basically determine how\n[44:00] the uh cloudformation stack is generated\n[44:02] is also stored on disk. So you can then\n[44:04] put that into your GitHub um into your\n[44:07] version control sorry git and then you\n[44:10] can um you know rerun the context lookup\n[44:12] to update your context. So then if you\n[44:14] want to change things for example maybe\n[44:16] maybe one day you are targeting\n[44:18] Singapore region and it only has two\n[44:19] availability zones uh but the next time\n[44:22] Singapore introduced the third\n[44:23] availability zone and you don't want all\n[44:25] of your cloudformation\n[44:26] >> you're blowing my mind here CDK you\n[44:29] would check in something into your in\n[44:31] >> the context yes so so\n[44:33] >> I've never seen that done I mean the CDK\n[44:36] is all managed in cloudformation\n[44:38] is how I understood it\n[44:40] >> CD no CDK generates cloudformation but\n[44:43] in the process of generating cloud form.\n[44:45] It can do some callouts to your\n[44:47] environment to determine how to best\n[44:49] generate the cloudformation.\n[44:50] >> Do you have an example of a context\n[44:52] checked into Git? I guess it's all going\n[44:54] to be\n[44:54] >> Yeah, the one that I I was just talking\n[44:56] about and the example that they give why\n[44:58] you should checking your context is\n[45:00] exactly what I just said like let's say\n[45:02] that the new availability zone is\n[45:03] introduced and that kind of like deter\n[45:08] subnetting logic that you have a whole\n[45:10] like subnet for this particular tier of\n[45:13] of of your\n[45:14] >> blowing my mind. I didn't really know\n[45:15] about this context. I have I have to\n[45:17] look it up. And then and then and then\n[45:19] when you do CDK bootstrap it it creates\n[45:21] like three different bloody places for\n[45:24] things or something if I remember\n[45:25] correctly.\n[45:25] >> Yes. because CDK is very enterprise\n[45:27] focused allowing you to exactly control\n[45:30] how to um you know how the the the\n[45:34] bootstrap happens right like what are\n[45:36] the basically CDK has this asset\n[45:39] bundling pipeline and that's why it\n[45:41] bootstraps so many things because if you\n[45:43] do terraform you just need to find a way\n[45:45] for example to put an object into a S3\n[45:47] bucket so that your lambda can point to\n[45:49] it and then deploy the source code from\n[45:51] the S3 object or maybe your lambda wants\n[45:52] to be deployed from a docker image so\n[45:54] you need to use ECR So these asset\n[45:56] repositories uh the ECR and the S3\n[45:59] bucket are very important in the way\n[46:00] that you deploy your code and this is\n[46:03] more important if you do serverless\n[46:04] because you know you have all of these\n[46:06] snippets of of of code that that need to\n[46:08] be coordinated together with your Lambda\n[46:10] um configuration and the environment\n[46:11] variables and everything right so AWS\n[46:13] CDK has a built-in asset pipeline and\n[46:16] and and part of the things that it\n[46:17] bootstrap is all of the necessary\n[46:19] supporting um architecture for that\n[46:21] asset pipeline it will create an ECR\n[46:23] repository so that it you know, so that\n[46:25] they can build a Docker image part of\n[46:27] the, you know, bundling aspect of your\n[46:29] of your application and then deploy that\n[46:32] that Docker image in or push that Docker\n[46:34] image into the um into ECR the asset\n[46:38] registry for Docker images or you know\n[46:41] push the bucket maybe which is an ES ES\n[46:45] build bundled NodeJS with all of its\n[46:47] dependencies and whatever AWS SDK is\n[46:49] external needs to be external because\n[46:51] that's provided within the runtime. So\n[46:53] all of that is taken care of by AWS CDK\n[46:55] because it has this beautiful asset\n[46:56] pipeline, right?\n[46:57] >> Well, I noticed it in one in my\n[47:00] workplace that when AWCDK deploys this\n[47:02] Fargate pattern or whatever, it's\n[47:05] building the Docker image in the same\n[47:07] pipeline. And I thought to myself,\n[47:10] >> yeah,\n[47:10] >> that's not cool.\n[47:12] >> It depends. So as soon as the Docker\n[47:16] file build fails with some rate limit,\n[47:19] then then the whole deployment fails.\n[47:21] That's a joke in my opinion.\n[47:23] >> Uh to be honest,\n[47:26] if you are coming from a developer\n[47:28] experience perspective, not being\n[47:30] bothered by how exactly your code gets\n[47:33] bundled up and and made available to be\n[47:36] deployed is kind of a feature that you\n[47:39] want and that's why they have it, right?\n[47:40] This asset pipeline thing. From looking\n[47:43] back when I started with AWS and\n[47:45] Terraform, I very strictly said, okay,\n[47:47] your code, for example, your website and\n[47:49] your bundle, the way that like assets\n[47:51] are getting deployed is very\n[47:52] disconnected from your infrastructure,\n[47:54] right? Classically,\n[47:55] >> I'm not so sure I'm a big believer that\n[47:57] because because these things,\n[47:58] >> it's wrong. What I just said is wrong.\n[48:00] When you start out, you think like I\n[48:03] have a very very strict separation\n[48:05] between infrastructure and the code\n[48:07] because my infrastructure is, for\n[48:09] example, my Kubernetes cluster. It's my\n[48:11] S3 bucket and my cloud cloudfront uh CDN\n[48:14] setup, but the actual website that's\n[48:16] managed by the product team that need to\n[48:18] be deployed and rebuilt is decoupled\n[48:20] from it. Right.\n[48:21] >> Exactly. Exactly.\n[48:22] >> Exactly. And that's wrong.\n[48:24] >> What? absolutely wrong because if you're\n[48:28] doing um actual DevOps culture two pizza\n[48:32] team where you have site reliability\n[48:33] engineer as part of the product team the\n[48:35] whole deployment process belongs to the\n[48:38] product team not to the infrastructure\n[48:40] team.\n[48:41] >> Yeah. Okay. Okay. But there's more to it\n[48:46] because you don't want a product team to\n[48:49] manage Kubernetes. But okay.\n[48:52] >> Why? I mean like sure you don't want\n[48:54] them to damage to manage Kubernetes.\n[48:55] That's where you as a platform team are\n[48:57] provisioning the the the Kubernetes and\n[48:59] the integration points like the\n[49:00] Kubernetes endpoint where they need to\n[49:02] target their deployments towards, right?\n[49:04] >> But we're not talking about Kubernetes\n[49:06] here, right? We were talking about an S3\n[49:07] bucket and the contents of that S3\n[49:09] bucket or a lambda and the contents of\n[49:12] that lambda together with like let's\n[49:14] imagine that you're you're deploying\n[49:15] this API gateway like this magic. I feel\n[49:18] like we need another scale about how the\n[49:20] how the organ how the organization is\n[49:22] done like if it's if it's like team team\n[49:26] topology or whatever.\n[49:28] >> Yes. Because that's what a lot Ben\n[49:30] Israeli figured out after he left AWS\n[49:33] and why AWS CDK works so well in in AWS\n[49:35] but doesn't work in other organizations\n[49:39] >> because\n[49:40] >> because in AWS they have a two pizza\n[49:42] team they have an S sur uh as part of\n[49:44] the team. The team is responsible for\n[49:46] all of the observability for every\n[49:48] paging alert that happens. It goes to\n[49:50] the product team. They are deploying 100\n[49:52] times a days. They get the alerts. They\n[49:54] have their their product uh you know\n[49:57] reliability and their runbooks.\n[49:58] Everything is managed by the team. But\n[50:00] in a lot of organizations there's still\n[50:02] a very strict separation where you have\n[50:04] a security team responsible for the IM\n[50:06] roles and other team responsible for\n[50:07] other things and that's where team\n[50:09] topologies are are are then making it\n[50:12] obvious.\n[50:13] >> Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I'm I'm been\n[50:15] working with strict separation, you\n[50:18] know, separation of duty type outfits\n[50:22] for like a decade now. So, I'm pretty\n[50:24] I'm pretty like\n[50:27] I don't know how to describe I I I don't\n[50:30] even know what it's like to be in an\n[50:32] autonomous team anymore.\n[50:35] >> Yeah. So, so\n[50:37] >> it's it's crazy that AWS can do that in\n[50:40] a way considering you know\n[50:42] >> you know where I like\n[50:44] >> very nicely and a public artifact of\n[50:47] this as an example as part of AWS CDK\n[50:51] and the the whole CDK ecosystem they\n[50:53] built this thing called the construct\n[50:55] hub. So the construct helper if you go\n[50:57] to constructs.dev\n[50:59] I think it is is a place that you can\n[51:02] find every single construct that was\n[51:04] built and remember constructs are\n[51:06] usually you know L2s or L3s built by the\n[51:10] community. Yeah. Constructs.dev. So\n[51:12] these are amazing. Um\n[51:16] they are they're like the terapform\n[51:18] module registry but instead they it\n[51:20] doesn't cover a niche technology by one\n[51:22] company IBM. um and then pedled by other\n[51:26] companies like Spacelift. Instead, this\n[51:28] is using registry of .NET, Golang, Java,\n[51:32] Python, TypeScript and its best-in-class\n[51:35] um you know artifacts or yeah artifactor\n[51:38] um artifact registries. So across all of\n[51:41] these so so this construct hub is a\n[51:44] complete public GitHub repository and if\n[51:47] you go to that public repository of the\n[51:49] source code of the construct hub you see\n[51:50] that it's a massive serverless\n[51:52] application um basically there's um\n[51:56] there's\n[51:58] what is it it's it's a kinesis stream\n[52:01] subscription or it's a stream\n[52:02] subscription\n[52:03] >> to npmgs\n[52:05] uh publish published packages right so\n[52:08] so if you go to the source\n[52:11] um you can find and the reason this is\n[52:13] public is because you can deploy this\n[52:14] within your organization. So it tells\n[52:16] you exactly how you can operate this\n[52:18] within your organization. For example,\n[52:19] you have your own private registry of\n[52:21] npm your own net registry that you don't\n[52:23] want to be public and you want to make\n[52:25] it this construct hub available within\n[52:27] your enterprise you can do that and and\n[52:30] it has documentation with guide books\n[52:33] exactly what is the alert that's set up\n[52:35] like there's a backup bucket uh in in a\n[52:38] separate region. So if a region is down,\n[52:40] all of your registry downloads are still\n[52:42] available in a separate region and this\n[52:43] is how you do a failover and this is how\n[52:45] you do that. These docs are amazing. So\n[52:47] when I saw this, I was like now I\n[52:50] understand how a product team can build\n[52:53] something and has like very detailed\n[52:55] runtime guidelines on on how to observe\n[52:57] and react to alerts and why that alert\n[52:59] exists because it creates all of the\n[53:00] Cloudatch alerts. It tells you exactly\n[53:02] why the alert is triggering and how to\n[53:04] handle that that instance. So that's on\n[53:05] one side like a two pizza team. You want\n[53:07] to see a beautiful implementation or a\n[53:09] product delivered by a two pizza team,\n[53:11] you look at the construct hub. It's I\n[53:14] looked at it, it was amazing.\n[53:15] >> So I mean these the these people the two\n[53:19] pizza team has to be like super mature\n[53:22] to take take on all these\n[53:25] this uh this responsibility I suppose.\n[53:29] But mean but meanwhile most most\n[53:31] companies are designed to to silo\n[53:35] responsibility for for lots of good\n[53:38] reason\n[53:38] >> because once you start talking about\n[53:40] compliance and and those initiatives\n[53:42] then now you need to align and you need\n[53:45] to like do across all of your your teams\n[53:48] you need to make sure that the the\n[53:49] technology they are using are are are\n[53:51] similar so that you can push through\n[53:53] huge initiatives. you know, you have\n[53:54] have one team doing it like this and\n[53:56] another team doing it all on on Google\n[53:58] Cloud, you know, it's it's extremely\n[54:01] difficult difficult to get like um\n[54:03] compliant and I guess like AWS is really\n[54:06] good at that as well. Um but most\n[54:08] enterprise main main you know business\n[54:13] is not about doing all of that, right? I\n[54:15] mean AWS is a company providing cloud\n[54:18] services and they they are building\n[54:19] cloud services and they have a great\n[54:21] team to build cloud services. So that\n[54:24] makes sense.\n[54:26] Most companies the DevOps um you know\n[54:29] type of of of initiatives are\n[54:33] part of an operational team that is\n[54:36] short staffed and that needs uh\n[54:38] alignment across the teams and centrally\n[54:41] controlled and um and that's where team\n[54:44] topologies come in right. So, so which\n[54:47] so which tooling by that explanation\n[54:50] would they gravitate to in your opinion?\n[54:58] I believe with with things like AWS CDK\n[55:01] and Construct Hub, you can have a\n[55:03] platform team that builds really\n[55:04] powerful constructs for the rest of the\n[55:06] organization. constructs that make sure\n[55:09] that the the patterns used by the\n[55:11] product teams are supported and can be\n[55:13] easily integrated within compliance\n[55:14] initiatives and and zero trust and all\n[55:16] those you know crossorganizational\n[55:19] um effort that you don't want to go\n[55:20] through every team and try to fix them\n[55:22] up. You want to give them an approved\n[55:25] and and rubber stamped.\n[55:26] >> Yeah, that's exactly what happens in my\n[55:28] current gig right now. We create\n[55:30] constructs for for other teams to use.\n[55:34] >> Yes. And and that requires your platform\n[55:37] team not to come from pure operational\n[55:39] background, right? requires your con\n[55:41] your platform team to understand how to\n[55:42] do object-oriented programming, how to\n[55:44] define an interface, how to integrate\n[55:46] that like iterate on that interface, how\n[55:48] to do you know contracts across teams,\n[55:50] how to test against those contract\n[55:52] contracts and then you come to an\n[55:54] organization that's using Terraform\n[55:56] because the old system administrators\n[55:58] that like config files never wrote uh\n[56:01] actual object oriented interface or\n[56:03] whatever and then they cannot deal with\n[56:07] CDK. they cannot deal with like all of\n[56:10] these like program.\n[56:12] >> Yeah. Well, we we tr we uh\n[56:16] >> I I sound because I'm I'm a bit\n[56:18] frustrated because I was in a lot of\n[56:20] those things where I try to to introduce\n[56:22] this and and I always get like the\n[56:24] feedback like you know Terraform is\n[56:26] simple why do you make it so complicated\n[56:28] but in reality Terraform is not simple\n[56:30] and one year down the line two years\n[56:32] down the line you have Terraform modules\n[56:34] that have such a complex interface\n[56:36] there's no testing because you have\n[56:38] never thought about like actual software\n[56:39] testing on your infrastructure as code\n[56:41] Okay, cool. But you're actually doing\n[56:43] infrastructure as\n[56:44] >> comp. We need and we need to wrap up in\n[56:46] five minutes. I need to run out and drop\n[56:48] my kids off to school. But like\n[56:52] >> but just on this point\n[56:55] uh you you develop constructs for for\n[56:58] for um for other people in your\n[57:01] organization to use, right?\n[57:05] But but the trouble is the trouble is is\n[57:07] that\n[57:09] um\n[57:11] let me just get this clear. Do you\n[57:12] expect people to use your constructs via\n[57:15] a config.yaml or do you expect them to\n[57:18] use like a a like a Python uh library or\n[57:22] something?\n[57:24] >> Yeah. So I think there's very different\n[57:27] personas. Um, and I think as a platform\n[57:31] team, what you should be building\n[57:35] maybe exposes a flat interface like a\n[57:37] YAML, but I don't like YAML. At least it\n[57:39] should be JSON schema type YL so that\n[57:42] they get an error if they use a field\n[57:44] that is not there, right? You can do\n[57:46] YAML uh\n[57:48] >> with JSON schema or use most companies\n[57:51] use pedantic. Pedantic\n[57:54] >> pedantic on YAML. I never tried that.\n[57:56] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[57:57] >> But how does pedantic work? It must must\n[57:59] have some type of schema for the data\n[58:01] structure behind it.\n[58:02] >> Yeah. So so basically pedantic if I\n[58:04] understand correctly\n[58:06] it uh it has its own model. So so the\n[58:12] the you the way they use pedantic is\n[58:13] that you you read in that YAML and then\n[58:15] you compare it against the model and the\n[58:17] model is very powerful. You know you can\n[58:19] you can express anything in that model.\n[58:22] >> Okay. And then the model basically tells\n[58:24] you if if it's um yeah how what what all\n[58:27] the configs going to be and and if the\n[58:29] config yl is valid and\n[58:32] >> s so forth and it's used a lot.\n[58:35] >> Yeah. So what the way I handled like the\n[58:37] problem with YAML with it being so\n[58:40] unstructured is that we use YAML often\n[58:43] as an input for generating\n[58:46] um well if you put it on top of\n[58:48] Terraform you can do the Terraform plan\n[58:50] preview to see how how messed up you did\n[58:53] when you agreed to it.\n[58:55] >> But it it sounds like such a this whole\n[58:58] this whole area with the governor. Okay,\n[59:01] I do want to bring this back to we I\n[59:04] guess we can continue but like what what\n[59:07] what of all these technologies that we\n[59:09] sort of try to map out here badly what\n[59:13] do you think AI is going to help any of\n[59:16] these problems that we have at the\n[59:18] moment like the teams\n[59:21] the devx\n[59:25] did\n[59:25] >> so I did a podcast about a year ago\n[59:27] about the AI and the infrastructure and\n[59:29] They compared it as a new way of doing\n[59:31] click ops. Basically, you just have\n[59:33] these rampant LLMs just going around\n[59:35] creating things across different areas\n[59:37] where you have no idea. So the main\n[59:39] point of bringing AI to an organization,\n[59:41] I think we might have talked about this\n[59:43] already was that we need to guide the AI\n[59:46] with rules and sandboxes and there's\n[59:48] several organization like several um\n[59:51] tool tooling suppliers like stackpack\n[59:53] that are focused on.\n[59:54] >> So basically basically we're going to be\n[59:56] in this area in AI\n[1:00:00] We're we're we're headed to the\n[1:00:02] governance\n[1:00:04] side of things.\n[1:00:06] >> Uh yeah, I mean in a way it's like you\n[1:00:11] see what Cloud Skills is doing and and\n[1:00:13] now Kira superpowers. It's all about\n[1:00:16] giving the LLM directions, right? And\n[1:00:19] and and right now they're generic, but\n[1:00:21] I'm sure a lot of organizations adopting\n[1:00:22] AI are are creating internal rules,\n[1:00:26] right? They're saying okay uh if you're\n[1:00:28] using cloud use our rules use our skills\n[1:00:31] directory internally within our\n[1:00:32] organization. What kind of rules would\n[1:00:34] there be? Like use\n[1:00:35] >> if you want to deploy the integration\n[1:00:37] points for a VPC are in this repository.\n[1:00:40] Don't create a VPC for scratch. There's\n[1:00:42] an existing one and this is how you find\n[1:00:43] the information about it. Right? Our\n[1:00:47] ingress is handled through our CDN layer\n[1:00:50] and uh we must follow these rules so on\n[1:00:54] right like the platform team uh are\n[1:00:56] here. This is the registry where you can\n[1:00:58] find information about the different\n[1:01:00] integration points. as a product team,\n[1:01:02] you're going to have to integrate into\n[1:01:03] the platform team or the cloud.\n[1:01:05] >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that that makes\n[1:01:07] sense, but I'm just thinking aloud that\n[1:01:10] um\n[1:01:12] how is this actually governed? So,\n[1:01:16] so you have the rules and and you and\n[1:01:18] like say say u a product team. Oh\n[1:01:21] I need to go. But okay, we need to pick\n[1:01:25] up here. We need to pick up here about\n[1:01:26] how AI is going to work in a typical\n[1:01:29] organization. Why did we end up talking\n[1:01:31] about this? Because you asked me about\n[1:01:33] CDKTF and I just went on my classic\n[1:01:37] rant.\n[1:01:38] >> Yeah, we can we can reflect. Okay, I\n[1:01:41] I'll catch up with you in a bit. Uh\n[1:01:43] probably tomorrow, right?\n[1:01:44] >> Yeah, tomorrow because I in a bit I'll\n[1:01:47] also be on the road.\n[1:01:48] >> Okay. So,\n[1:01:49] >> okay. Good one. Thanks, Vincent.",

I do my silent\nprayers and curse the forces of the day\nat Hashi Corp.\n>> Yeah. So that CDKF thing uh got you\nactivated. So did you what did you do\nafter hearing that news? Cuz I thought\nthat project I I was I I think we\ndiscussed this project. No one was using\nit. I mean, or what was my impression?\n>> Triggered. Triggered.\n>> Triggered.\n>> He's pushing buttons, right? This guy\nwoke up fresh. I don't know what I don't\nknow what you want to, you know, get off\nbefore we start.\n>> Okay. So, anyone who's not aware, um,\nand this is my version of the story,\nright? My my my side of the story. Um\nwhen I woke up on Thursday last week um\nIBM\nhas decided to sunset CDKTF\neven though that the week before that\nthey were all there with and um with all\nthe people from AWS and if you don't if\nyou're not aware CDKTF kind of\ncollaboration between AWS and Hashi Corp\nbecause CDK is is um is an AWS uh\ntoolkit cloud development toolkit and\nonly really successful for AWS cloud\nitself with AWS CDK there is some CDK TF\nfor Azure but you know there's bicep and\nand Google I think they they try to use\nconfig um what's it config manager or\nconfig connect it's like crossplane or\num based kubernetes based\num so yeah it was sunset to be honest I\nhave been trying to fork the repository\nand nobody did anything the repository\nhad not received any love or any\nupdates. It was still pinned to version\n1.6 of Terraform and I think they\nreleased 1.13 lately.\n>> Uh most of the features that came to\nTerraform since 1.7 and I think 1.7 is\nwhen the whole BSL fork happened uh I\nthink with 1.8.\n>> So ever since then\n>> you might as well go open tofu right at\nthis point.\n>> Absolutely. So, so the the m so after\nthe sunset event um which was posted on\nReddit and hacker news and on LinkedIn\nuh most of the comments on on Reddit\nterraform obviously was nobody's using\nit right uh no let it die right hate\nthose people why would people say that\nright and and then\n>> several of course Puli jumped on the\nopportunity it's like yeah CDKF is like\ntwo years younger than Pulumi so Pulumi\ncame out first and it was kind of like a\nhalfbaked effort from Hashi Corp to try\nand emulate what Palumi provides. I\ndon't think that's really the case. I\nmean maybe it was\n>> actually I've not used Palumi in anger\nso I don't know what to say about it.\n>> Yeah. So I did a very fun talk at DevOps\nDay Singapore about how Terraform\nHashikorp language is a horrible way for\ndevelopers to manage their\ninfrastructure and goodness that there's\nonly few other options such as Pulumi\nbut nobody used it and somebody in the\naudience obviously took offense to that\nand um told me to do a a co-presentation\nfor the AWS uh community day in\nSingapore in June and um and I got\nschooled\ncuz um I was like um this is how I have\nto do it with CDKTF and he was like oh\nin Pulumi it's literally like one line.\nOh okay. So he kind of showed me the way\nand I have to say Pulumi is impressive.\nUm the only problem is and kind of how I\nchanged my presentation because my\npresentation was all about how so much\neasier it is to use CDKTF than Terraform\nmodules. And the fact is that he was\nshowing all of my examples with Pulumi\nand they looked even easier with Pulumi.\nNo, they look the same. Let's be honest,\nthey look the same. Um so then um I\nchanged my pitch mid presentation to\nbasically say so many organizations have\nlike two to three years Terraform\nfootprint with like you know known\nautomation solutions such as Atlantis or\nGitHub workflows that are all built\naround Terraform you know security\nscanners all built around Terraform IC\nso it's very hard sell as a product\nengineer who wants to build a product\nand leverage\nyou know, a queue and a lambda and the\ntool has to be connected and you don't\ncare how, right? And you do do\nserverless. You're building this\nbeautiful API gateway with all of its\nendpoints going through ECS Fargate\ncontainers for long running jobs or\ndirectly to lambdas for a quick response\nand you don't care to learn about five\ndifferent Terraform modules with 40\ndifferent variable inputs and how do you\nconfigure an API gateway, right? So for\nserverless, you know, AWS CDK is\namazing, but you know, try to come to\nyour platform team and say, \"Yes, I know\nyou guys have this amazing Terraform uh\npull request previews and and and\nscanning code and and and all this\nstuff, but I want to use AWS CDK. I want\nand then they have to start supporting\ncloud for uh or even you know more go\ntowards them and say I want to adopt\npulley and now they have to think about\npulley um into this pipeline. Although\nthat pulley's strong point is that they\nmake um trans migration from Terraformed\nto their cloud very easy. Obviously they\nare backed by the original Terraform\nproviders. So they have a lot of\nmigration paths.\n>> Yeah. I'm just looking at Palumi now.\nThey seem to support every language\nunder the sun\n>> even YAML. Yeah, you can even put YAML\nas an input and you get uh you get\ninfrastructure as code.\n>> So do they do they have tools to to\nconvert the Terraform into into\n>> language? They have a very powerful I\nthink they can even interact with the\nterraform back end directly right so you\ncan have them side by side you don't\nneed to migrate everything immediately\nthe only problem is you have to now sign\na contract with Palumi and then you have\nto you know\n>> so you're so the big problem with Palumi\nis that it's a commercial non-free thing\nright\n>> well when when the BSL announcement came\nbasically when Hashi Corp announced that\nthe source code was uh available but not\nallowed to be used in competing compar\ncommercial platforms,\n>> the business license that they put on\nTerraform. Pulumi made a big\nannouncement how they are the real free\nversion, the real open-source\ninfrastructure as code. So, I can't\nclaim um\n>> Oh, so so they're open. Okay, hold on. I\ngot to check out the GitHub now.\nThey're open source.\n>> Yeah. And they um they also another\nfamous pro for Palumi is that SST which\nis a I think originally SST they are the\npeople that build serverless.tf TF uh\nserverless not serless.com.\n>> Yeah. SD, right?\n>> Yeah. Okay. So, so the source code is\nApache 2 licensed. Okay. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So,\n>> but I'm guessing they have have a model\nbecause I see they see looks like they\nhave like a a cloud UI, right?\n>> Yeah. So, they're they're like Terraform\nCloud, right? They they give you the\nability to very quickly get started.\nJust sign up to their cloud and get your\nPulumi code ready. And the terraform\ncloud is is essentially non-free, right?\n>> Yeah. They both under management pricing\nmodels, right? I think we talked about\nthat\n>> very first time back in September when\nthere was this uh announcement of open.\n>> Okay. So, Palumi seems to be in a good\nposition to deal with the CDKTF fallout\nthen, right?\n>> Yeah. And they even have made their AWS\nCDK adapter generally available. So\nCDKTF had this in in um technical\npreview since its inception and for five\nyears it was still in technical preview\nuntil it got uh you know shut down\ntogether with CDKTF. So the the adapter\nbasically your team can write AWS CDK\ncode and the adapter converts the the\ngenerating cloud formation into pulley\nequivalents allows your teams to quickly\nconvert your AWS CDK to pulley as well.\nstill that doesn't sound quite right to\nme because even if you convert your\ncloud information to Palumi, how the\nhell are you going to, you know?\n>> Yeah, it's I think this is just a um\n>> marketing\n>> just marketing and just to allow people\nto quickly do a PC on Palumi and then\nsee the benefits of the cloud. I guess\nthere is a benefit compared to cloud\nformation, right? It's very frustrating\ncloud formation sometimes when you kick\noff a roll out and then it gets stuck\nand it does a roll back and you have to\nwait an hour and and it's it's this\ncloud for all or nothing behavior that\nis sometimes very frustrating the\nability for cloud form to you know lose\ntrack of resources if the logical ID\nchanges. So that's where like terraform\nand puli are like advantage have\nadvantages because of the the way they\ntrack state. They allow you to more\ncarefully refactor your state, but they\ndon't have this all or nothing guarantee\nlike cloud form, right? Cloud formation\nis really like a database transaction.\nYou kick off a roll out, it's going to\ngo through. If it doesn't, it's going to\ntry and roll back, which honestly also\ndoesn't always work, right? Sometimes\nthere will be something blocking it.\nYeah. And then the roll back fails. So\nthat's where people are like, oh, the\nAWS CDK is awesome. Cloud formation is\nhorrible. um and then they maybe have a\nlot of issues with like managing the\noverall teams\n>> um interaction with cloud form stack. So\npulley is in a really great position.\nThey also have SSD.\n>> So SSD originally serless were built on\ncloud form and SAML um SAM sorry not\nSAML uh SAM the\n>> yeah I'm I'm an AWS SAM guy kind of guy\nto be honest.\n>> Yeah and SST was kind of like\nreplicating SAM on top of AWS CDK. So\nyou don't have to work with the AWS CDK\nabstractions but for example you can say\nI want open next deployed as serverless\non top of lambdas. So SST gave you that\num it take care of everything like I\nwant an application right I don't care\nabout lambdas\n>> I'm just clicking around Palumi I guess\nlooks like it's done a quite a good job\nI'd say on the face of it\n>> it's just it's just the ball breaker is\nthe fact that they will\ncatch you in their in their web of the\nthe\n>> cloud costs\n>> the cloud costs\n>> so there's there's no there's no open\nsource\n>> there is cloud so\nThere was one of the uh misconceptions I\nhad as well about Pulumi was that I\nheard that it was expensive and you\ncan't self-host but you can you can move\nyour cloud hosted back end to an S3\nbucket but the the the counter to that\nis then but now you have to manage all\nof this cross team uh rolebased access\ncontrol you know all the enterprise\nfeatures that come around\n>> oh yeah software\n>> orchestration and all that sort of\nstuff.\n>> So so then you need to take that on\nyourself. Yeah. And and in that aspect\nin in the Terraform ecosystem, you have\na lot of open source projects, right?\nAnd you can choose between um Spacelift\num you can choose between Terra Team or\num you you can choose Terra Mate or\nTerra Grand or Terra Grand Scale. So\nthere's so many options around Terraform\nand for Purimi we didn't have that many.\nHowever, Spacelift and others say yes,\nyou can also manage pulley with us.\nWe're also hosting an S3 bucket and\nwe're coupling it together with your\nterraform. So, so yeah, that's that's\nwhy most of the reactions Yeah.\n>> So, the\nlet me I'm I'm just\nlet me just share my screen. I was I\njust I just want to map out where\ninfrastructure is at then.\nSorry.\nAnd then we haven't even talked about um\nsystem initiative and uh and\n>> I hope I hope to catch up with um with\nAdam at the config management camp in\nGent.\n>> Yeah, you give you a beautiful demo.\n>> Let me just trying to think.\nI don't know how to do the scale here,\nbut I was I was going to put like maybe\nthis terraform here\nand then this Palumi here\nand Palumi has seems to be the last.\n>> I would put AWS CDK all the way on the\nright. That is like the benchmark for me\n>> because it came first.\nM no I don't think I think Palumi came\nbe around the same time or at the same\ntime or little bit earlier to AWS CDK\nmaybe\n>> okay that okay so we have to pre prefix\nthis with AWS infrastructure\n>> and then I mean I was going to put it\nhere but like anyway\nso most\n>> yeah for me it goes more to the right to\npuli because because it it has this\nlittle additional library like next to\nAWS CDK Here you can put SST because\nthat is on top of poly\n>> SST.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. So I was going to maybe put use a\nscale of like I don't know features\nbecause you I mean let's be we've talked\nabout this before but you can't do\nuh well lambda and serless very easily\non the terraform level.\nSo you need something like\n>> it depends what features you're talking\nabout because features are related to\ndeveloper experience or operational\nexperience um and and how you like do\n>> um previews plan previews and things\nlike that.\n>> Well\nand rolebased access control.\n>> Um I'm thinking developer experience. I\nmean what do you mean operational\nexperience like how easy it is to to\nmanage or\n>> to refactor? uh for example let's say as\na company we start with a single\noffering and we build a VPC with like\nsome lambdas and so on and then later on\nwe spin off\n>> I would always feature agility\noperational then\n>> yeah agility\n>> yeah so so\n>> so you're you're only looking at one\ndimension operational features\n>> yeah well I I sent you the link but I\nmean be good to explore\nthe dimensions.\n>> I uh yeah, let me try and add the\ndeveloper experience dimension.\n>> So, um\n>> just bossing you around.\n>> I mean, cloud form is probably at the\nbloody bottom, isn't it? I mean, it's a\nnightmare to work with.\n>> No,\n>> cloudformation is at the same level as\nTerraform. Come on, be honest.\n>> Going to give you that.\nI've refacted Terraform plenty of time.\n>> Okay.\n>> The tooling is good. cloudformation like\nyou it's you.\n>> So we I'm going to create a separate\nscale for developer experience.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh wow. Hyperland does not\n>> I'm going to I'm going to put AWS SAM in\nthe middle just because\n>> I'm on Arch by the way. I'm going to say\nlike six times during this call.\nDo you know I started I started my\nchannel by making Archix installed\nvideos for noobs like you.\n>> No, I didn't have to install it.\n>> Oh, yeah. You're using Omar. You're\nusing uh what's it called?\n>> Omari.\n>> Omari.\n>> Yeah, that's that's how way he pronounce\nit, right?\n>> Yeah. But you were sending me\nscreenshots of Hyperland crashing or\nsomething, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's why I'm on Arch.\nfor the uh crash experiences. I think\nArch cannot run this website. Uh cannot\nrun um Xcoly draw.\n>> What?\n>> Maybe developer experience goes the\nother way or I think the same direction.\n>> What's okay define developer experience.\n>> Yeah, as a DevOps engineer you should\nknow this.\n>> Well,\n>> okay.\nBasically we are not devops engineer we\nare platform engineers and one of the\nthings that we should focus on is to\nprovide our developers the tools so that\nthey can take ownership on the services\nthat they built and run in production.\n>> Okay. Okay.\n>> And the developer experience comes with\num you know the the easiness at which\nthey can define their production\nworkloads.\n>> Yeah. So my my points of what my point\nof mental reference is like you know net\nlefi and u up cell and things like that.\n>> So essentially what what they need to\ntwiddle with is is a config yaml and uh\na CLI tool or something like that and\nthat that's it right that that's that's\nmy point of reference. Of course, so\nmany companies just do it so much more\nconvolutely convolut in a awkward way.\nFly.io.\n>> What did you say you you you called\n>> Netlfi? Netlfi.\n>> Yeah. So, they all work in a similar\nway. There's some CLI and there's some\nconfig YAML\n>> or toml.\nMaybe I should do a scale for cost\nlike or enterprise adoption or something\nlike that\nbecause some of these things like Palumi\nis going to get expensive.\nEnterprise\nI don't know. So, anything I select\ndoesn't show up on my on my browser. I\nthink there's a problem with Chromium to\nbe honest. Um, I'm on a Chromium browser\n>> on a fork\n>> and uh and doesn't render properly\nsometimes.\n>> So, Palumi is going to be expensive. I\nthink cloudformation terraform is a bit\ntricky cuz\nNo, I mean Terraform is good because you\ndon't need to pay for rum.\nNo rum.\nI think you cannot put operational\nfeatures AWS\nabove terraform\nor maybe\n>> I I mean I love it. I love it\n>> because it's backed by CFN. So you must\nhave the same problems like losing\nlogical um logical ID for resources\nloses the actual resource ownership.\nAlthough they have added a lot of new\nfeatures to cloud form to help you\nrefactor your code. But yeah, the main\nreason there is that organizations\nconstantly change the names. Oh, we did\na we we had um an offsite of the with\nthe sea level team and we decided to\nmerge our AI team with our data team and\nthen all of these resources that were AI\nteam.\n>> I love what you I love what you said uh\na few chats ago with changing of IDs.\nYou were saying that like uh you should\njust use labels, right, to address\nresources\n>> and not and use opaque IDs. I mean I\nreally that stuck with me. I need to do\nthat more.\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n>> Oh, and convince people you don't have\nto name a bloody bucket this certain\nway.\n>> And that's something that cloud form\nkind of forces upon you or AWS CDK,\nright? By default, it doesn't even allow\nyou to define the physical ID of\nresources. And it and then I had some\nsome um colleagues and they were like,\n\"No, no, this load balancer has to be\nnamed exactly like this because I need\nto be able to find it in the console.\"\nAnd I'm like, \"No,\n>> no,\n>> no.\nthen you have to deploy the same stack\ntwice and you you get an error because\nthe load balancer identity like physical\nID does already exist like\n>> you know and then I got this whole\ndiscussion with the team manager after\nthe guy that tried to do what I I\nwouldn't allow him to do raised it up to\nour our manager and then said yeah come\non Vincent we we're not deploying the\nsame application twice in the same AWS\naccount and it's like Well, yes, we are.\nAnd we are consolidating more of our\ninfrastructure. So,\n>> okay. I mean, I think you're being a\nlittle bit danty. I mean, to be honest,\nI make assumptions right now. The thing\nI'm working with and I need to make it\nuh talk to each other at some point\nsoon. Okay. So,\num yeah. Uh well, I thought I mean I\nlike to fill this void. I do think AWS\nOkay. AWS is so specific to serless,\nit's probably not worth beating around\nabout.\nUh\nI'm probably going to copy.\nThis is so difficult because the\nfunctionality is not comparable, is it?\n>> Copy it or just drag it.\n>> Oh, sorry. I meant to copy it. Hold on.\nLet me copy my\nOkay. I don't know. We've just been\ndragging things around. Maybe we should\nwe got to start somewhere. Let's\n>> say what we what we mean by this.\n>> Okay. Your developer experience.\nUm I'm I'm really surprised you put\nTerraform right rock bottom. I mean\nTerraform has an incredible developer\nexperience.\n>> No,\n>> it does.\n>> It's a horrible developer experience.\n>> It's the worst.\n>> Okay. So, okay. I I think Okay, you're\ncoming from a developer point of view.\nOkay. You're like the guy says like I\ndon't understand this. What is this TF\nfile?\n>> Why do you s make a whiny voice when\nyou're the emulator developer a product\nengineer?\n>> What I'm saying is Terraform um is\nexposing every single API resource of\nthe cloud of the SAS that you're\ninteracting with, right? Either the\ncloud provider or um you know whatever\num is it or whatever you're you're\nyou're talking to. Every single API\nendpoint must be configured and then\nmust be linked together. So if you're\nsetting up an API gateway and a lambda,\nyou must set up the IM role and the IM\npolicy to you know provide lambda\npermissions. Then you have to do you\nknow the lambda trust policy. Then you\nhave to set up lambda permissions to\nallow the gate API gateway service to\ninvoke the lambda that you have to do\nwith terapform.\n>> Yeah. And then you have to do it for\nevery possible scenario that those\nthings can be combined together, right?\n>> Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I I'm just trying\nI'm just trying to come up with the\nright word. You have to basically\n>> manage everything and it's\n>> Yeah. As a developer and many people\nalways came to me when I was purely\nTerraform only guy um and said like look\nI'm not like you. I cannot read the API\ndocs or the provider docs and figure out\nhow I need to comm connect connect all\nof these resources. Let me click ops.\nLet me go into the AWS console, click on\nthis, then click on that and then after\nthat I will try to capture everything.\n>> On the subject of click ops, is there\ngood support by any of these tools to\nbasically capture the state from from a\nfrom AWS? I think I think you should ask\nuh system initiative to give you that de\ndemo because that's one of the things\nthat he's advertising right like look\npeople have clicked and now you have to\nyou know control it so here you go\nsystem initiative doing that for you is\nthere anything that does that really\nnicely\n>> I don't think so I don't think any of\nthese tools help you fix whatever\nsomebody clicked in clicks up still in\nbut\n>> some of these tools allow you to avoid\nclickups to basically start the correct\nway um by defining it with SSD because\nthey give you that ability to say like I\nhad a gateway.\n>> I mean I I got a soft spot for click ops\nin a way just because I was on a\n>> I was on a job and it took it took me\nliterally like a week just just to\ntoggle something. Wow. I'm I'm\nexaggerating, but it took a while.\n>> And I thought to myself,\n>> yeah, absolutely. So that's the problem\nwith a lot of these infrastructure as\ncode libraries is that they're built\nfrom um a very low-level perspective and\nyou can either and a lot of the tools\nthat are being built right now is to you\nknow reflect the reality of this\nnature of the cloud changing things\nunder the hood right if you create an\nRDS instance it's going to auto upgrade\nto the latest Postgress version and then\nyour Terraform's going to go like nope\nthis is supposed to be Postgress 15.\nWhat are you doing running Postgress 18\nover there? You know, let's delete this\ndatabase and recreate it.\n>> Yeah, actually\n>> dealing with dealing with data and any\nof these tools makes me a bit sweaty\n>> like uh\nwhat happened.\n>> That's interesting because that's\nexactly the argument that somebody made\njust now on a thread on Reddit because\nI'm I'm 24 hours on Reddit obviously. um\nthat\nhe just made the argument that the only\nplace you would use something like\nTerraform is to manage databases.\n>> What?\n>> Yeah. Because he says like everything\nelse is so dynamic and most of the stuff\nyou shouldn't be doing with IC. IC\nshould be done for these like um\nresources that take need additional like\noperational\n>> Okay, maybe he's got a point because\nit's got it's got more\n>> control\n>> stability aspects to it. Yeah. Yeah,\nbecause you're right. You do a because\nwith IC it's often very close to\nGitHubs, right? You need to make a\nsource code change,\n>> bring it to production.\n>> We're using Terraform to manage some\ndata right now and and uh our basically\none of our main guard rails is the plan,\nbut no one reads the plan. No one reads\nthe plan. Like we like we got like a\nnice GitHub summary to say like, oh, do\nyou know you're recreating resources\nhere?\nand they just go, \"Yeah, whatever.\nApply.\"\n>> That's weird because like first off, why\nis it recreating resources? That means\nthat and that's the hard thing about\nTerraform.\n>> Well, I I didn't want to mention the I\ndidn't want to mention the provider, but\nI'm I'm going to mention it. It's not\ngoing to incriminate anyone, but this\nthe we've been working with the snow\nsnowflake provider and it just wants to\nrecreate things very easily, but it it's\nit's it's a complicated environment to\nbe honest.\n>> Yeah. Some providers have really low\nquality.\n>> Yeah. And the snowflake one is in\nmaybe someone has made a video about it,\nbut it's it's it's came out of like I it\ncame out of like the uh the Chan\nZuckerberg Foundation or something like\nthis. It's hasn't been maintained very\nwell. Then Snowflake itself eventually\nadopted it.\n>> LOL. Oh, that's so funny. I I I used and\nthere's so many experimental features in\nit, it makes you very nervous. I mean,\nand then Snowflake is only used by the\nlike the biggest enterprises ever.\n>> Wow.\n>> We It's a very It's a very weird setup,\nbut I guess it is it is better than\nmanaging it by by hand, I like to think.\nBut still at the end of the day the the\nprovider just seems to do SQL calls or\nor like it it it lacks so much\nfunctionality you're ending up having to\nwrite these like what do you call like\nSQL execute blocks here and there and\neverywhere which\n>> yeah so so this is kind of where I feel\nwhen I started on my Terraform journey I\nwas like terraform everything right you\ncreate an RDS instance you need a\ndatabase in it well we're going to\ndefine the terraform provider for\nPostgress and we're going to connect it\nto your RDS instance and we're going to\ncreate a database and we're going to\ncreate the plug the extensions that need\nto be active on that database and it's a\nnightmare because now when you ever you\nrun Terraform you have to have a tunnel\nto connect to the Postgress instance and\nyou know once you start doing compliance\nyou need you need all types of security\naround that and and this is the type of\nstuff that it shouldn't be part of\nTerraform right like running SQL queries\nthrough a provider just to me already\nafter using it for 10 years seems\nsomething like done that been there\nnever again you know\n>> yeah okay I think we all agree I agreed\nI'm agreed with this whole developer\nexperience at the bottom here um\n>> convinced you\n>> but but at the same time the things that\nwe put at the very top don't really I\nmean that's for very narrow use cases I\nfeel like we need to have maybe two axis\nat this point because we we need\nwe We need like oh god\none access to sort of\nwe need we need the vertical access to\ntalk about um what you can do like you\nknow AWS\nfeature\n>> but that's what the defex or what\n>> scope or something like well like the\ntrouble is is that versal is good at\nsetting up a website but you can't like\nrun a database So I mean probably I mean\nmaybe it does support database\n>> because is this as a higher level\nabstraction right?\n>> Yeah. So I understood. So so basically\nit needs to go down\nyou know it needs to sink down here.\nWell well with with\n>> you just moved you just moved my devx uh\nscale to the right saying feature scope\nand and you just\n>> and then here I would say de dev\nexperience because we need to basic okay\nwe can discuss this later. I think your\nfeature scope is the devx and your your\nx-axis should be the operational\nfeatures that we we were just talking\nabout\n>> because because the feature scope here\nlike Versel has um great Devx so it\nneeds to go up there but horrible\noperational experience such as like I\nneed fine grain control to bootstrap a\ndatabase I can't do that because first\nis very high level and under the hood\nit's going to create some type of data\nstore and they take care of it which is\nlike a trade-off right\n>> yeah they're going to you like three\ndifferent types of data store and you\ndon't care how they're\n>> Yeah, you're right. You're right. The\noperational stuff comes. Yeah. Yeah.\nYou're right. You're right. You're\nright. I didn't know what SST v2 is.\nWhat the hell is that? That's just\nserverless, isn't it?\n>> So, basically the the way I understand\nit cuz I only came became familiar with\nSSD when my my friend introduced it to\nme. Um originally I think the server the\npeople that built serverless.com\nthey created um SSD on top of AWS CDK. I\nthink serverless was using SAM and maybe\ncloud form directly and then they with\nsome scripting around it and then they\ncreated um SST which is just instead of\ndirectly writing cloud form they would\njust leverage all of AWS CDK because AWS\nCDK is this amazing library that gives\nyou these beautiful integration\npatterns. If you need to create a lambda\nand a gateway and you just connect it to\nit's going to take care of everything,\nright? So you don't have to generate\nevery single cloud for resource, you\njust say here.\n>> So it's like a it's another sort of\nCDK/palumi\ntype type offering, right?\n>> No, it's it's on top of so originally it\nwas on top of cloud for then they\nrewrote it on top of um on on on AWS CDK\nand then they rewrote it on top of FUMI.\nSo SSD is like the AWS CDKL2s. Um but\nthey're trying to go like like Versel\nkind of in the middle.\n>> They are.\n>> Oh, we don't have Palumi on this top\nthing. I mean Palumi needs to be up here\nor something. I don't know.\n>> You're you're like yeah I was trying to\nduplicate it but it didn't manage to\nduplicate it. So yeah, Palumi and SST on\noperational I think there would be the\nsame.\nOkay.\n>> Yeah, SSTV1 was on AWS CDK and SSTV2 is\non top of Pulumi. Um, so\n>> how do you get exposure to all this\nstuff, man? I feel like I'm doing a lot\nand I don't get to touch some things.\nOkay. I guess you attend a lot of talks,\ndon't you?\nIt was my colleague uh sorry my ex-\nflatmate who um who who pivoted you know\noriginally started with Amplify then\nwith AWS CDK and then he says you know\nSSD is this amazing thing.\n>> Oh my god. Amplify. Oh my god. Sweet\nJesus.\n>> Yeah. But Amplify also completely wrote\nitself on top of AWS CDK. Yeah. And then\nthey just became like uh this portal\nthat you it's kind of like I think AWS\nanswer to Versel. This basically like\nallows you to create your front end to\ndeploy it.\n>> Yeah. That's true. That's true. But I I\nnever appreciated the stack.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, they completely changed the stack\nbecause originally amplify was doing\ncloud formation and now it's just doing\nlike CDK stacks and then it's just\nallowing you to manage your front-end\ndeployments, you know, your S3 contents\nand your CDN configuration from an\nabstract level. A bit like Versel really\nlike I think amplify is really like\nVersell.\n>> No, I think I think Vel is much better\nthan amplify.\n>> When was the last time you looked at\namplify? uh years ago and I I had I\nthink I think I have a GitHub project\nabout it and then it was impossible to\nlike just maintain it. So basically,\n>> yes, I know that's what amplify used to\nbe. But what I there was this uh lady\nwho posted on LinkedIn access to a Udemi\nworkshop that she had just published\nwhich was AWS AWS CDK and Amplify. And I\nand for free you got access for like two\ndays or something like that. And so I I\ndid a speedrun through it like literally\nin a day just crushed it. And um I went\nthrough the whole AWS CDK thing and the\nAmplify side of things. And this\nliterally just like a month ago, not two\nmonths ago.\n>> Yeah. And and it's really like amplify\nwhen I looked at it and I haven't used\nforcell but um it really is like oh I\nwant to do blue green experiment. Oh I\nwant to do this. It just takes care of\neverything under the hood for you and\nyou you just go here's my website source\ncode and it just take care of the whole\n>> anyway. So we can put bloody amplify\nhere. Gez.\n>> Yeah. Amplify V2 or whatever. Amplify\ncurrent\nwhatever\nnew one. Okay.\nSo,\nokay. So, now now if we\nand how do we account for the the cost\nof things? I guess let's let's just\nfocus on operational features and and\nDevX. Can are you able to copy and paste\ninto this one so that we have a a better\ngraph here? or shall I just do it?\n>> Uh, yeah. No, my my my Chromium is un\nunresponsive.\n>> Okay, so if I maybe I put Terraform on\nthe bottom here.\nCloudformation too. God, it's got a\nterrible experience.\nPalumi\nlooks like it can do a lot.\nWait, it's going to look the same, isn't\nit?\nIt's going to look the same. There's no\nthere's no DevX and operational features\nseems to be the same thing, right?\n>> I mean, Palumi and Palumi cloud I guess\nand Terraform and Terraform cloud maybe.\nUh\nso Palumi I would I would pose in terms\nof operational features a bit higher\nthan Terraform and in terms of DevOps\nkind of in the middle. Um but but\nultimately I can't help but think\nthere's no the major differentiator\nshort is going to be is just going to be\nit's just going to be price isn't it? We\nyou you like if you were like a an enter\nlike a Fortune 500 company,\nyou're not going to use um\nwell, you can't you can't use VEL and\nand things cuz that's not going to be\nenough\nand\nyou're not going to use AW CDK and\nTerraform is as we know limited.\nBut then you're gonna you're gonna\nbasically pay for Palumi. Okay, this I'm\nnot too sure where I'm going with this.\n>> Okay, I\n>> I also wanted to tie this into AI\nsomehow, but it just it look it looks\nlike Palumi is in a very good spot. And\nwe haven't even talk about we haven't\neven talked about Kubernetes, but I\ndon't want to talk about Kubernetes.\nLooks like Palumi is is on a I don't\nknow if can can we invest in Palumi?\nLooks like it's in a really good spot.\n>> Are you building a tech radar? Maybe I\nshould pull up the some famous tech\nradar.\nUm, hold on. Uh, what was I? Ah, AWS\nCDK.\n>> Not on the current edition.\n>> I would give AWS CDK highdevx but very\nlow operational experience. And then SST\ngiven it's on on Palumi would be a\nlittle bit less on the DevX side because\nthey don't they didn't build all the\nsame like service levels but on the same\nlevel as Palumi in terms of operation\nbecause it lose uses Palumi under the\nhood. Yeah.\nWhat else is there?\nDoes it make sense?\nWhere are you? I don't see you anymore.\n>> I'm here. I'm here. I was just looking\nat um Oh.\nWhat the Why does it say data dog?\n>> What the I\n>> I was just I was just looking at the uh\n>> I think you're on this\n>> the tech radar.\nThe thing the only thing it says on\nplatform to adopt is uh ARM in the\ncloud. which sounds a bit weird\nsometimes. I wonder if these people that\nmake those T radars really know what\nthey're talking about.\nI don't know where which one you're\nlooking at, but like I'm just guessing\nnow.\nUh,\nokay. Let's tie this back to AI. So we\nwe just riffed about how\nPalumi ST is is in a good spot. We we\nOh, we should we should put system\ninitiative somewhere here, right?\n>> Maybe you can take this this slide back\nwhen you talk to Adam from system\ninitiative where you put it.\n>> I'm not that I'm not that happy here,\nbut like okay, what okay say you're the\nwhat do you call it? the chief\ntechnology officer of a of a big company\nthat that had a whole bunch of AWS\naccounts\n>> only AWS.\n>> Let's say it's only AWS. Just just to\nkeep the conversation sane.\n>> Yeah.\n>> How would you begin to manage it? Like\nlet's even go even more bizarre. Let's\nsay like, oh Vincent, we need to build\nup to 100 accounts and we need to do\nthis in the space of six months.\nand or three months and you choose the\ntechnology to do it with can I assume\nthat Vincent would choose Palumi\nand there's no budget I mean\n>> it would be between Palumi and or\nbetween SST and AWS CDK yes if there's\nno budget limitation\nmaybe more towards SST then\n>> but SST doesn't have a a cloud and man\nand governance and or\n>> I think they may have runners but They\nthey basically\noriginally SSD they had their own like\ndeployment pipelines but since they\ncompletely pinned themselves on pulley I\nwould imagine that they are completely\npowered by Palumi deployments.\n>> Okay it sounds like Palumi. So okay so\nyou would explain once once more why SST\nand and and Palumi and AWS CDK and cloud\nfor what the relationship is right you\nunderstand AWS CDK. So AWS CDK is to\ncloud formation what SST is to pull. In\nother words, Pulumi gives you the\nlow-level concept of an IM role, an IM\npolicy and a bucket and an API gateway\nand a lambda. And then SST gives you the\nconcept of I have an um an API gateway\nthat's backed by a lambda and write\n>> higher level patterns, right?\n>> Yeah. SSD level two level threes and\n>> yeah and then and then Puni they have\ntwo different providers they have the\npure terraform provider converted on top\nof their own engine so they they run the\nengine the configuration that you\nprovide is in programming language or\nYAML or whatever they they run that\ninside a runtime they convert your\nprogram into configuration that then\ngets um executed right so if if you look\nat it like cdktf I to me pum and CDKTF\nis very similar um is that you write\nTypeScript code or Golang code or Python\ncode and it generates configuration for\nthe Terraform provider and PUMI their\ninternal representation of whatever that\ncloud plug-in is right if they targeting\nAWS it's a plug-in for AWS this they\noriginally just ported the provider AW\nfor Terraform for AWS right PMI was just\nporting the Terraform provider and then\nbuilding a programmatic interface on top\nof it I think they may like refactored\nthe way that that works because now they\nhave all kinds of hooks system. So while\nyou are your program is executing some\nof your program execution is happening\nwhile it's deploying things inside the\ncloud. So if you look at Terraform, you\nyou have a configuration and then the\nprovider is executing the configuration\nand then the provider is you know config\nlike sending the request to the API do\nthis then send the request to the API do\nthis right and Terraform\ndoes not really have a lot of features\nthat allows you to mit deployment\nexecute this function and then based on\nthe output do something else right by\ndesign because originally Terraform was\nmeant to be very deterministic very\npredict predictable so that you are able\nto to know this is the exact\nconfiguration what I want all of these\nresources to look right right but with\npulley you have like this on on event\ntype of things um you can you can hook\ninto the process and if you're deploying\nto a region that only has two\navailability zones you automatically\nlike um adjust the configuration towards\nit right so yeah so pulley has these\nlike events um and I think AWS CDK has\nsimilar things because while you are you\nknow as as a as a product engineer\ndefining this is what I need to deploy.\nIt will also hook into the target\nenvironment depending on how you are um\ncalling the the constructs. They can\nbasically decide that okay I I just I\njust downloaded the whole VPC setup. I\nknow there's two subnetss and they are\ninto the these these availability zones.\nI know all of this information which is\ncalled the context of the environment\nthat you're deploying into and they can\nreconfigure or generate cloud form\nstacks accordingly.\n>> I didn't even I've never written a CDK\nlike that. Um\n>> yeah that's that's what context\nproviders do and and then to make sure\nthat still deterministic that context\nthat was used to basically determine how\nthe uh cloudformation stack is generated\nis also stored on disk. So you can then\nput that into your GitHub um into your\nversion control sorry git and then you\ncan um you know rerun the context lookup\nto update your context. So then if you\nwant to change things for example maybe\nmaybe one day you are targeting\nSingapore region and it only has two\navailability zones uh but the next time\nSingapore introduced the third\navailability zone and you don't want all\nof your cloudformation\n>> you're blowing my mind here CDK you\nwould check in something into your in\n>> the context yes so so\n>> I've never seen that done I mean the CDK\nis all managed in cloudformation\nis how I understood it\n>> CD no CDK generates cloudformation but\nin the process of generating cloud form.\nIt can do some callouts to your\nenvironment to determine how to best\ngenerate the cloudformation.\n>> Do you have an example of a context\nchecked into Git? I guess it's all going\nto be\n>> Yeah, the one that I I was just talking\nabout and the example that they give why\nyou should checking your context is\nexactly what I just said like let's say\nthat the new availability zone is\nintroduced and that kind of like deter\nsubnetting logic that you have a whole\nlike subnet for this particular tier of\nof of your\n>> blowing my mind. I didn't really know\nabout this context. I have I have to\nlook it up. And then and then and then\nwhen you do CDK bootstrap it it creates\nlike three different bloody places for\nthings or something if I remember\ncorrectly.\n>> Yes. because CDK is very enterprise\nfocused allowing you to exactly control\nhow to um you know how the the the\nbootstrap happens right like what are\nthe basically CDK has this asset\nbundling pipeline and that's why it\nbootstraps so many things because if you\ndo terraform you just need to find a way\nfor example to put an object into a S3\nbucket so that your lambda can point to\nit and then deploy the source code from\nthe S3 object or maybe your lambda wants\nto be deployed from a docker image so\nyou need to use ECR So these asset\nrepositories uh the ECR and the S3\nbucket are very important in the way\nthat you deploy your code and this is\nmore important if you do serverless\nbecause you know you have all of these\nsnippets of of of code that that need to\nbe coordinated together with your Lambda\num configuration and the environment\nvariables and everything right so AWS\nCDK has a built-in asset pipeline and\nand and part of the things that it\nbootstrap is all of the necessary\nsupporting um architecture for that\nasset pipeline it will create an ECR\nrepository so that it you know, so that\nthey can build a Docker image part of\nthe, you know, bundling aspect of your\nof your application and then deploy that\nthat Docker image in or push that Docker\nimage into the um into ECR the asset\nregistry for Docker images or you know\npush the bucket maybe which is an ES ES\nbuild bundled NodeJS with all of its\ndependencies and whatever AWS SDK is\nexternal needs to be external because\nthat's provided within the runtime. So\nall of that is taken care of by AWS CDK\nbecause it has this beautiful asset\npipeline, right?\n>> Well, I noticed it in one in my\nworkplace that when AWCDK deploys this\nFargate pattern or whatever, it's\nbuilding the Docker image in the same\npipeline. And I thought to myself,\n>> yeah,\n>> that's not cool.\n>> It depends. So as soon as the Docker\nfile build fails with some rate limit,\nthen then the whole deployment fails.\nThat's a joke in my opinion.\n>> Uh to be honest,\nif you are coming from a developer\nexperience perspective, not being\nbothered by how exactly your code gets\nbundled up and and made available to be\ndeployed is kind of a feature that you\nwant and that's why they have it, right?\nThis asset pipeline thing. From looking\nback when I started with AWS and\nTerraform, I very strictly said, okay,\nyour code, for example, your website and\nyour bundle, the way that like assets\nare getting deployed is very\ndisconnected from your infrastructure,\nright? Classically,\n>> I'm not so sure I'm a big believer that\nbecause because these things,\n>> it's wrong. What I just said is wrong.\nWhen you start out, you think like I\nhave a very very strict separation\nbetween infrastructure and the code\nbecause my infrastructure is, for\nexample, my Kubernetes cluster. It's my\nS3 bucket and my cloud cloudfront uh CDN\nsetup, but the actual website that's\nmanaged by the product team that need to\nbe deployed and rebuilt is decoupled\nfrom it. Right.\n>> Exactly. Exactly.\n>> Exactly. And that's wrong.\n>> What? absolutely wrong because if you're\ndoing um actual DevOps culture two pizza\nteam where you have site reliability\nengineer as part of the product team the\nwhole deployment process belongs to the\nproduct team not to the infrastructure\nteam.\n>> Yeah. Okay. Okay. But there's more to it\nbecause you don't want a product team to\nmanage Kubernetes. But okay.\n>> Why? I mean like sure you don't want\nthem to damage to manage Kubernetes.\nThat's where you as a platform team are\nprovisioning the the the Kubernetes and\nthe integration points like the\nKubernetes endpoint where they need to\ntarget their deployments towards, right?\n>> But we're not talking about Kubernetes\nhere, right? We were talking about an S3\nbucket and the contents of that S3\nbucket or a lambda and the contents of\nthat lambda together with like let's\nimagine that you're you're deploying\nthis API gateway like this magic. I feel\nlike we need another scale about how the\nhow the organ how the organization is\ndone like if it's if it's like team team\ntopology or whatever.\n>> Yes. Because that's what a lot Ben\nIsraeli figured out after he left AWS\nand why AWS CDK works so well in in AWS\nbut doesn't work in other organizations\n>> because\n>> because in AWS they have a two pizza\nteam they have an S sur uh as part of\nthe team. The team is responsible for\nall of the observability for every\npaging alert that happens. It goes to\nthe product team. They are deploying 100\ntimes a days. They get the alerts. They\nhave their their product uh you know\nreliability and their runbooks.\nEverything is managed by the team. But\nin a lot of organizations there's still\na very strict separation where you have\na security team responsible for the IM\nroles and other team responsible for\nother things and that's where team\ntopologies are are are then making it\nobvious.\n>> Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I'm I'm been\nworking with strict separation, you\nknow, separation of duty type outfits\nfor like a decade now. So, I'm pretty\nI'm pretty like\nI don't know how to describe I I I don't\neven know what it's like to be in an\nautonomous team anymore.\n>> Yeah. So, so\n>> it's it's crazy that AWS can do that in\na way considering you know\n>> you know where I like\n>> very nicely and a public artifact of\nthis as an example as part of AWS CDK\nand the the whole CDK ecosystem they\nbuilt this thing called the construct\nhub. So the construct helper if you go\nto constructs.dev\nI think it is is a place that you can\nfind every single construct that was\nbuilt and remember constructs are\nusually you know L2s or L3s built by the\ncommunity. Yeah. Constructs.dev. So\nthese are amazing. Um\nthey are they're like the terapform\nmodule registry but instead they it\ndoesn't cover a niche technology by one\ncompany IBM. um and then pedled by other\ncompanies like Spacelift. Instead, this\nis using registry of .NET, Golang, Java,\nPython, TypeScript and its best-in-class\num you know artifacts or yeah artifactor\num artifact registries. So across all of\nthese so so this construct hub is a\ncomplete public GitHub repository and if\nyou go to that public repository of the\nsource code of the construct hub you see\nthat it's a massive serverless\napplication um basically there's um\nthere's\nwhat is it it's it's a kinesis stream\nsubscription or it's a stream\nsubscription\n>> to npmgs\nuh publish published packages right so\nso if you go to the source\num you can find and the reason this is\npublic is because you can deploy this\nwithin your organization. So it tells\nyou exactly how you can operate this\nwithin your organization. For example,\nyou have your own private registry of\nnpm your own net registry that you don't\nwant to be public and you want to make\nit this construct hub available within\nyour enterprise you can do that and and\nit has documentation with guide books\nexactly what is the alert that's set up\nlike there's a backup bucket uh in in a\nseparate region. So if a region is down,\nall of your registry downloads are still\navailable in a separate region and this\nis how you do a failover and this is how\nyou do that. These docs are amazing. So\nwhen I saw this, I was like now I\nunderstand how a product team can build\nsomething and has like very detailed\nruntime guidelines on on how to observe\nand react to alerts and why that alert\nexists because it creates all of the\nCloudatch alerts. It tells you exactly\nwhy the alert is triggering and how to\nhandle that that instance. So that's on\none side like a two pizza team. You want\nto see a beautiful implementation or a\nproduct delivered by a two pizza team,\nyou look at the construct hub. It's I\nlooked at it, it was amazing.\n>> So I mean these the these people the two\npizza team has to be like super mature\nto take take on all these\nthis uh this responsibility I suppose.\nBut mean but meanwhile most most\ncompanies are designed to to silo\nresponsibility for for lots of good\nreason\n>> because once you start talking about\ncompliance and and those initiatives\nthen now you need to align and you need\nto like do across all of your your teams\nyou need to make sure that the the\ntechnology they are using are are are\nsimilar so that you can push through\nhuge initiatives. you know, you have\nhave one team doing it like this and\nanother team doing it all on on Google\nCloud, you know, it's it's extremely\ndifficult difficult to get like um\ncompliant and I guess like AWS is really\ngood at that as well. Um but most\nenterprise main main you know business\nis not about doing all of that, right? I\nmean AWS is a company providing cloud\nservices and they they are building\ncloud services and they have a great\nteam to build cloud services. So that\nmakes sense.\nMost companies the DevOps um you know\ntype of of of initiatives are\npart of an operational team that is\nshort staffed and that needs uh\nalignment across the teams and centrally\ncontrolled and um and that's where team\ntopologies come in right. So, so which\nso which tooling by that explanation\nwould they gravitate to in your opinion?\nI believe with with things like AWS CDK\nand Construct Hub, you can have a\nplatform team that builds really\npowerful constructs for the rest of the\norganization. constructs that make sure\nthat the the patterns used by the\nproduct teams are supported and can be\neasily integrated within compliance\ninitiatives and and zero trust and all\nthose you know crossorganizational\num effort that you don't want to go\nthrough every team and try to fix them\nup. You want to give them an approved\nand and rubber stamped.\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what happens in my\ncurrent gig right now. We create\nconstructs for for other teams to use.\n>> Yes. And and that requires your platform\nteam not to come from pure operational\nbackground, right? requires your con\nyour platform team to understand how to\ndo object-oriented programming, how to\ndefine an interface, how to integrate\nthat like iterate on that interface, how\nto do you know contracts across teams,\nhow to test against those contract\ncontracts and then you come to an\norganization that's using Terraform\nbecause the old system administrators\nthat like config files never wrote uh\nactual object oriented interface or\nwhatever and then they cannot deal with\nCDK. they cannot deal with like all of\nthese like program.\n>> Yeah. Well, we we tr we uh\n>> I I sound because I'm I'm a bit\nfrustrated because I was in a lot of\nthose things where I try to to introduce\nthis and and I always get like the\nfeedback like you know Terraform is\nsimple why do you make it so complicated\nbut in reality Terraform is not simple\nand one year down the line two years\ndown the line you have Terraform modules\nthat have such a complex interface\nthere's no testing because you have\nnever thought about like actual software\ntesting on your infrastructure as code\nOkay, cool. But you're actually doing\ninfrastructure as\n>> comp. We need and we need to wrap up in\nfive minutes. I need to run out and drop\nmy kids off to school. But like\n>> but just on this point\nuh you you develop constructs for for\nfor um for other people in your\norganization to use, right?\nBut but the trouble is the trouble is is\nthat\num\nlet me just get this clear. Do you\nexpect people to use your constructs via\na config.yaml or do you expect them to\nuse like a a like a Python uh library or\nsomething?\n>> Yeah. So I think there's very different\npersonas. Um, and I think as a platform\nteam, what you should be building\nmaybe exposes a flat interface like a\nYAML, but I don't like YAML. At least it\nshould be JSON schema type YL so that\nthey get an error if they use a field\nthat is not there, right? You can do\nYAML uh\n>> with JSON schema or use most companies\nuse pedantic. Pedantic\n>> pedantic on YAML. I never tried that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> But how does pedantic work? It must must\nhave some type of schema for the data\nstructure behind it.\n>> Yeah. So so basically pedantic if I\nunderstand correctly\nit uh it has its own model. So so the\nthe you the way they use pedantic is\nthat you you read in that YAML and then\nyou compare it against the model and the\nmodel is very powerful. You know you can\nyou can express anything in that model.\n>> Okay. And then the model basically tells\nyou if if it's um yeah how what what all\nthe configs going to be and and if the\nconfig yl is valid and\n>> s so forth and it's used a lot.\n>> Yeah. So what the way I handled like the\nproblem with YAML with it being so\nunstructured is that we use YAML often\nas an input for generating\num well if you put it on top of\nTerraform you can do the Terraform plan\npreview to see how how messed up you did\nwhen you agreed to it.\n>> But it it sounds like such a this whole\nthis whole area with the governor. Okay,\nI do want to bring this back to we I\nguess we can continue but like what what\nwhat of all these technologies that we\nsort of try to map out here badly what\ndo you think AI is going to help any of\nthese problems that we have at the\nmoment like the teams\nthe devx\ndid\n>> so I did a podcast about a year ago\nabout the AI and the infrastructure and\nThey compared it as a new way of doing\nclick ops. Basically, you just have\nthese rampant LLMs just going around\ncreating things across different areas\nwhere you have no idea. So the main\npoint of bringing AI to an organization,\nI think we might have talked about this\nalready was that we need to guide the AI\nwith rules and sandboxes and there's\nseveral organization like several um\ntool tooling suppliers like stackpack\nthat are focused on.\n>> So basically basically we're going to be\nin this area in AI\nWe're we're we're headed to the\ngovernance\nside of things.\n>> Uh yeah, I mean in a way it's like you\nsee what Cloud Skills is doing and and\nnow Kira superpowers. It's all about\ngiving the LLM directions, right? And\nand and right now they're generic, but\nI'm sure a lot of organizations adopting\nAI are are creating internal rules,\nright? They're saying okay uh if you're\nusing cloud use our rules use our skills\ndirectory internally within our\norganization. What kind of rules would\nthere be? Like use\n>> if you want to deploy the integration\npoints for a VPC are in this repository.\nDon't create a VPC for scratch. There's\nan existing one and this is how you find\nthe information about it. Right? Our\ningress is handled through our CDN layer\nand uh we must follow these rules so on\nright like the platform team uh are\nhere. This is the registry where you can\nfind information about the different\nintegration points. as a product team,\nyou're going to have to integrate into\nthe platform team or the cloud.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that that makes\nsense, but I'm just thinking aloud that\num\nhow is this actually governed? So,\nso you have the rules and and you and\nlike say say u a product team. Oh\nI need to go. But okay, we need to pick\nup here. We need to pick up here about\nhow AI is going to work in a typical\norganization. Why did we end up talking\nabout this? Because you asked me about\nCDKTF and I just went on my classic\nrant.\n>> Yeah, we can we can reflect. Okay, I\nI'll catch up with you in a bit. Uh\nprobably tomorrow, right?\n>> Yeah, tomorrow because I in a bit I'll\nalso be on the road.\n>> Okay. So,\n>> okay. Good one. Thanks, Vincent.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:19]\nYou see the little voodoo mask over there where I pray. I do my silent prayers and curse the forces of the day at Hashi Corp. >> Yeah. So that CDKF thing uh got you activated. So did you what did you do after hearing that news? Cuz I thought that project I I was I I think we discussed this project. No one was using it. I mean, or what was my impression? >> Triggered. Triggered. >> Triggered. >> He's pushing buttons, right? This guy woke up fresh. I don't know what I don't know what you want to, you know, get off before we start. >> Okay. So, anyone who's not aware, um, and this is my version of the story, right? My my my side of the story. Um when I woke up on Thursday last week um IBM has decided to sunset CDKTF even though that the week before that they were all there with and um with all the people from AWS and if you don't if you're not aware CDKTF kind of collaboration between AWS and Hashi Corp because CDK is is um is an AWS uh toolkit cloud development toolkit and only really successful for AWS cloud itself with AWS CDK there is some CDK TF for Azure but you know there's bicep and and Google I think they they try to use config um what's it config manager or config connect it's like crossplane or um based kubernetes based um so yeah it was sunset to be honest I have been trying to fork the repository and nobody did anything the repository had not received any love or any updates. It was still pinned to version 1.6 of Terraform and I think they released 1.13 lately. >> Uh most of the features that came to Terraform since 1.7 and I think 1.7 is when the whole BSL fork happened uh I think with 1.8. >> So ever since then >> you might as well go open tofu right at this point. >> Absolutely. So, so the the m so after the sunset event um which was posted on Reddit and hacker news and on LinkedIn uh most of the comments on on Reddit terraform obviously was nobody's using it right uh no let it die right hate those people why would people say that right and and then >> several of course Puli jumped on the opportunity it's like yeah CDKF is like two years younger than Pulumi so Pulumi came out first and it was kind of like a halfbaked effort from Hashi Corp to try and emulate what Palumi provides. I don't think that's really the case. I mean maybe it was >> actually I've not used Palumi in anger so I don't know what to say about it. >> Yeah. So I did a very fun talk at DevOps Day Singapore about how Terraform Hashikorp language is a horrible way for…\n\n[slide:2] [4:59–15:38]\nserverless, you know, AWS CDK is amazing, but you know, try to come to your platform team and say, \"Yes, I know you guys have this amazing Terraform uh pull request previews and and and scanning code and and and all this stuff, but I want to use AWS CDK. I want and then they have to start supporting cloud for uh or even you know more go towards them and say I want to adopt pulley and now they have to think about pulley um into this pipeline. Although that pulley's strong point is that they make um trans migration from Terraformed to their cloud very easy. Obviously they are backed by the original Terraform providers. So they have a lot of migration paths. >> Yeah. I'm just looking at Palumi now. They seem to support every language under the sun >> even YAML. Yeah, you can even put YAML as an input and you get uh you get infrastructure as code. >> So do they do they have tools to to convert the Terraform into into >> language? They have a very powerful I think they can even interact with the terraform back end directly right so you can have them side by side you don't need to migrate everything immediately the only problem is you have to now sign a contract with Palumi and then you have to you know >> so you're so the big problem with Palumi is that it's a commercial non-free thing right >> well when when the BSL announcement came basically when Hashi Corp announced that the source code was uh available but not allowed to be used in competing compar commercial platforms, >> the business license that they put on Terraform. Pulumi made a big announcement how they are the real free version, the real open-source infrastructure as code. So, I can't claim um >> Oh, so so they're open. Okay, hold on. I got to check out the GitHub now. They're open source. >> Yeah. And they um they also another famous pro for Palumi is that SST which is a I think originally SST they are the people that build serverless.tf TF uh serverless not serless.com. >> Yeah. SD, right? >> Yeah. Okay. So, so the source code is Apache 2 licensed. Okay. Okay. >> Yeah. So, >> but I'm guessing they have have a model because I see they see looks like they have like a a cloud UI, right? >> Yeah. So, they're they're like Terraform Cloud, right? They they give you the ability to very quickly get started. Just sign up to their cloud and get your Pulumi code ready. And the terraform cloud is is essentially non-free, right? >> Yeah. They both under management pricing models, right? I think we talked…\n\n[slide:3] [15:17–25:56]\nvideos for noobs like you. >> No, I didn't have to install it. >> Oh, yeah. You're using Omar. You're using uh what's it called? >> Omari. >> Omari. >> Yeah, that's that's how way he pronounce it, right? >> Yeah. But you were sending me screenshots of Hyperland crashing or something, right? >> Yeah. >> That's why I'm on Arch. for the uh crash experiences. I think Arch cannot run this website. Uh cannot run um Xcoly draw. >> What? >> Maybe developer experience goes the other way or I think the same direction. >> What's okay define developer experience. >> Yeah, as a DevOps engineer you should know this. >> Well, >> okay. Basically we are not devops engineer we are platform engineers and one of the things that we should focus on is to provide our developers the tools so that they can take ownership on the services that they built and run in production. >> Okay. Okay. >> And the developer experience comes with um you know the the easiness at which they can define their production workloads. >> Yeah. So my my points of what my point of mental reference is like you know net lefi and u up cell and things like that. >> So essentially what what they need to twiddle with is is a config yaml and uh a CLI tool or something like that and that that's it right that that's that's my point of reference. Of course, so many companies just do it so much more convolutely convolut in a awkward way. Fly.io. >> What did you say you you you called >> Netlfi? Netlfi. >> Yeah. So, they all work in a similar way. There's some CLI and there's some config YAML >> or toml. Maybe I should do a scale for cost like or enterprise adoption or something like that because some of these things like Palumi is going to get expensive. Enterprise I don't know. So, anything I select doesn't show up on my on my browser. I think there's a problem with Chromium to be honest. Um, I'm on a Chromium browser >> on a fork >> and uh and doesn't render properly sometimes. >> So, Palumi is going to be expensive. I think cloudformation terraform is a bit tricky cuz No, I mean Terraform is good because you don't need to pay for rum. No rum. I think you cannot put operational features AWS above terraform or maybe >> I I mean I love it. I love it >> because it's backed by CFN. So you must have the same problems like losing logical um logical ID for resources loses the actual resource ownership. Although they have added a lot of new features to cloud form to help you refactor your code. But yeah, the main reason…\n\n[slide:4] [25:36–36:15]\n>> control >> stability aspects to it. Yeah. Yeah, because you're right. You do a because with IC it's often very close to GitHubs, right? You need to make a source code change, >> bring it to production. >> We're using Terraform to manage some data right now and and uh our basically one of our main guard rails is the plan, but no one reads the plan. No one reads the plan. Like we like we got like a nice GitHub summary to say like, oh, do you know you're recreating resources here? and they just go, \"Yeah, whatever. Apply.\" >> That's weird because like first off, why is it recreating resources? That means that and that's the hard thing about Terraform. >> Well, I I didn't want to mention the I didn't want to mention the provider, but I'm I'm going to mention it. It's not going to incriminate anyone, but this the we've been working with the snow snowflake provider and it just wants to recreate things very easily, but it it's it's it's a complicated environment to be honest. >> Yeah. Some providers have really low quality. >> Yeah. And the snowflake one is in maybe someone has made a video about it, but it's it's it's came out of like I it came out of like the uh the Chan Zuckerberg Foundation or something like this. It's hasn't been maintained very well. Then Snowflake itself eventually adopted it. >> LOL. Oh, that's so funny. I I I used and there's so many experimental features in it, it makes you very nervous. I mean, and then Snowflake is only used by the like the biggest enterprises ever. >> Wow. >> We It's a very It's a very weird setup, but I guess it is it is better than managing it by by hand, I like to think. But still at the end of the day the the provider just seems to do SQL calls or or like it it it lacks so much functionality you're ending up having to write these like what do you call like SQL execute blocks here and there and everywhere which >> yeah so so this is kind of where I feel when I started on my Terraform journey I was like terraform everything right you create an RDS instance you need a database in it well we're going to define the terraform provider for Postgress and we're going to connect it to your RDS instance and we're going to create a database and we're going to create the plug the extensions that need to be active on that database and it's a nightmare because now when you ever you run Terraform you have to have a tunnel to connect to the Postgress instance and you know once you start doing compliance you need you need all…\n\n[slide:5] [35:54–46:34]\nultimately I can't help but think there's no the major differentiator short is going to be is just going to be it's just going to be price isn't it? We you you like if you were like a an enter like a Fortune 500 company, you're not going to use um well, you can't you can't use VEL and and things cuz that's not going to be enough and you're not going to use AW CDK and Terraform is as we know limited. But then you're gonna you're gonna basically pay for Palumi. Okay, this I'm not too sure where I'm going with this. >> Okay, I >> I also wanted to tie this into AI somehow, but it just it look it looks like Palumi is in a very good spot. And we haven't even talk about we haven't even talked about Kubernetes, but I don't want to talk about Kubernetes. Looks like Palumi is is on a I don't know if can can we invest in Palumi? Looks like it's in a really good spot. >> Are you building a tech radar? Maybe I should pull up the some famous tech radar. Um, hold on. Uh, what was I? Ah, AWS CDK. >> Not on the current edition. >> I would give AWS CDK highdevx but very low operational experience. And then SST given it's on on Palumi would be a little bit less on the DevX side because they don't they didn't build all the same like service levels but on the same level as Palumi in terms of operation because it lose uses Palumi under the hood. Yeah. What else is there? Does it make sense? Where are you? I don't see you anymore. >> I'm here. I'm here. I was just looking at um Oh. What the Why does it say data dog? >> What the I >> I was just I was just looking at the uh >> I think you're on this >> the tech radar. The thing the only thing it says on platform to adopt is uh ARM in the cloud. which sounds a bit weird sometimes. I wonder if these people that make those T radars really know what they're talking about. I don't know where which one you're looking at, but like I'm just guessing now. Uh, okay. Let's tie this back to AI. So we we just riffed about how Palumi ST is is in a good spot. We we Oh, we should we should put system initiative somewhere here, right? >> Maybe you can take this this slide back when you talk to Adam from system initiative where you put it. >> I'm not that I'm not that happy here, but like okay, what okay say you're the what do you call it? the chief technology officer of a of a big company that that had a whole bunch of AWS accounts >> only AWS. >> Let's say it's only AWS. Just just to keep the conversation sane. >> Yeah. >> How would you begin…\n\n[slide:6] [46:13–52:13]\nCDK has a built-in asset pipeline and and and part of the things that it bootstrap is all of the necessary supporting um architecture for that asset pipeline it will create an ECR repository so that it you know, so that they can build a Docker image part of the, you know, bundling aspect of your of your application and then deploy that that Docker image in or push that Docker image into the um into ECR the asset registry for Docker images or you know push the bucket maybe which is an ES ES build bundled NodeJS with all of its dependencies and whatever AWS SDK is external needs to be external because that's provided within the runtime. So all of that is taken care of by AWS CDK because it has this beautiful asset pipeline, right? >> Well, I noticed it in one in my workplace that when AWCDK deploys this Fargate pattern or whatever, it's building the Docker image in the same pipeline. And I thought to myself, >> yeah, >> that's not cool. >> It depends. So as soon as the Docker file build fails with some rate limit, then then the whole deployment fails. That's a joke in my opinion. >> Uh to be honest, if you are coming from a developer experience perspective, not being bothered by how exactly your code gets bundled up and and made available to be deployed is kind of a feature that you want and that's why they have it, right? This asset pipeline thing. From looking back when I started with AWS and Terraform, I very strictly said, okay, your code, for example, your website and your bundle, the way that like assets are getting deployed is very disconnected from your infrastructure, right? Classically, >> I'm not so sure I'm a big believer that because because these things, >> it's wrong. What I just said is wrong. When you start out, you think like I have a very very strict separation between infrastructure and the code because my infrastructure is, for example, my Kubernetes cluster. It's my S3 bucket and my cloud cloudfront uh CDN setup, but the actual website that's managed by the product team that need to be deployed and rebuilt is decoupled from it. Right. >> Exactly. Exactly. >> Exactly. And that's wrong. >> What? absolutely wrong because if you're doing um actual DevOps culture two pizza team where you have site reliability engineer as part of the product team the whole deployment process belongs to the product team not to the infrastructure team. >> Yeah.…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This discussion explores the volatile state of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ecosystem following IBM's acquisition of HashiCorp and the subsequent sunsetting of the CDK for Terraform (CDKTF). The speakers analyze the technical and organizational shifts driving developers away from traditional configuration-based tools toward programmatic frameworks like Pulumi and AWS CDK. They examine the trade-offs between developer experience and operational control, the rise of platform engineering, and how modern \"two-pizza teams\" are redefining the boundary between application code and infrastructure.\n\n[slide:1]\n## The Fall of CDKTF and the Rise of Alternatives\nThe conversation begins with the news that IBM decided to sunset CDKTF, a project that was a collaboration between AWS and HashiCorp. The speakers note that the repository had been neglected for some time, remaining pinned to Terraform version 1.6 while the main project advanced to version 1.13. This lack of maintenance occurred despite the project being positioned as a way to bring the benefits of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to the broader Terraform ecosystem. The sunsetting event triggered significant reactions on platforms like Reddit and Hacker News, where many users expressed that the tool was \"half-baked\" or simply not being used. Pulumi is identified as a primary beneficiary of this fallout, having launched years earlier with a more mature programmatic approach to infrastructure. The speakers suggest that for those still tied to the Terraform ecosystem, the move toward OpenTofu is becoming increasingly logical following HashiCorp's shift to the Business Source License (BSL). *Terraform Hashikorp language is a horrible way for developers to manage their infrastructure.* This sentiment reflects a growing frustration with the limitations of HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for product engineers who prefer familiar programming languages.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Pulumi and the Open Source IaC Landscape\nPulumi is highlighted as a strong alternative that supports a wide array of languages, including TypeScript, Python, Go, and even YAML. Unlike HashiCorp's recent licensing changes, Pulumi's source code remains Apache 2 licensed, allowing it to position itself as the \"real\" open-source option for infrastructure. A key advantage of Pulumi is its ability to interact directly with Terraform backends, allowing organizations to run both tools side-by-side during a migration rather than requiring a total rewrite. The speakers also discuss SST (Serverless Stack), which originally built abstractions on top of AWS CDK but has recently pivoted to use Pulumi as its engine. This shift is significant because it moves away from the \"all or nothing\" database-transaction style of CloudFormation, which can often get stuck during rollbacks. Pulumi and Terraform offer more granular control over state refactoring, which is essential for large-scale enterprise environments. While Pulumi offers a free open-source tier, its commercial model involves a managed cloud UI for state and orchestration, similar to Terraform Cloud.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Defining Developer Experience in Platform Engineering\nThe speakers attempt to map various tools on a scale of Developer Experience (DevX) versus operational features. They define the role of a platform engineer as providing tools that allow developers to take full ownership of their services in production. High-DevX tools like Vercel, Netlify, and Fly.io are praised for their simplicity, often requiring only a CLI and a basic configuration file. However, these tools often lack the \"operational depth\" required for complex infrastructure, such as fine-grained control over database bootstrapping or networking. AWS CDK is placed high on the DevX scale but lower on operational flexibility because it is backed by CloudFormation, which can lose track of resources if logical IDs change. The speakers argue that a good developer experience is not just about ease of use, but about the \"agility\" it provides to a team. They note that many organizations struggle with \"click-ops,\" where developers manually configure resources in the AWS console because the IaC tools are too convoluted to use effectively.\n\n[slide:4]\n## The Complexity of Low-Level Resource Management\nA major criticism of Terraform is that it forces developers to manage every single low-level API resource, such as IAM roles, trust policies, and security group rules, just to connect a simple Lambda function to an API Gateway. This \"low-level\" perspective is a barrier for product engineers who want to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure plumbing. The speakers discuss the varying quality of Terraform providers, citing the Snowflake provider as an example of a tool that can be \"experimental\" and prone to recreating resources unexpectedly. They describe the \"nightmare\" of trying to manage everything through Terraform, such as running SQL queries to configure database extensions, which requires complex networking tunnels and security compliance measures. Some argue that IaC should be reserved for stable, long-lived resources like databases, while more dynamic application components should be handled by higher-level abstractions. The lack of automated testing in many Terraform setups further complicates long-term maintenance, leading to \"complex interfaces\" that are difficult to refactor after a year or two of development.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Strategic Infrastructure Mapping for the Enterprise\nWhen considering how a CTO should manage hundreds of AWS accounts, the speakers weigh the benefits of Pulumi, SST, and AWS CDK. Pulumi is noted for its \"on-event\" hooks, which allow for dynamic logic during deployment—such as automatically adjusting configurations based on the number of availability zones in a specific region. This is contrasted with Terraform's deterministic, static nature. AWS CDK uses \"context providers\" to achieve a similar effect, querying the environment during the synthesis phase and storing the results in a `cdk.context.json` file to ensure builds remain deterministic when checked into version control. The speakers discuss the \"Two-Pizza Team\" model used at AWS, where the team responsible for the product also handles observability, paging alerts, and reliability. In this model, the separation between \"infrastructure\" and \"code\" disappears. For organizations with strict silos—where security teams own IAM and networking teams own VPCs—adopting these integrated programmatic tools can be challenging, as they require a platform team that understands object-oriented programming and software testing rather than just system administration.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Integrated Deployments and the Construct Hub\nThe final segment focuses on the \"Construct Hub,\" a registry for AWS CDK, CDKTF, and Projen constructs that allows teams to share high-level integration patterns. Unlike the Terraform Module Registry, which is often limited to HCL, the Construct Hub supports multiple programming languages and leverages native package managers like NPM and PyPI. The speakers highlight the \"Construct Hub\" itself as a prime example of a mature serverless application built by a two-pizza team, featuring automated failovers and detailed runbooks. They argue that the traditional separation of infrastructure and application code is fundamentally \"wrong\" for modern DevOps. *The whole deployment process belongs to the product team not to the infrastructure team.* This integrated approach is facilitated by the AWS CDK asset pipeline, which bundles application code (like Docker images or Lambda zip files) directly with the infrastructure definition. While some criticize this for making deployments dependent on local build environments or rate limits, the speakers view it as a vital feature for developer autonomy. The discussion concludes with a look toward the future, where AI might assist in governing these complex environments by guiding LLMs with organizational rules and \"sandboxes\" to prevent rampant, unmanaged resource creation."
