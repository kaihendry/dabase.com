    "content": "Transcript:\nYo, how was your trip yesterday?\n>> It was pretty epic. There was a huge\nstorm in the UK actually and I'm and I\npretty much drove well, not through it,\nbut like I stopped off at my sisters and\nthen I and then when it passed, I drove\nafter it. So, I got to see the beginning\nof it and the and the after of it. So,\nit was a pretty epic storm.\n>> Have you seen that kite surfing video?\n[clears throat] There was like\n>> in Israel\n>> during a storm\n>> there was like a thermal vortex like a\nlittle cyclone and some kite surfers got\ncaught into it and one guy he went like\nsuper high but he was able to eject when\nhe was lowered to the ground. The other\nguy he got dragged onto rocks and died.\nSo it was um it's been posted like four\nor five times on Reddit. Maybe because I\nlike to kite surfer so I see it.\n>> It's pretty bad. But yeah, you're\ntalking about the storm reminded me.\nSorry you were saying after the storm.\nUh but I mean to be honest we were not\nimpacted. But one thing that makes me\nnervous is that um I think last year was\nit the year before we had a storm durag\nand we were out of power for like two 47\nhours. Is that two days almost?\nAnd it was pretty terrible because\nwithout power we cannot actually power\nour oil\nor gas heating systems.\n>> Basically [snorts]\nIt really goes to hell here very\nquickly. And uh and funny and the other\nthing that really irritates me is that\nlike as a South African if I'm actually\nused to the power to go to go out but\nthe infrastructure the mobile\ninfrastructure it always has like a huge\nbackup. Your audio just switched\n>> from what to what?\n>> I don't know the audio. Maybe when you\nwhen you moved closer. Maybe it's it's\n>> Oh, you know what? I think I I knocked\nout the bloody\nuh RX or something.\n>> Yeah. Test.\n>> No, when you said that about um you\ncouldn't turn on your electric like\ncooking or or anything. When I wanted I\ncame to Vietnam, I I really hated those\ngas cookers.\n>> Oh, yeah. But now you love them.\n>> And and the fire. I don't like it\nbecause I see videos of these gas\ncanisters exploding and things like\nthat. And I was begging my um my wife to\nget like um an electric cooker and she's\nlike, \"No way.\" You know, there's going\nto be a power outage and we can't cook.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. [snorts] So we\nhave we have like a little Korean set\nand those little butane canisters for\nfor for these occasions.\n>> But yeah, going back to the the\ninfrastructure cuz this is the AI\ninfrastructure podcast.\n>> Yeah.\n>> In South Africa, the infrastructure is\nvery robust.\nBut when the power goes out here in uh\nyou know 5 minutes later my 4G signal\ndisappears and then\n>> really and yeah like none of the none of\nthe masts in England have backup power.\nMaybe they do it out in like London, but\naround here in the southwest, none have\nbackup power. [snorts]\n>> You weren't afraid it was going to be\nlike like a Venezuela incident. They\ntake out the the power in the city and\nnext thing you know, your prime minister\nis on a plane back to the US.\n>> Well, yeah. Well, the resiliency factor\nin in UK and I do think it's related to\nthe well to the mobile infrastructure is\nis very poor actually. So if the if any\nRussians are listening to this\n>> Yeah.\n>> now you know\n>> but I know they take London in in u\nwhat's this movie with um Edge with Tom\nCruz\nuh where he brings tomorrow.\n>> Yeah, tomorrow's edge. [gasps]\n>> They take London very quickly as soon as\nthe the beach uh battle was lost.\n[laughter]\n>> Tomorrow's I watched the movie like four\nor five times. I know it's maybe because\nyou like and you like games. Anyway,\n>> the Anyway,\n>> one of the things I wanted to that was\njust banging around my head after being\nat on on site\num the last couple of days was that\non on one on one side I have you know\nsince I'm a middle manager I don't know\nhow you feel you are in in the industry\nbut I mean I do feel like I'm a very\nhands-on middle manager but nonetheless\nI'm a middle manager since I'm my middle\nmanager. I have I have the the executive\nsort of asking me, \"Hey, Kai, um how's\nthis AI thing going? Um it makes people\nmore productive, right? It it's how much\nmore productive 100 100% 200% how can\nyou just tell can you build a case study\nfor me to show how how more productive\nyou are with AI?\" And this is in that\nsaid and the AI roller in this\nparticular customer is incredibly\nfrustrating and bad because they disable\nuh all the good models. So that I got on\none hand I've got the these sort of\nquestions and then and then for the sort\nof the colleagues sort of um that I work\nwith\nmany of them are actually um quite\nnervous about the future and um okay I'm\nexaggerating here when they when they\nwhen I think in my in the in the notes I\ncall them doomers but like a lot of\npeople say like are basically like uh\nsaying to me that like oh um AI isn't\ngoing to make me um you know twice as\neffective. And it's absolute [ __ ]\nthat management are are coming up with\nthese things as an excuse to uh reorg\nand lay off people. But that's the way\nthey feel and and and and\nI'm in the middle and I don't know and\nmy feeling is is is just trying to be\nwell I am a positive I like to think I'm\na positive person. Some some people\nmight disagree with with with that\nsentiment, but like I'm very excited\nabout the future. I am so excited, but\nat the same time, like I can't really\nlike my my fun factor that we have in\nour little podcast chats, I does that\ntranslate to a 200% productivity? I I I\nI am reluctant to say that. and and at\nthe same time I'm like how do I make how\ndo I make people more positive who are\naround me or or you know\n>> report to me you know what I mean\n>> okay let's because you touched on like\nfive different points I think the first\none you mentioned is how do you me\nmeasure productivity and that's all\nabout the devops accelerate report right\ndora metrics how many times do you\ndeploy how long product feature to go to\nproduction\n>> let's be real a lot of these dora\nmetrics aren't aren't extremely well\nrecorded and and things like that and\nthey're very hard to\n>> No, no, there are so we implemented the\nDora metrics well me uh a a colleague of\nmine implemented the Dora metrics as a\nprevious company and you you have four\nclear metrics that are well defined of\nwhat you need to measure and they are\nthe key I can argue with you but carry\non\n>> and like meantime between failure is is\noften something that's quite contentious\nI\nIt's you're the matter is you need to\nmeasure where you are and then measure\nthe improvements, right? So it's about\ntaking snapshots. It's about agreeing.\nYeah, sure.\nThey identified these are the metrics\nthat correlate to productive um\ncompanies or companies that are\nsuccessful according to the research\nthat they've been doing sponsored by\nGoogle over several years looking at\nmany different companies and across\ndifferent industries and different\nstyles of companies maturity and all and\nthey said look those four metrics start\nmeasuring them. So then this the fact is\nsource of truth. Where do I get this\ninformation? How exactly do I measure\nthat for this particular team for this\nparticular product, right? Um where does\nthe the you know how long does it take\nfor a feature to be from specified down\nto production and and how do I measure\nthat you know do I go to GitHub? Is\nthere like a certain Jira ticket\nattached to the pull request and can I\nsee when the when the Jira is you know\nprogressing along the different stages\nand when the is the mer is a branch\nmerged and the release tech and so on\nright so that was the exercise really at\nmy previous company that um a part of\nthe team did and they started having\nsnapshots for every team the data team\nthe cloud team the app team you know the\niPad app team\n>> snapshots by team yeah\n>> yeah and then they start showing okay\nthis team's quite well on the way on the\non their on their journey uh after one\nmonth two months uh improvements and so\non. So then I think if you started doing\nthose snapshots early before the AI\nadoption you can definitely you know\ncompare this team has heavily\n>> I mean I wish I wish it was that easy\nbut maybe I'm just being making coming\nup with excuses but like\n>> yeah it really comes down to just doing\nlike breaking it down in small steps and\ndoing it. I hate I have some colleagues\nthat are constantly going about what if\nyes we have to understand the problem so\nwe can well define the solution but at\nthe same time if we spend days arguing\nback and forth about what is that of how\nit really works until like put it then\nyou know spin up I'm very quick to spin\nup a docker compos cluster with the\ndifferent uh you know like the engineext\nand whatever like this was particularly\nabout rate limiting or or about shared\nmemory right using a swap\n>> rate limiting I I I worked on an enginex\nrate limiting uh uh module back a couple\nof gigs ago.\n>> Yeah,\n>> we should.\n>> So, the thing is I hate I hate these\nvery theoretical like I want a a very\nearly MVP definition. What do we need to\ndo to to prove some of this? And that's\nwhat the guy in in in in that comp in\nthe company I worked for did. He went\nwith like a pre-prepared\nuh solution like pop flash or pop dog\nsomething. It's not pop dog because\nthat's the train in in in in\nCounterstrike. [laughter]\nuh with it's like pop up. So something\nlike that. Anyway,\n>> but like okay I\n>> was a very clear path very didn't take\nlong took quick. Okay, you're talking\nabout making some stone cold\nmeasurements and you're right. You're\nabsolutely right.\n>> But I had a second point and and I think\nthat the objective, but like how do you\ndeal with people's, you know, vibes, you\nknow, that's\n>> Yeah. So people second thing, right?\nFirst thing is the metrics because this\nis the same problem that we always face\nas a platform team where we're not\ndirectly um valued against the business\nand we need to our metrics really come\ndown to the Dora metrics, right? we need\nto optimize for those and we need to\nprove that our efforts and our projects\noptimize those metrics. So that's how\nyou can attach value to a platform team\naside from constantly asking them to to\n>> So have you honestly had success? So\nthis is how you've defended your DevOps\nuh work in the past by saying like uh\nyou know hey we are delivering uh faster\nthanks to my work. I mean or you or you\njust playing this by the book?\n>> No. Um\n>> do you have a real case study?\n>> Yeah, but I found so the team that I was\nin was doing this. I think I stayed for\n6 months and then I left. [laughter] Um\nbecause I wanted I thought there was\nfundamentally something wrong with the\nway that the platform was was being\ndeveloped and I wanted instead of\nconstantly being forced to go and you\nknow do little bandates on the different\nteams infrastructure I wanted to have a\nproper design but I've also learned that\nthat is not really something um but\nanyway so I've seen they because there\nwas a very strong culture of sharing\nresults in that company so there was\nalways this big all all hands-on\nmeetings where every team presented the\nresults. So, the team presented those\ndashboards, but I did think a lot of\nthose numbers were being fudged for\nexample.\n>> Oh, yeah, of course. Oh my god. I was\nThat's what I was going to say. I mean,\nif if you have a culture of doing line\ngraphs, it's going to be so bad.\n>> Yeah. No, but also like there was this\ninitiative to to increase the AWS\nresource tagging and one approach was to\nadd tags and tax policies around the\ninfrastructure as code so that they are\nbeing measured and pull requests are\nbeing uh blocked until tag tag coverage\nimproves and so on until beatings will\ncontinue until the memorial improves.\n[laughter] Anyway, um but in those cases\n>> will continue. I've never heard that one\nbut it's quite hilarious. It's I think\nit's from Montipython not uh you know um\nyeah\n>> will continue until the moral improves.\nYeah. So [laughter] but in this case\nthey actually went through manually and\nadded tags all over the place and it was\njustified because some of the resources\nwere not under IC. But to be honest I\nthink it was just a a hack because they\nwere under IC and you just had to go put\nit just to present the report like yeah\nwe improved tech coverage from 20% to\n60%. like, \"Okay, fuck.\"\n>> I hate sitting in these meetings because\nI'm just like thinking, \"Oh my god, this\nis bullshit.\" But if I say something,\nthen everyone's going to think I'm the\nbiggest [ __ ] in the room.\n>> Yeah, I do say some things. But I've\nlearned to say those things not in\npublic channels anymore. [laughter]\n>> But I go [snorts] to people, I say like\nthat's not right. You just added the\ntags manually.\n>> Private meetings will resume.\n[laughter] So, but then the second part\nyou touched on is about the human aspect\nlike because yes sure you can measure a\nteam per team and you can measure those\nmetrics but this is something that Jean\nKim and Steve Jagger touched on in their\ntalk right when they said like they had\na problem in OpenAI um in where how can\nyou compare somebody that has fully\nadopted LLM versus someone who hasn't\nbecause if they looked at at the\ntraditional metrics someone who has\nadopted AI is doing a lot better and and\nso\n>> well they say that and they don't really\ntell you\n>> because they sell it also, right?\n>> Yeah. And this is the this is the\nfrustrating thing is like, oh yeah,\nthey're much better. They're 10 times 10\ntimes engineer, but like uh okay, how do\nyou\n>> that's just the 10x engineer is like a\nis is a meme, isn't it? It's just means\nthat that that they're\n>> a red flag. Once I was interview I was\ninterviewed for a company and I I I\npassed and they offered me and I I\nwasn't really accepting the offer and\nthen they called me in and and then the\nthey called in like the CTO or CEO and\nhe came in I heard you're like a\n>> ax 10x engineer\n>> or or what do you call a hero or\nsomething like that and the moment I\nhear that word and then the other\nexamples was like you know our\noriginally founders they rewrote the\nwhole thing in in three nights of Red\nBull Uh, and I'm like, \"Yeah, no, no,\nI'm not joining your company.\"\n[laughter] If that's what you um, you\nknow, think is a good like work life\nbalance. Um, that's not the\n>> living in you are living in Asia. Work\nlife balance.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. That was\n>> Here we are talking about work on on a\nSaturday morning. Work life balance.\n>> I'm not talking about work. I'm ranting.\n[laughter]\n>> This is my my my exhaust. My\n>> this is my therapy. No, but like um\nyou're right with Jean then and um maybe\nthey are selling these they are selling\nAI and they're selling um this. So where\nare the actual measurements? I don't\nknow. Maybe they were referring\nsomething that's publicly available and\nI haven't read it. I just took them for\ntheir word. So\n>> Oh yeah. I mean also that that anthropic\nthing I think we discussed that earlier.\nI mean\n>> the report the that report that was made\nby a\n>> Oh yeah\n>> there was this entropic report and and\nit was like we asked cloud to estimate\nthe task and then it finished it in 10%\nof the time. We asked cloud to analyze\nall of its work and it and it estimated\nthat it finished it all in 10% of the\ntime. It's like yeah well [laughter]\n>> I guess the next thing I'm going to do\nis ask ask Gemini or Claude how to u\nmeasure the productivity gains. And of\ncourse it does feel completely wrong to\ndo it that way.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I I mean\n>> unless unless it can it can surface\nhard. I'm inclined to to just pull it\nback to vibes, you know, like so I was\nasked to give a pres internal\npresentation about the the gains of AI\nand um I'm thinking of just just uh\nturning turning the talk into something\nlike how people are happier.\nuh which might not go down well and I\nmight get\nbut I think I think that's the key thing\nfor me. I'm actually just genuinely\nhappier because I can now deliver faster\nand better work.\nYou know what a team lead of me in the\npast, he used to do the standup uh you\nknow every weekly sync up or I think it\nwas weekly and he would ask the mood\nlike happy sad every time for every\nevery member to measure it.\n>> Yeah. As part of the standup like you\nknow what did you you but it wasn't\nstandup maybe it was like the weekly uh\ncheck-in or something like that. But but\nteam white everyone\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But that's that's a typical\nthing you do in a retro for example, you\nknow. Yeah, you have safety check.\n>> If you have [clears throat] if you have\n>> if you have recorded it then you can say\nwell since we rolled out cloud code\nplans to everyone happiness has gone up.\n>> Yeah but\n>> anxiousness has gone up too. [laughter]\nWell, it's a difficult it's difficult to\nmeasure that too because ultimately\n>> I mean like personally\nI I I can be maybe it's the my Germanic\nblood but like I wake up in the morning\nand I'm not freaking happy dude\n>> and then people hey happy new year how's\nit going like like please\n>> like yeah sure\n>> cloud deployed all of my features that I\nI estimated for two weeks of work in\njust 3 days but at the same time the\ntoilet on the second level is broken.\nIt's like [laughter]\n>> Yeah. Oh, actually that that reminds me\nmy particular client the the office has\nso many like problems.\nBut I do think overall I think after the\nChristmas period, New Year period, the\nsentiment and the way people talk about\nAI has significantly changed.\nPeople are more like declaring that they\ndon't look at their code.\n>> Yeah. more\n>> that video. I mean, you linked it to me.\nI can't believe he was right.\n>> Yes. From\n>> that Theo video. I to be honest, I find\nTheo a little bit irritating to watch\nfor some reason. But like I did\n>> I always complain, but I always watch\nhis videos.\n>> Yeah, I did watch his video and I\nthought he I thought he was absolutely\nspot on. I even I even uh\n>> You're good.\n>> I even tweeted. Yeah. So,\nI don't know. Maybe it's his hair. But\nanyway, the\n>> it's just a side comments of like but I\nI felt maybe I got used to them or I\nfeel there's less. He was very much\nfrustrated that Antropic was not giving\nhim anything and he was very much saying\nOpenAI is doing a great job but maybe\nbecause it more aligns with me now.\nMaybe it's my little bubble and it fits\nin my bubble better. I was like, \"Oh,\nhe's he's hailing on Tropic now. I like\nto watch his videos.\" [laughter] But but\nI still feel like\num perhaps I need to rewatch the video,\nbut like um\nyeah, there was that that that\n[clears throat] whole spiel about not\nnot looking at the code anymore. But I\nstill feel like people\nI felt like he said it well maybe I'm\njust daydreaming at the moment but like\nI still there's still a lot of people\nwho somehow throw in a weird argument\nthat like I'm not looking at my code but\nat the same time I still I do look at I\ndo look at it just to make sure it's\nit's producing good code like so what is\nit? Are you looking or you're not\nlooking? You know, but I mean are are\nyou like what do you mean by I'm not\nlooking? You know, this is I feel like\npeople are not being super honest about\nit.\n>> I think it's a it's um it's a it's a\nslope. How do you say it's like a a\nrange of of looking at code? I'm looking\nat code.\n>> I'm not looking uh\n>> it's a range. Yes. I'm looking like at\nevery line or I'm looking at the\nfunctions or I'm looking at the file\nstructures or I'm looking at the you\nknow architecture high level um you know\ncleanliness of of of it perhaps um but\nI had something else I wanted to say and\nnow it's gone oh no that the other I\nthought you were going with that\nsentence like I'm not looking at the\ncode but it's and then they say it's the\nmost well- tested and validated code\nthat I have ever delivered in my life\nand and a lot of people say that like\nI've never spend so much like effort on\nunit tests because and I think this is\ntrue because with the AI the unit tests\nare so effective now the moment the AI\ndoesn't like write proper code in like\ncreates a small bug it gets an immediate\nfeedback immediately says like hey that\njust broke it's like oh I forgot about\nthat and it fixes it and I think that's\ntrue I think it and we and we discussed\nabout this for the last three podcasts\nand I hope I've convinced you a little\nbit but um but these\n>> I'm still a little bit dubious about\neven than that because in the last video\nif you remember we we we observed that\nthe beads uh\n>> no but failing we don't talk about beats\n>> we don't we don't talk about beats here\nI mean as as a we we talk about it as a\nmemory system not as a well tested\narchitecture because I told you in the\nvery early on I am very scared of\nupdating beats because I was just\nlooking at the change logs on the\nreleases and it was like fixing\nmerge conflict that corrupted all of\nyour issue task list I was like all the\nI don't want to upgrade to [laughter]\n[gasps] you know\n>> I think I think DAX and open code were\nwere extoring their tests but I haven't\nlooked at open code GitHub\nokay so I think so just let me talk\nabout\n>> just to summarize our last chat\n[snorts]\n>> if you want to talk about the test part\nbecause you just sent me the video of um\nspecdriven development from AI engineer\nthat was filmed. I looked at the date,\nNovember 22, uh, from one of the\nengineers that works on Kirro, the AWS\nspecdriven development IDE, and it was\nvery interesting because he dives into\nexactly where do they trust or put LLM\nflows and I know they because they do\nproperty based testing and if you use\nNodeJS, you can do that with fact check\nor fast check. Sorry, fast check.\n>> Yeah. Or hypothesis.\n>> Hypothesis in Python he mentions. Yes.\n>> So, I'm actually not very familiar with\nthis. This is so you do you know what\nare you talking about then?\n>> So because I was porting AWS CDK to\nCDKTF for Terraform um or CDK for\nTerraform there's several\num scenarios where they use property\nbased testing in their testing harness\nthat I also ported over. I think it was\nin um the way that you define schedules\num for like scheduled rules or scheduled\nthings like if you if you if you do\ncloudatch and you want to define a\nschedule and you have different\nconstraints they do property based\ntesting in that part of the code and I I\nnever used it before and I was like what\nis all this because then I have to I\nhave to install a fast check and I have\nto learn how that works and and usually\nI spend a lot of time trying to\nunderstand how the tool works. and how\nthe property based testing works. But in\nthis case, the moment I installed it and\nI copied over the to the the tests and\nthen I could verify that my uh Terraform\nbecause it wasn't really testing\nTerraform or cloud formation. It was\nreally testing the functionality of\ndefining a scheduled rule. So fast check\nreally cool. It was really nice to see\nit run and I'm very excited. Um\n>> okay. And so the fast check is a snap uh\nsorry\n>> is a NodeJS property based testing\nframework. Okay,\n>> I need to Okay, I want to see these\ntests run in open code and I'm just\nstruggling to\njust find out how they release.\nOkay, how like I hate it when there's no\nmake file.\nHow do you do that? So one of the things\nthat they highlighted uh in the in the\nspecdriven development setup of Kirao is\nthey use procedural or like algorithm um\ndeterministic logic um to set up the\ntesting and the validation. So they\nforce you early on to define ears\nformatted tests. So uh sorry um user\nrequirements and user stories\n>> like cucumber type stuff or what are you\ntalking Yeah, behavior driven kind of\nlike\nas a user when I do this I expect this\nor something like that. So that they are\nvery strict in the in the way that they\nwant want the LLM to generate these and\nthey do a lot of like structural tests\nagainst those because they evaluate that\nand they generate property based testing\nout of those markdown. So that's super\ninteresting, right? Because now you're\nno longer asking an LLM to transcribe\nthe user story into some type of\ntesting. you're actually fundamentally\nvalidating\num whatever the user and the LLM has\ncome to after you know brainstorming and\nI think LLMs are great at that um help\nus you know expand our horizon and think\nand um and then really structurally\nvalidate it and generate proper tests\nabout it u which you can trust so that\nwas a very nice uh aspect on it and then\nthe second part that he highlighted was\num in\n>> I got to see this I mean do can you show\nme these\nSorry, my brain is\nnot really working. So, do you have\nmaybe you can steal the screen share and\nand show me these property based tests?\nDo you have anything to add?\n>> I didn't I don't he didn't show them in\nthe video. Um I would need to install\nKira and figure out where\n>> Oh my god. So, we we're talking about\nit. We don't need we\n>> no because we are asking the question um\nhow can you trust the test that the LLM\nis writing and the way that K is solving\nit is by you know putting a lot of\nformal mechanisms around it and that's\nvery exciting\n>> this before I've never seen this before\n>> yeah yeah blacksmith runs on um\ndepot.deb I'm actually investigating\nthat because I'm forking the Terraform\nCDK and the biggest concern is the cost\nof the runners because some of those uh\nTypeScript um programs require eight\nCPUs and 32 GB of memory when they are\nrunning.\nSo I need to find a good uh GitHub\nhosted runner alternative.\n>> Okay. Do you use bun by the way? Cuz I\nnoticed Bun got bored.\n>> Everyone's using bun now. Yeah, Antropic\nacquired it. But like I'm struggling to\nrun this test here.\n>> This is bun turbo type check.\n>> Turbo is turbo repo.\n>> Type check is just a package of JSON. So\nturbo is a way to run uh tasks across\nyour monor repo and and with a cache. So\nit will look at the input sha and then\nif if the input sh didn't change it will\njust use the cached result so it can\nspeed up your task. So turbo is just\ngoing to run type check as a package of\nJSON script.\n>> Okay. Type check is just going to run\nTSC and usually type check is just\nrunning the TypeScript compiler. It's\nnot really\n>> I can't work out how to run uh open code\ntests.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. Okay. If I can't work out maybe\nlet's have a look at the the GitHub at\nleast. Um Oh, sorry. I'm not sharing the\nscreen here.\nI'm just I'm I'm\njust\n>> There are a lot of good things from the\nvideo you shared me.\n>> Oh, cool cool. But I need I'm a I'm a\nvisual learner. I need to see the bloody\ntest. I need I need to see the test. I\nneed to see it running.\nI need to see the test failing. I need\nto build\n>> trust with the the test has value. You\nknow what I mean? It's like [snorts]\n>> this is a journey. I maybe it's not\nworth talking about now. I I kind of\nwant to turn the conversation back to um\nOh yeah. Like one thing that was very\ngood that\n>> Yeah. from\n>> from Theo's video is the Jven's paradox\nwhich was actually mentioned by Simon\nWillis\n>> and I'm also a huge fan of Simon Willis.\n>> Uh if you don't subscribe to him then\nyou're missing out. I really love his uh\nhis tool to um share uh so so this post\nI wrote here is like I I use his UVX his\nclaude code transcripts into\n>> there's another tool I wanted to show\nyou as well but\n>> to pick out the session and then we sort\nof share it as a team. So I think this\nis like\n>> this is like level one.\n>> Yeah, this is very very level one. But\nbut but that's where we are at my\nworkplace. It's like it's like you know\nthe uh the different stakeholders and\nthe people are are basically in a\nbrowser copy and pasting between that\nand VS Code because the VS Code\norganization is so locked down. Uh\nanyway, so yeah paradox. Uh yeah, I'm\ntrying to get people I mean this is a\nnew argument for me and I I I'm I'm I'm\nI believe it. I'm I'm behind it. It's\nlike if things are getting easier to do,\nwe're going to do more of it, not less\nof it. I mean, I'm I'm I mean, I think\nit's all public stuff. I have a I have a\nguy that I I think I used to work with\nhim you um he was sort of posting some\nlike doomer stuff like it's like when\nAGA comes along then prime real estate\nis going to collapse and then I then I\nasked him like why do you think that and\nhe says like with with heavy uh AGI job\ndisplacement that uh people will become\non lower incomes and then people just\nwon't be able to to meet rent I think is\nwhat he was trying to say and then\nthere'll be like a a spiral down where\neverything sort of collapses\nand then I do mention Jven's paradox in\nthat in that Twitter thread\nand then he comes back by saying that's\nreason by analogy. Analogy will break at\nthe limit.\nIt will hold for some time.\num as long as we're not bottlenecked by\nenergy supply. Uh you know, oh god. Um\nbut but with the cost of intelligence\nlabor approaching zero,\n>> there'd be very few demands that supply\ncannot meet. Lower incomes coupled with\nlower prices would would would produce a\ndeflationary\ncycle like unlike any we've ever seen.\nUm and then then he quotes\nuh this some I don't know where he gets\nit exactly. We're going to hell before\neveryone goes to heaven. I mean I get\nthat but at the same time I don't want\nto get behind it. I I don't want to\nthink that's going to happen. I\nI mean his def his his com his\ncombativeness\nof like that Jven's paradox is going to\nsomehow break at the limit. I\nh I don't think I I don't think so.\nI mean I I don't want to think so\nbut um yeah regarding the the the the\nfact that originally I always feel that\nwe are heavily subsidized they are\nspending so much money and we are spend\nwe are actually using a lot more quote\nthan our quotas unless you're using API\nkeys which is dumb. Yeah, I mean I I\nthink things could get a bit more\nrestrictive in future. Like we're\ndefinitely since since we're the\nastronauts of of the AI, we we're\ngetting a free ride in some ways.\n>> Yeah. Which to me feels like it's going\nto become this elitists. Um only few\npeople can afford I think it's already a\nlittle bit the case, right? There's only\na few people that are spending $600 a\nmonth on three cloud max\nplans and those guys are like, you know,\noutputting. so much um that it's is if\nlike\n>> yeah like Steve Jger is like elevated.\n>> Yeah, he was he was he was very elevated\nbefore with this stuff.\n>> Yeah, I wanted to share something that I\nsaid I would I would share a couple of\ntools that are really cool. Um I want to\nshare my screen. Yeah.\n>> Well, actually I'm not too sure about\nthis.\n>> Can you see my screen?\n>> Yep.\nAll right. So, you see here at the top I\nhave this little little bar that shows\nlike my codecs. I've not used much right\nnow. And I'm\n>> Is that Is that a Is that an official\nCodeex thing or is it some\n>> No, it has Cloud here. Oh, so stupid. 5\nseconds ago, Cloud was right there. But\nI guess it I ran it on on uh another\none.\n>> I'm not I'm not a huge fan of menu bars.\nI always feel like they're just sucking\npower. But [snorts] you find this one\nuseful.\n>> Well, what did you\n>> for me from what I do right now? Because\nyou kept asking how do you keep track of\nthe context and how do you keep track of\nthe usage? But I I don't care so much\nabout context because you get a warning\nabout 30% in. So I'm like, okay, that's\nwhen I kill the session.\n>> I probably have to cut this out. You I\nthink you you accidentally shared\nsomeone's name there.\n>> Where?\n>> On the bottom left is a this\n>> Oh, this one.\n>> Yeah. No, he it's a book for about um AI\nchanges tools, but you still owe the\ncraft. I like that that uh page.\n>> Okay. I'm just a bit nervous about\nhaving to edit this video.\n>> It's not a CV or anything. It's a book.\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> Um so I think you'll be happy book.\n>> Oh, that's the author, I guess. Okay.\n>> Yeah, he's the author and he works at\nshopback in Singapore and he's kind of\nas an evangelist talking a lot about the\ntools because he's introducing them. I\nthink he's bit of an engineer.\n>> So, is he is he bumping up AI? Ah, well,\nthis is the kind of\n>> I don't know how how how we should\nreason about it. Yeah. But the fact is\nget back to\n>> maybe share that with me if it's if it's\ngood cuz I need the reason it's open on\nmy on my laptop is I still haven't read\nit.\n>> All right. Right. But but just just just\nto summarize where I am, Vincent, I need\nto\n>> to basically um become an AI mascot in\nmy company without\n>> Yeah, these are definitely the recovery\ncodes you should cut out.\n>> [laughter]\n>> Thanks.\nUh, okay. Hold it. Do I I need to really\ncut that out. Okay, let me just make a\nso I can find it. Cut.\n>> Your name escort. You can start from\nthere.\n>> Okay. What were you showing me? What\nwere you showing me? You showing me\n>> Hold on.\n>> Oh, you were showing me this like\ncodeex. uh you're showing me this menu\nbar thing\nyou're you're flexing to the the podcast\nlisteners or pe the viewers like yeah\nI've got I'm burnt I'm burnt through a\nbillion tokens in the last 24 hours\nstuff that you wouldn't couldn't afford\nor you couldn't get through your company\nno that's where we were we were talking\nabout how it's like an elitist right but\nthat made me realize I have this little\nbar here at the top that shows you how\nmuch codeex how cloud and then how much\nGemini I've used so far.\n>> How much of the Earth you've destroyed?\n>> Yeah, that's So people are doing these\nInstagram\n>> $500.\n>> No,\n>> that's API calls for sure because I only\npay $20 a month. So So just to show that\nif you pay API calls, it's a bit silly\nbecause they cost a lot of money. But if\nyou use something like um a $20\nsubscription, you get that in mind.\nBut still actually these these\n>> but this is this is this is wrong\nbecause this is probably because I\nhaven't spent extra usage 500\n>> as a consultant\npeople people it's it's sometimes eye\nwatering but it's not unusual to see\npeople being build you know thousand\n$1,000 US a day right for a consultant\nand and then and then I at the same time\nI get a bit you know I I shout out when\nI see someone that has spent $600 on\nClaude in a month. Of course,\nin real terms, AI is incredibly more\nefficient than a than a consultant.\n[snorts] Okay, maybe I have to cut that\nout.\nYeah, I'm trying to find So, this is um\ncloud cuz you were showing a way to\nshare cloud sessions. You can take a\nsession and you can create a nice web\npage from it. Yeah. Using Simon Willis's\ntool.\n>> Yeah, I can link to the my blog.\n>> And then there's this thing called the\nthe cloud um I don't know what it stands\nfor like assistant session reviewer and\nit's Cass\nand it you run an indexer across your\ncloud session directory and it will it's\nusing oh it's using Rust so it must be\nfast, right? Okay.\n>> Oh, come on. This is trivial stuff, but\nyou could do this in shell.\n>> No, but the fact is that that like\n>> Okay. So, so you're basically going\nacross all your conversations.\n>> Yeah. Across everything and you can type\nlike a small little like a single word\nand it will find all of them. I think\nit's doing a fuzzy search. I'm not sure.\nBut my indexer has an error apparent on\nits another problem is\n>> so so when it comes to these transcripts\nI feel like um there needs to be a tool\nto say like\num to to rate to rate the transcripts\nright like like this was a really good\nsession this this session sucked what\nwent wrong here what went right here you\nknow these these sort of like metadata\nso we have a way of sharing transcripts\nbut we don't have a great way\n>> oh look at even works across open code\nand codex in Gemini.\n>> Yeah. Nice. So we don't have we don't\nhave a nice way of of really\nlearning as a human how to interact with\nAI. I feel because if we if we feed\nthese transcripts back into AI and\nasking how to improve I think that I'm\nnot too sure it might work but\n>> yeah but that's not\n>> but I'm I'm talking about upskilling\nteams getting getting people more to\nbuild trust with the and building shared\nprompts and things like that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I'm this\nis what I'm trying to do at work.\n>> So, this is one thing that they\nhighlight in um somebody asked a\nquestion in the KO talk saying, \"Can I\ncustomize the templates and the prompts\nand the workflow and they're like they\nare over here?\" I don't remember the\nanswer, but it it seemed like given the\nway that they are so structured, I think\nit's hard for you to change those\nthings. And um I definitely feel that\nthose templates, those workflows, like I\ntry to use speckit to set up some type\nof uh ADR. So it's funny because speckit\nis ADR in a way kind not really exactly\nthe same, but it's in a way you're\ncapturing like a decision\nrecord, right? Um, so I was trying to\nask specit to create a decision record\nand it couldn't really get it because\nlike, oh, you're building a program. So,\nand I was like, yeah, no, but we're\nusing LLMs. I was like, oh, so you're\nbuilding a program that um is going to,\nyou know, you know, you're going to call\nout to the open API and and I was like,\nno, no, no. I'm trying to do something.\n[laughter] So, it was really uh really\ndifficult to get it to do kind of like\nmeta meta spec type of things like I\nwant you to create a library of prompts\nto use for my community planning\nsessions and things like that. It was\nlike huh I only know how to create a\nprogram just like so you want me to\ncreate a program to run your community\nmeetings? No, no, that's not what I\nwant. So, it was um so yes, you need to\nbe able to modify these workflows. Uh I\ntried conductor first by the way to have\na feel of it.\n>> Oh, yeah. Oh,\n>> did you have a good experience like I\ndid?\n>> No, actually both conductor even though\nin the in the product design and\ndefinition I said very clearly like what\nwe're building here is a way to like a a\ntype of a process for the repository. I\nwant to build a pro. So it's a repo for\nkeeping track of decisions and proposals\nand spec and so on and and um no didn't\ngo for that. Again, probably not the\nright project for it. But yeah, other\nthan that, conductor was pretty cool. I\nI feel it actually kept kept Gemini\ngoing like uh I thought at some point\nwhen I finished with all of the upfront\nplanning, Gemini went in a loop and for\na significant amount of time kept going.\nI've never seen Gemini keep going like\nthat uh in a while. Have you had the\nsame experience with conductor like\nthat? It can keep keep Gemini going a\nbit like\n>> Well, it was a good experience. So I\nguess I I don't I mean it was a week ago\nif not more. So I guess I guess it was\ndoing its thing. Yeah, I guess it was\ndoing it thing. [snorts] Oh, okay. You\nknow what? I need the weather is\nactually good right now. It's not\nraining. I feel like I need to wash my\ncar and run around while there's some\nsunlight. So I think I'm going to end\nthe conversation a bit early if you\ndon't mind. I still think I still think\nwhat we talked about was valuable. I\ndon't know if if we I guess at this\npoint I would like to engage anyone\nwho's listening to please comment below\nand uh chime in with your thoughts\naround making AI uh I mean are you\npositive about AI and things like that\nor another interesting thing that Theo\ndid he had like a little poll on his\nvideo to say that do you think Opus or\ndo you think Claude is outputting better\ncode than you are at this point and I\nthink it was like 65%\nagree agreed that Claude is already\nbetter than them at coding, which I\nthought was interesting. And to be\nhonest, I agree. Like I don't know how\nyou feel. Me too.\n>> Yeah, me too. I think it's better\nbecause it's better than me.\n>> Uh it's more like it has a broader\nknowledge base like it can produce code\nfor a broader set of things that I don't\nknow.\n>> Yeah. But even if I ask it to produce Go\ncode or or code or languages I know\nquite well, I I don't I think it's\npretty okay.\n>> No, but I liked Steve's take saying that\nit's way better at Go than at\nTypescript. I always felt TypeScript is\nperfect because it gives you the\nstructure and the schemas, but Steve\nsays types is TypeScript is way too you\ncan do way too fancy things with types\nand TypeScript and Go is just really\ndown to the you know straightforward. So\nso AI is better with Go. There there's\nsome arguments made I think oh I can't I\ncan't remember his name now uh the\neducator guy he was who makes some\ntypescript courses he was arguing that\ntypes and AI go well together because\nyou want those that that that test\n>> I always feel like that but Steve Jger\nwas saying that that he he he rewrote\ngas\n>> typescript was was sucks in that regard\n>> he says it's it's a token waste it's\nit's generating a ton of tokens that\ndon't really do much and uh and with\n>> code is so much cleaner\nand direct although that I like what I\nlike with go is this very um you know\nwrite everything twice mentality of go\nwhich is like don't over generalize no\ngenerics for ages don't like just\nrewrite the code rewrite the functions\n>> I still I still don't even quite\nunderstand generics I mean I don't use\nthem so maybe I'm missing out\n>> I I did originally when I was writing\ncode golang but when I asked the llam to\nwrite I I go like yeah don't like I\ndon't mind it being duplicated in\nseveral places cuz I'm like\n>> Yeah, exactly. It's cheap. Yeah. To do\nall the different uh\n>> you need to maintain it. It's going to\nfigure out\n>> switches and all that sort of stuff.\nYeah. Yeah. I get it. I mean, go it. I\nmean, I'm feeling pretty pretty uh #\nuh what do you call it? Inspired #\ngrateful. because I know Go better than\nmost people and uh and I know AI better\nthan most people in some ways and\neverything everything's coming together\nreally nicely for me. I feel and I'm\ntouching wood here. is like everything's\ngoing well except maybe my pay packet.\nBut uh\nyou also did one final uh because the\nwhole tailwind laying off 75% of staff\nand then people saying well well if your\nbusiness model was like what was their\nbusiness model right how that they got\ndisrupted. I don't know if you know\nabout this whole Tailwind scenario.\n>> Oh yeah I didn't I did notice that was\nthat was interesting. Uh I think I\ndidn't read the whole post and he also\nmade a podcast himself, right? Where\nhe's walking his\n>> I read the post and I listened to the\nwhole podcast.\n>> Oh, really? So you probably have more\ndetails, but but my my uh what do you\ncall it? Headline reading interpretation\nwas that was that um yeah the LLM was\nwas was taking their business away\nbecause uh you didn't need to use\nTailwind and its abstractions I suppose\nto do to work with CSS. You can just get\nClaude to do it.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then it boiled down also to the\nwebsite. So I think there's this llm.ext\nand they removed it because they don't\nwant to\n>> the thing that triggered it is somebody\nwent I'm going to here's a pull request\nto add the llm.txt to your docs.\n>> And he was I'm sorry but I have to\ndecline this. I just had to lay out 75%\nbecause the docs are our only funnel and\nnobody's reading them because the LLMs\nare just generating code. Nobody's\nreading our docs anymore. And it's how\nwe we funnel our business. We've got 80%\ndown uh in revenue. Um for you know was\nit 80% down in traffic through through\nuh those funnels. So he's measuring\nthose different you know ways that they\nare driving business right and and a lot\nof discussions\n>> stack overflow problem in a way but\nwhatever it's different. Yeah. Uh so a\nlot of people were saying like from\nTailwind they realized as a as a an\nexpert um I have a network and people\ncome to me to and and that's how I get\njobs but that all falls away with AI. Uh\nand and then some some of the uh um he\nsays I've been sponsoring Tailwind for a\nlong time. Love what they do. I learned\na lot from them. So in his video was\nmore like highlighting all the good work\nthat they've done and he shared like\nthere's this even if you are using an\nLLM reading their design um you know\nguides like they have they written a\nbook on how to do the UX which is not\njust about the CSS but really about like\nhow to build uh UX. He says that's a\nreally good book then you should really\nread it and he's also encouraging people\nto sponsor them.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. But that I mean I'm sponsoring is\nalways not a solution right? You need a\nviable business business model. If their\nbusiness model is upselling through\ntheir docs, yeah, they're in problem. I\nmean, and interestingly, Charlie from\nthe Astro Project mentioned that that\nthey have LLM's text, but they also have\na similar they're they're in the similar\nboat\n>> because they need to upsell their other\num\n>> they're hosting, I guess. Oh, they have\nsome um\nwhat is there? I can't even remember\nwhat they're business. [snorts]\n>> There's a there's a there's a product\nthat I think they were working on. Oh,\nthis Pyx thing.\n>> I think that's\n>> going to be uh a paid for thing.\n>> That's like Dino then. Dino and Bun like\nreinventing the packaging. Well, not\nBun, but Dino reinventing the packaging.\nSo, so you get the point that everything\ncould just Yeah, they're in the similar\nboat. Okay. Anyway, I'm I'm interrupting\nI'm interrupting you.\n>> No, the other thing that Tio said is as\na as a business, if you let LLM generate\nyour code, go check the dependencies and\nsee if you can go sponsor them like if\nbut but to me it seems like the real\nsolution is is ads, right? This is how\nWarp they say like we're giving you Opus\n4 access for a fraction of the cost\nbecause they put\n>> no one's going to read the docs ads. How\nyou\n>> Yeah. Because ultimately inside the docs\nare ads. Like if you like to if you like\nthis here's our our offering, right? So\nif you translate it, nobody's going to\nthe dogs. It means that those ads no\nlonger live with the dogs, but they must\nbe surfaced by the LM somehow, right?\nAnd Warp's uh operating model is like we\ngive cheap AI access in our terminal by\nserving you ads and that's like\nand and you know if OpenAI would\nintroduce that you know the alterate is\nalready created but it's the only way\nlike if OpenAI can semantically\n>> any business that requires ads now I\nguess with with LLMs in the mix LLMs are\nfiltering out the ads\n>> so any business model that relies on ads\nis basically in trouble here and it\nprobably includes includes Google.\n>> Google of course. Yeah, Google. Google\nhad a big re wakeup call. They had all\nhands on deck\n>> uh early in the in the Chad GPT saga.\n>> So what is what is Google's response\nthere\n>> to become a leader because they have put\nso much money. They have their own TPUs.\nThey build their own Gemini CLI. They\nthey become an LLM platform.\n>> But like okay, go going back to\nTailwind. I mean don't say sponsorship\nis the answer because it's not. What is\nVincent? How do you think they're gonna\ncome out of this or how how is Astral\ngoing to come out of this?\n>> I think if the LLMs I guess it's it's\nthe whole problem with LLM's not giving\nattribution, right? If there's a way for\nLLMs to give better attribution and it's\nlike I'm you know imagine that while\nit's generating your website it goes and\nby the way there's a sale on Tailwind\nright now. [laughter]\nI'm I'm using Tailwind to build your\nwebsite. No. Um,\n>> that sounds like another weird form of\nadvertising which sounds insane.\n>> It would be funny if if if you're try if\nyou're using the MCP or you're\ntroubleshooting the issue and you're\ngoing like, you know, it's still not\nlooking right. There's still an\noverlaying bug. It just stops. I just\nsaid, go to the Tailwind team, dude.\nLike, [laughter] go ask them to fix to\nhelp you fix it.\n>> Pay them. Um, cuz I don't have the\nanswer here. [laughter]\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh god. I think if a company is smart\nand and onropic is smart because they\ndid like the double limits usage limits\nfor for the whole Christmas holiday that\nwas a gigantic success. Look at how many\npeople tried it out. They were like I\ngot so much done and I'm 100% in on this\nright now. I actually upgraded to $100.\n>> They just they're like drug dealers,\naren't they?\n>> Yeah. So if there's if if Antropic is\nlistening, Boris, [laughter]\n>> if they're smart, what they're going to\ndo is they're going to make\n>> more correct.\n>> Yeah. like loop detected. Um, please\nlike based on the context it looks like\nlike Clippy pops up. Looks like you're\ntrying to fix a wind a tailwind issue.\n[laughter]\nHere's the tailwind guys website.\n>> No, I think your proposal I mean it's\nfrankly\n>> ads are coming. Ads are coming. I think\nthis is\n>> there's got to be a better Okay,\n>> I'm going to do a hot take. Hot take\n2026 hot take from Vincent. Ads in your\nLLMs this year. Guaranteed warp's\nalready there. So I already what? Not\nexcept for warp. Let's talk.\n>> Arguably there already ads like when you\nrun claude it gives you like a tip. Try\nthis mobile experience. Try this.\n>> But it's always there. It's always like\nuse our our designer plugin for better\nweb design. What about it goes like use\nthe Tailwind MCP subscription only $5 a\nmonth. [laughter]\nOkay. Bye. Go wash your car.\nLet's see how many people hate comments.\n[snorts]\n>> Okay, please please please rate the\npodcast. Please comment below. Please\ntell me how we tell us how we can\nimprove. Actually, I did get feedback\nfrom from from Swix, but the the\nRiverside thing looks a bit too\nexpensive for me at least. It's like £24\na month\n>> to to improve the quality. I was like, I\ndon't want to spend money.\n>> Everything's improving except my pay\npacket.\nUh, I did earn I Oh, yeah. I should I\nshould note maybe I can give you access\nto my YouTube studio, but I think I I've\nearned two pound\nthanks to this whole podcast series. So,\nthanks Vincent for coming on the show.\n>> That's two pound off for a family of\nfour.\n>> Two pound. I I'll I think I'll can buy\nyou a coffee when I see you in Vietnam\nor something.\n>> Yeah. Come to Vietnam. You can feast\n>> for exactly one meal.\n>> Wow. [laughter]\nYeah, I that's probably the real issue\nthat we should have talked about is how\npeople's pay because Madu Shan who I was\nchatting to on X, he was right to point\nout that that people's income is not\nimproving.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah. [clears throat]\n>> Okay. See you guys.\n>> See you.\n>> See you guys. Oh my god. I say you guys.\nSorry. So, see you Vincent.\n>> Comment below. Bye.\n>> You guys and girls. Come on.\n>> Oh yeah. Sorry.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:00] Yo, how was your trip yesterday?\n[0:03] >> It was pretty epic. There was a huge\n[0:05] storm in the UK actually and I'm and I\n[0:07] pretty much drove well, not through it,\n[0:10] but like I stopped off at my sisters and\n[0:13] then I and then when it passed, I drove\n[0:16] after it. So, I got to see the beginning\n[0:18] of it and the and the after of it. So,\n[0:22] it was a pretty epic storm.\n[0:24] >> Have you seen that kite surfing video?\n[0:27] [clears throat] There was like\n[0:29] >> in Israel\n[0:31] >> during a storm\n[0:31] >> there was like a thermal vortex like a\n[0:35] little cyclone and some kite surfers got\n[0:37] caught into it and one guy he went like\n[0:40] super high but he was able to eject when\n[0:42] he was lowered to the ground. The other\n[0:44] guy he got dragged onto rocks and died.\n[0:46] So it was um it's been posted like four\n[0:49] or five times on Reddit. Maybe because I\n[0:50] like to kite surfer so I see it.\n[0:52] >> It's pretty bad. But yeah, you're\n[0:54] talking about the storm reminded me.\n[0:55] Sorry you were saying after the storm.\n[0:56] Uh but I mean to be honest we were not\n[0:59] impacted. But one thing that makes me\n[1:01] nervous is that um I think last year was\n[1:04] it the year before we had a storm durag\n[1:07] and we were out of power for like two 47\n[1:10] hours. Is that two days almost?\n[1:13] And it was pretty terrible because\n[1:16] without power we cannot actually power\n[1:20] our oil\n[1:22] or gas heating systems.\n[1:25] >> Basically [snorts]\n[1:26] It really goes to hell here very\n[1:28] quickly. And uh and funny and the other\n[1:32] thing that really irritates me is that\n[1:33] like as a South African if I'm actually\n[1:37] used to the power to go to go out but\n[1:41] the infrastructure the mobile\n[1:43] infrastructure it always has like a huge\n[1:45] backup. Your audio just switched\n[1:49] >> from what to what?\n[1:51] >> I don't know the audio. Maybe when you\n[1:52] when you moved closer. Maybe it's it's\n[1:55] >> Oh, you know what? I think I I knocked\n[1:57] out the bloody\n[2:00] uh RX or something.\n[2:03] >> Yeah. Test.\n[2:07] >> No, when you said that about um you\n[2:09] couldn't turn on your electric like\n[2:11] cooking or or anything. When I wanted I\n[2:14] came to Vietnam, I I really hated those\n[2:16] gas cookers.\n[2:18] >> Oh, yeah. But now you love them.\n[2:21] >> And and the fire. I don't like it\n[2:22] because I see videos of these gas\n[2:24] canisters exploding and things like\n[2:26] that. And I was begging my um my wife to\n[2:29] get like um an electric cooker and she's\n[2:32] like, \"No way.\" You know, there's going\n[2:33] to be a power outage and we can't cook.\n[2:35] >> Yeah.\n[2:36] >> Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. [snorts] So we\n[2:38] have we have like a little Korean set\n[2:40] and those little butane canisters for\n[2:42] for for these occasions.\n[2:44] >> But yeah, going back to the the\n[2:46] infrastructure cuz this is the AI\n[2:48] infrastructure podcast.\n[2:49] >> Yeah.\n[2:50] >> In South Africa, the infrastructure is\n[2:51] very robust.\n[2:54] But when the power goes out here in uh\n[2:57] you know 5 minutes later my 4G signal\n[2:59] disappears and then\n[3:01] >> really and yeah like none of the none of\n[3:04] the masts in England have backup power.\n[3:06] Maybe they do it out in like London, but\n[3:08] around here in the southwest, none have\n[3:10] backup power. [snorts]\n[3:12] >> You weren't afraid it was going to be\n[3:13] like like a Venezuela incident. They\n[3:15] take out the the power in the city and\n[3:17] next thing you know, your prime minister\n[3:18] is on a plane back to the US.\n[3:20] >> Well, yeah. Well, the resiliency factor\n[3:22] in in UK and I do think it's related to\n[3:26] the well to the mobile infrastructure is\n[3:28] is very poor actually. So if the if any\n[3:32] Russians are listening to this\n[3:34] >> Yeah.\n[3:35] >> now you know\n[3:37] >> but I know they take London in in u\n[3:40] what's this movie with um Edge with Tom\n[3:44] Cruz\n[3:46] uh where he brings tomorrow.\n[3:47] >> Yeah, tomorrow's edge. [gasps]\n[3:49] >> They take London very quickly as soon as\n[3:51] the the beach uh battle was lost.\n[3:54] [laughter]\n[3:55] >> Tomorrow's I watched the movie like four\n[3:57] or five times. I know it's maybe because\n[3:59] you like and you like games. Anyway,\n[4:02] >> the Anyway,\n[4:04] >> one of the things I wanted to that was\n[4:06] just banging around my head after being\n[4:09] at on on site\n[4:11] um the last couple of days was that\n[4:17] on on one on one side I have you know\n[4:20] since I'm a middle manager I don't know\n[4:22] how you feel you are in in the industry\n[4:24] but I mean I do feel like I'm a very\n[4:27] hands-on middle manager but nonetheless\n[4:29] I'm a middle manager since I'm my middle\n[4:31] manager. I have I have the the executive\n[4:34] sort of asking me, \"Hey, Kai, um how's\n[4:37] this AI thing going? Um it makes people\n[4:40] more productive, right? It it's how much\n[4:43] more productive 100 100% 200% how can\n[4:46] you just tell can you build a case study\n[4:49] for me to show how how more productive\n[4:51] you are with AI?\" And this is in that\n[4:53] said and the AI roller in this\n[4:56] particular customer is incredibly\n[4:58] frustrating and bad because they disable\n[5:01] uh all the good models. So that I got on\n[5:03] one hand I've got the these sort of\n[5:05] questions and then and then for the sort\n[5:07] of the colleagues sort of um that I work\n[5:10] with\n[5:12] many of them are actually um quite\n[5:14] nervous about the future and um okay I'm\n[5:19] exaggerating here when they when they\n[5:21] when I think in my in the in the notes I\n[5:24] call them doomers but like a lot of\n[5:26] people say like are basically like uh\n[5:29] saying to me that like oh um AI isn't\n[5:33] going to make me um you know twice as\n[5:36] effective. And it's absolute [ __ ]\n[5:38] that management are are coming up with\n[5:40] these things as an excuse to uh reorg\n[5:43] and lay off people. But that's the way\n[5:45] they feel and and and and\n[5:49] I'm in the middle and I don't know and\n[5:52] my feeling is is is just trying to be\n[5:56] well I am a positive I like to think I'm\n[5:58] a positive person. Some some people\n[6:00] might disagree with with with that\n[6:02] sentiment, but like I'm very excited\n[6:04] about the future. I am so excited, but\n[6:07] at the same time, like I can't really\n[6:10] like my my fun factor that we have in\n[6:13] our little podcast chats, I does that\n[6:15] translate to a 200% productivity? I I I\n[6:18] I am reluctant to say that. and and at\n[6:22] the same time I'm like how do I make how\n[6:24] do I make people more positive who are\n[6:26] around me or or you know\n[6:30] >> report to me you know what I mean\n[6:32] >> okay let's because you touched on like\n[6:33] five different points I think the first\n[6:35] one you mentioned is how do you me\n[6:36] measure productivity and that's all\n[6:38] about the devops accelerate report right\n[6:41] dora metrics how many times do you\n[6:43] deploy how long product feature to go to\n[6:45] production\n[6:47] >> let's be real a lot of these dora\n[6:48] metrics aren't aren't extremely well\n[6:51] recorded and and things like that and\n[6:53] they're very hard to\n[6:55] >> No, no, there are so we implemented the\n[6:57] Dora metrics well me uh a a colleague of\n[7:00] mine implemented the Dora metrics as a\n[7:02] previous company and you you have four\n[7:05] clear metrics that are well defined of\n[7:07] what you need to measure and they are\n[7:09] the key I can argue with you but carry\n[7:11] on\n[7:14] >> and like meantime between failure is is\n[7:17] often something that's quite contentious\n[7:19] I\n[7:21] It's you're the matter is you need to\n[7:24] measure where you are and then measure\n[7:27] the improvements, right? So it's about\n[7:30] taking snapshots. It's about agreeing.\n[7:32] Yeah, sure.\n[7:35] They identified these are the metrics\n[7:37] that correlate to productive um\n[7:39] companies or companies that are\n[7:40] successful according to the research\n[7:42] that they've been doing sponsored by\n[7:44] Google over several years looking at\n[7:46] many different companies and across\n[7:48] different industries and different\n[7:49] styles of companies maturity and all and\n[7:52] they said look those four metrics start\n[7:53] measuring them. So then this the fact is\n[7:56] source of truth. Where do I get this\n[7:58] information? How exactly do I measure\n[8:00] that for this particular team for this\n[8:01] particular product, right? Um where does\n[8:04] the the you know how long does it take\n[8:06] for a feature to be from specified down\n[8:09] to production and and how do I measure\n[8:12] that you know do I go to GitHub? Is\n[8:14] there like a certain Jira ticket\n[8:16] attached to the pull request and can I\n[8:18] see when the when the Jira is you know\n[8:20] progressing along the different stages\n[8:22] and when the is the mer is a branch\n[8:24] merged and the release tech and so on\n[8:27] right so that was the exercise really at\n[8:30] my previous company that um a part of\n[8:32] the team did and they started having\n[8:33] snapshots for every team the data team\n[8:36] the cloud team the app team you know the\n[8:38] iPad app team\n[8:39] >> snapshots by team yeah\n[8:42] >> yeah and then they start showing okay\n[8:43] this team's quite well on the way on the\n[8:46] on their on their journey uh after one\n[8:48] month two months uh improvements and so\n[8:50] on. So then I think if you started doing\n[8:52] those snapshots early before the AI\n[8:54] adoption you can definitely you know\n[8:56] compare this team has heavily\n[8:59] >> I mean I wish I wish it was that easy\n[9:01] but maybe I'm just being making coming\n[9:03] up with excuses but like\n[9:06] >> yeah it really comes down to just doing\n[9:08] like breaking it down in small steps and\n[9:10] doing it. I hate I have some colleagues\n[9:12] that are constantly going about what if\n[9:14] yes we have to understand the problem so\n[9:16] we can well define the solution but at\n[9:18] the same time if we spend days arguing\n[9:21] back and forth about what is that of how\n[9:23] it really works until like put it then\n[9:26] you know spin up I'm very quick to spin\n[9:28] up a docker compos cluster with the\n[9:29] different uh you know like the engineext\n[9:31] and whatever like this was particularly\n[9:32] about rate limiting or or about shared\n[9:34] memory right using a swap\n[9:36] >> rate limiting I I I worked on an enginex\n[9:39] rate limiting uh uh module back a couple\n[9:42] of gigs ago.\n[9:43] >> Yeah,\n[9:43] >> we should.\n[9:44] >> So, the thing is I hate I hate these\n[9:46] very theoretical like I want a a very\n[9:49] early MVP definition. What do we need to\n[9:53] do to to prove some of this? And that's\n[9:55] what the guy in in in in that comp in\n[9:57] the company I worked for did. He went\n[9:59] with like a pre-prepared\n[10:01] uh solution like pop flash or pop dog\n[10:04] something. It's not pop dog because\n[10:05] that's the train in in in in\n[10:07] Counterstrike. [laughter]\n[10:09] uh with it's like pop up. So something\n[10:12] like that. Anyway,\n[10:13] >> but like okay I\n[10:14] >> was a very clear path very didn't take\n[10:17] long took quick. Okay, you're talking\n[10:21] about making some stone cold\n[10:23] measurements and you're right. You're\n[10:25] absolutely right.\n[10:27] >> But I had a second point and and I think\n[10:29] that the objective, but like how do you\n[10:31] deal with people's, you know, vibes, you\n[10:34] know, that's\n[10:34] >> Yeah. So people second thing, right?\n[10:36] First thing is the metrics because this\n[10:38] is the same problem that we always face\n[10:39] as a platform team where we're not\n[10:41] directly um valued against the business\n[10:44] and we need to our metrics really come\n[10:46] down to the Dora metrics, right? we need\n[10:48] to optimize for those and we need to\n[10:50] prove that our efforts and our projects\n[10:52] optimize those metrics. So that's how\n[10:54] you can attach value to a platform team\n[10:56] aside from constantly asking them to to\n[10:59] >> So have you honestly had success? So\n[11:01] this is how you've defended your DevOps\n[11:04] uh work in the past by saying like uh\n[11:07] you know hey we are delivering uh faster\n[11:10] thanks to my work. I mean or you or you\n[11:13] just playing this by the book?\n[11:15] >> No. Um\n[11:16] >> do you have a real case study?\n[11:18] >> Yeah, but I found so the team that I was\n[11:20] in was doing this. I think I stayed for\n[11:23] 6 months and then I left. [laughter] Um\n[11:26] because I wanted I thought there was\n[11:28] fundamentally something wrong with the\n[11:29] way that the platform was was being\n[11:31] developed and I wanted instead of\n[11:33] constantly being forced to go and you\n[11:35] know do little bandates on the different\n[11:38] teams infrastructure I wanted to have a\n[11:41] proper design but I've also learned that\n[11:43] that is not really something um but\n[11:46] anyway so I've seen they because there\n[11:50] was a very strong culture of sharing\n[11:52] results in that company so there was\n[11:54] always this big all all hands-on\n[11:56] meetings where every team presented the\n[11:58] results. So, the team presented those\n[11:59] dashboards, but I did think a lot of\n[12:02] those numbers were being fudged for\n[12:03] example.\n[12:04] >> Oh, yeah, of course. Oh my god. I was\n[12:06] That's what I was going to say. I mean,\n[12:08] if if you have a culture of doing line\n[12:10] graphs, it's going to be so bad.\n[12:13] >> Yeah. No, but also like there was this\n[12:15] initiative to to increase the AWS\n[12:18] resource tagging and one approach was to\n[12:21] add tags and tax policies around the\n[12:23] infrastructure as code so that they are\n[12:25] being measured and pull requests are\n[12:27] being uh blocked until tag tag coverage\n[12:30] improves and so on until beatings will\n[12:33] continue until the memorial improves.\n[12:35] [laughter] Anyway, um but in those cases\n[12:37] >> will continue. I've never heard that one\n[12:39] but it's quite hilarious. It's I think\n[12:41] it's from Montipython not uh you know um\n[12:45] yeah\n[12:47] >> will continue until the moral improves.\n[12:49] Yeah. So [laughter] but in this case\n[12:51] they actually went through manually and\n[12:52] added tags all over the place and it was\n[12:54] justified because some of the resources\n[12:56] were not under IC. But to be honest I\n[12:58] think it was just a a hack because they\n[13:00] were under IC and you just had to go put\n[13:03] it just to present the report like yeah\n[13:04] we improved tech coverage from 20% to\n[13:07] 60%. like, \"Okay, fuck.\"\n[13:10] >> I hate sitting in these meetings because\n[13:11] I'm just like thinking, \"Oh my god, this\n[13:13] is bullshit.\" But if I say something,\n[13:16] then everyone's going to think I'm the\n[13:18] biggest [ __ ] in the room.\n[13:21] >> Yeah, I do say some things. But I've\n[13:23] learned to say those things not in\n[13:24] public channels anymore. [laughter]\n[13:27] >> But I go [snorts] to people, I say like\n[13:29] that's not right. You just added the\n[13:30] tags manually.\n[13:31] >> Private meetings will resume.\n[13:34] [laughter] So, but then the second part\n[13:35] you touched on is about the human aspect\n[13:37] like because yes sure you can measure a\n[13:39] team per team and you can measure those\n[13:41] metrics but this is something that Jean\n[13:43] Kim and Steve Jagger touched on in their\n[13:45] talk right when they said like they had\n[13:47] a problem in OpenAI um in where how can\n[13:50] you compare somebody that has fully\n[13:52] adopted LLM versus someone who hasn't\n[13:54] because if they looked at at the\n[13:55] traditional metrics someone who has\n[13:58] adopted AI is doing a lot better and and\n[14:00] so\n[14:01] >> well they say that and they don't really\n[14:03] tell you\n[14:04] >> because they sell it also, right?\n[14:05] >> Yeah. And this is the this is the\n[14:07] frustrating thing is like, oh yeah,\n[14:09] they're much better. They're 10 times 10\n[14:11] times engineer, but like uh okay, how do\n[14:13] you\n[14:15] >> that's just the 10x engineer is like a\n[14:18] is is a meme, isn't it? It's just means\n[14:20] that that that they're\n[14:23] >> a red flag. Once I was interview I was\n[14:25] interviewed for a company and I I I\n[14:28] passed and they offered me and I I\n[14:30] wasn't really accepting the offer and\n[14:32] then they called me in and and then the\n[14:34] they called in like the CTO or CEO and\n[14:38] he came in I heard you're like a\n[14:40] >> ax 10x engineer\n[14:42] >> or or what do you call a hero or\n[14:44] something like that and the moment I\n[14:46] hear that word and then the other\n[14:48] examples was like you know our\n[14:49] originally founders they rewrote the\n[14:51] whole thing in in three nights of Red\n[14:53] Bull Uh, and I'm like, \"Yeah, no, no,\n[14:55] I'm not joining your company.\"\n[14:57] [laughter] If that's what you um, you\n[14:59] know, think is a good like work life\n[15:01] balance. Um, that's not the\n[15:04] >> living in you are living in Asia. Work\n[15:06] life balance.\n[15:07] >> Yeah. Yeah. That was\n[15:08] >> Here we are talking about work on on a\n[15:10] Saturday morning. Work life balance.\n[15:12] >> I'm not talking about work. I'm ranting.\n[15:15] [laughter]\n[15:16] >> This is my my my exhaust. My\n[15:20] >> this is my therapy. No, but like um\n[15:23] you're right with Jean then and um maybe\n[15:26] they are selling these they are selling\n[15:28] AI and they're selling um this. So where\n[15:32] are the actual measurements? I don't\n[15:34] know. Maybe they were referring\n[15:35] something that's publicly available and\n[15:36] I haven't read it. I just took them for\n[15:38] their word. So\n[15:38] >> Oh yeah. I mean also that that anthropic\n[15:40] thing I think we discussed that earlier.\n[15:42] I mean\n[15:44] >> the report the that report that was made\n[15:46] by a\n[15:47] >> Oh yeah\n[15:48] >> there was this entropic report and and\n[15:50] it was like we asked cloud to estimate\n[15:52] the task and then it finished it in 10%\n[15:54] of the time. We asked cloud to analyze\n[15:56] all of its work and it and it estimated\n[15:57] that it finished it all in 10% of the\n[16:00] time. It's like yeah well [laughter]\n[16:04] >> I guess the next thing I'm going to do\n[16:05] is ask ask Gemini or Claude how to u\n[16:10] measure the productivity gains. And of\n[16:12] course it does feel completely wrong to\n[16:15] do it that way.\n[16:17] >> Yeah.\n[16:19] >> I I mean\n[16:19] >> unless unless it can it can surface\n[16:21] hard. I'm inclined to to just pull it\n[16:24] back to vibes, you know, like so I was\n[16:28] asked to give a pres internal\n[16:29] presentation about the the gains of AI\n[16:33] and um I'm thinking of just just uh\n[16:39] turning turning the talk into something\n[16:41] like how people are happier.\n[16:45] uh which might not go down well and I\n[16:47] might get\n[16:49] but I think I think that's the key thing\n[16:52] for me. I'm actually just genuinely\n[16:54] happier because I can now deliver faster\n[16:57] and better work.\n[17:00] You know what a team lead of me in the\n[17:02] past, he used to do the standup uh you\n[17:05] know every weekly sync up or I think it\n[17:07] was weekly and he would ask the mood\n[17:10] like happy sad every time for every\n[17:14] every member to measure it.\n[17:16] >> Yeah. As part of the standup like you\n[17:18] know what did you you but it wasn't\n[17:20] standup maybe it was like the weekly uh\n[17:22] check-in or something like that. But but\n[17:24] team white everyone\n[17:25] >> Yeah. Yeah. But that's that's a typical\n[17:26] thing you do in a retro for example, you\n[17:28] know. Yeah, you have safety check.\n[17:30] >> If you have [clears throat] if you have\n[17:32] >> if you have recorded it then you can say\n[17:35] well since we rolled out cloud code\n[17:36] plans to everyone happiness has gone up.\n[17:39] >> Yeah but\n[17:41] >> anxiousness has gone up too. [laughter]\n[17:43] Well, it's a difficult it's difficult to\n[17:45] measure that too because ultimately\n[17:49] >> I mean like personally\n[17:51] I I I can be maybe it's the my Germanic\n[17:55] blood but like I wake up in the morning\n[17:57] and I'm not freaking happy dude\n[17:59] >> and then people hey happy new year how's\n[18:02] it going like like please\n[18:03] >> like yeah sure\n[18:06] >> cloud deployed all of my features that I\n[18:08] I estimated for two weeks of work in\n[18:10] just 3 days but at the same time the\n[18:12] toilet on the second level is broken.\n[18:14] It's like [laughter]\n[18:16] >> Yeah. Oh, actually that that reminds me\n[18:19] my particular client the the office has\n[18:22] so many like problems.\n[18:25] But I do think overall I think after the\n[18:28] Christmas period, New Year period, the\n[18:31] sentiment and the way people talk about\n[18:33] AI has significantly changed.\n[18:37] People are more like declaring that they\n[18:39] don't look at their code.\n[18:41] >> Yeah. more\n[18:42] >> that video. I mean, you linked it to me.\n[18:44] I can't believe he was right.\n[18:47] >> Yes. From\n[18:47] >> that Theo video. I to be honest, I find\n[18:49] Theo a little bit irritating to watch\n[18:51] for some reason. But like I did\n[18:52] >> I always complain, but I always watch\n[18:54] his videos.\n[18:54] >> Yeah, I did watch his video and I\n[18:56] thought he I thought he was absolutely\n[18:58] spot on. I even I even uh\n[19:00] >> You're good.\n[19:01] >> I even tweeted. Yeah. So,\n[19:04] I don't know. Maybe it's his hair. But\n[19:06] anyway, the\n[19:08] >> it's just a side comments of like but I\n[19:10] I felt maybe I got used to them or I\n[19:12] feel there's less. He was very much\n[19:14] frustrated that Antropic was not giving\n[19:16] him anything and he was very much saying\n[19:18] OpenAI is doing a great job but maybe\n[19:20] because it more aligns with me now.\n[19:21] Maybe it's my little bubble and it fits\n[19:23] in my bubble better. I was like, \"Oh,\n[19:25] he's he's hailing on Tropic now. I like\n[19:27] to watch his videos.\" [laughter] But but\n[19:30] I still feel like\n[19:32] um perhaps I need to rewatch the video,\n[19:34] but like um\n[19:37] yeah, there was that that that\n[19:39] [clears throat] whole spiel about not\n[19:41] not looking at the code anymore. But I\n[19:44] still feel like people\n[19:46] I felt like he said it well maybe I'm\n[19:48] just daydreaming at the moment but like\n[19:50] I still there's still a lot of people\n[19:53] who somehow throw in a weird argument\n[19:55] that like I'm not looking at my code but\n[19:57] at the same time I still I do look at I\n[19:59] do look at it just to make sure it's\n[20:02] it's producing good code like so what is\n[20:04] it? Are you looking or you're not\n[20:05] looking? You know, but I mean are are\n[20:07] you like what do you mean by I'm not\n[20:09] looking? You know, this is I feel like\n[20:12] people are not being super honest about\n[20:13] it.\n[20:15] >> I think it's a it's um it's a it's a\n[20:19] slope. How do you say it's like a a\n[20:21] range of of looking at code? I'm looking\n[20:23] at code.\n[20:24] >> I'm not looking uh\n[20:26] >> it's a range. Yes. I'm looking like at\n[20:29] every line or I'm looking at the\n[20:30] functions or I'm looking at the file\n[20:32] structures or I'm looking at the you\n[20:34] know architecture high level um you know\n[20:37] cleanliness of of of it perhaps um but\n[20:43] I had something else I wanted to say and\n[20:45] now it's gone oh no that the other I\n[20:46] thought you were going with that\n[20:47] sentence like I'm not looking at the\n[20:48] code but it's and then they say it's the\n[20:51] most well- tested and validated code\n[20:54] that I have ever delivered in my life\n[20:56] and and a lot of people say that like\n[20:57] I've never spend so much like effort on\n[21:00] unit tests because and I think this is\n[21:02] true because with the AI the unit tests\n[21:04] are so effective now the moment the AI\n[21:06] doesn't like write proper code in like\n[21:09] creates a small bug it gets an immediate\n[21:11] feedback immediately says like hey that\n[21:13] just broke it's like oh I forgot about\n[21:15] that and it fixes it and I think that's\n[21:17] true I think it and we and we discussed\n[21:20] about this for the last three podcasts\n[21:22] and I hope I've convinced you a little\n[21:23] bit but um but these\n[21:25] >> I'm still a little bit dubious about\n[21:27] even than that because in the last video\n[21:30] if you remember we we we observed that\n[21:32] the beads uh\n[21:34] >> no but failing we don't talk about beats\n[21:37] >> we don't we don't talk about beats here\n[21:40] I mean as as a we we talk about it as a\n[21:43] memory system not as a well tested\n[21:45] architecture because I told you in the\n[21:46] very early on I am very scared of\n[21:48] updating beats because I was just\n[21:50] looking at the change logs on the\n[21:51] releases and it was like fixing\n[21:54] merge conflict that corrupted all of\n[21:55] your issue task list I was like all the\n[21:57] I don't want to upgrade to [laughter]\n[22:00] [gasps] you know\n[22:01] >> I think I think DAX and open code were\n[22:04] were extoring their tests but I haven't\n[22:06] looked at open code GitHub\n[22:11] okay so I think so just let me talk\n[22:15] about\n[22:15] >> just to summarize our last chat\n[22:18] [snorts]\n[22:19] >> if you want to talk about the test part\n[22:21] because you just sent me the video of um\n[22:24] specdriven development from AI engineer\n[22:26] that was filmed. I looked at the date,\n[22:28] November 22, uh, from one of the\n[22:31] engineers that works on Kirro, the AWS\n[22:33] specdriven development IDE, and it was\n[22:36] very interesting because he dives into\n[22:38] exactly where do they trust or put LLM\n[22:41] flows and I know they because they do\n[22:44] property based testing and if you use\n[22:46] NodeJS, you can do that with fact check\n[22:48] or fast check. Sorry, fast check.\n[22:49] >> Yeah. Or hypothesis.\n[22:51] >> Hypothesis in Python he mentions. Yes.\n[22:53] >> So, I'm actually not very familiar with\n[22:55] this. This is so you do you know what\n[22:57] are you talking about then?\n[22:58] >> So because I was porting AWS CDK to\n[23:02] CDKTF for Terraform um or CDK for\n[23:05] Terraform there's several\n[23:08] um scenarios where they use property\n[23:10] based testing in their testing harness\n[23:13] that I also ported over. I think it was\n[23:16] in um the way that you define schedules\n[23:21] um for like scheduled rules or scheduled\n[23:24] things like if you if you if you do\n[23:25] cloudatch and you want to define a\n[23:27] schedule and you have different\n[23:30] constraints they do property based\n[23:31] testing in that part of the code and I I\n[23:34] never used it before and I was like what\n[23:35] is all this because then I have to I\n[23:36] have to install a fast check and I have\n[23:39] to learn how that works and and usually\n[23:40] I spend a lot of time trying to\n[23:42] understand how the tool works. and how\n[23:45] the property based testing works. But in\n[23:47] this case, the moment I installed it and\n[23:48] I copied over the to the the tests and\n[23:50] then I could verify that my uh Terraform\n[23:53] because it wasn't really testing\n[23:55] Terraform or cloud formation. It was\n[23:56] really testing the functionality of\n[23:58] defining a scheduled rule. So fast check\n[24:02] really cool. It was really nice to see\n[24:04] it run and I'm very excited. Um\n[24:06] >> okay. And so the fast check is a snap uh\n[24:09] sorry\n[24:10] >> is a NodeJS property based testing\n[24:11] framework. Okay,\n[24:12] >> I need to Okay, I want to see these\n[24:14] tests run in open code and I'm just\n[24:16] struggling to\n[24:19] just find out how they release.\n[24:22] Okay, how like I hate it when there's no\n[24:25] make file.\n[24:28] How do you do that? So one of the things\n[24:31] that they highlighted uh in the in the\n[24:33] specdriven development setup of Kirao is\n[24:35] they use procedural or like algorithm um\n[24:39] deterministic logic um to set up the\n[24:43] testing and the validation. So they\n[24:45] force you early on to define ears\n[24:47] formatted tests. So uh sorry um user\n[24:51] requirements and user stories\n[24:52] >> like cucumber type stuff or what are you\n[24:54] talking Yeah, behavior driven kind of\n[24:56] like\n[24:58] as a user when I do this I expect this\n[25:02] or something like that. So that they are\n[25:04] very strict in the in the way that they\n[25:05] want want the LLM to generate these and\n[25:08] they do a lot of like structural tests\n[25:09] against those because they evaluate that\n[25:12] and they generate property based testing\n[25:13] out of those markdown. So that's super\n[25:16] interesting, right? Because now you're\n[25:18] no longer asking an LLM to transcribe\n[25:19] the user story into some type of\n[25:21] testing. you're actually fundamentally\n[25:24] validating\n[25:26] um whatever the user and the LLM has\n[25:28] come to after you know brainstorming and\n[25:30] I think LLMs are great at that um help\n[25:32] us you know expand our horizon and think\n[25:35] and um and then really structurally\n[25:37] validate it and generate proper tests\n[25:39] about it u which you can trust so that\n[25:42] was a very nice uh aspect on it and then\n[25:44] the second part that he highlighted was\n[25:47] um in\n[25:48] >> I got to see this I mean do can you show\n[25:51] me these\n[25:52] Sorry, my brain is\n[25:55] not really working. So, do you have\n[25:58] maybe you can steal the screen share and\n[25:59] and show me these property based tests?\n[26:03] Do you have anything to add?\n[26:04] >> I didn't I don't he didn't show them in\n[26:05] the video. Um I would need to install\n[26:08] Kira and figure out where\n[26:09] >> Oh my god. So, we we're talking about\n[26:10] it. We don't need we\n[26:14] >> no because we are asking the question um\n[26:17] how can you trust the test that the LLM\n[26:19] is writing and the way that K is solving\n[26:22] it is by you know putting a lot of\n[26:23] formal mechanisms around it and that's\n[26:26] very exciting\n[26:27] >> this before I've never seen this before\n[26:30] >> yeah yeah blacksmith runs on um\n[26:33] depot.deb I'm actually investigating\n[26:35] that because I'm forking the Terraform\n[26:37] CDK and the biggest concern is the cost\n[26:39] of the runners because some of those uh\n[26:42] TypeScript um programs require eight\n[26:45] CPUs and 32 GB of memory when they are\n[26:48] running.\n[26:50] So I need to find a good uh GitHub\n[26:54] hosted runner alternative.\n[26:56] >> Okay. Do you use bun by the way? Cuz I\n[26:58] noticed Bun got bored.\n[26:59] >> Everyone's using bun now. Yeah, Antropic\n[27:01] acquired it. But like I'm struggling to\n[27:04] run this test here.\n[27:06] >> This is bun turbo type check.\n[27:09] >> Turbo is turbo repo.\n[27:11] >> Type check is just a package of JSON. So\n[27:14] turbo is a way to run uh tasks across\n[27:16] your monor repo and and with a cache. So\n[27:19] it will look at the input sha and then\n[27:22] if if the input sh didn't change it will\n[27:23] just use the cached result so it can\n[27:25] speed up your task. So turbo is just\n[27:27] going to run type check as a package of\n[27:30] JSON script.\n[27:31] >> Okay. Type check is just going to run\n[27:32] TSC and usually type check is just\n[27:34] running the TypeScript compiler. It's\n[27:36] not really\n[27:36] >> I can't work out how to run uh open code\n[27:38] tests.\n[27:39] >> Yeah.\n[27:40] >> Okay. Okay. If I can't work out maybe\n[27:42] let's have a look at the the GitHub at\n[27:44] least. Um Oh, sorry. I'm not sharing the\n[27:47] screen here.\n[27:51] I'm just I'm I'm\n[27:54] just\n[27:55] >> There are a lot of good things from the\n[27:56] video you shared me.\n[27:58] >> Oh, cool cool. But I need I'm a I'm a\n[28:02] visual learner. I need to see the bloody\n[28:04] test. I need I need to see the test. I\n[28:07] need to see it running.\n[28:10] I need to see the test failing. I need\n[28:12] to build\n[28:13] >> trust with the the test has value. You\n[28:15] know what I mean? It's like [snorts]\n[28:18] >> this is a journey. I maybe it's not\n[28:20] worth talking about now. I I kind of\n[28:21] want to turn the conversation back to um\n[28:25] Oh yeah. Like one thing that was very\n[28:28] good that\n[28:29] >> Yeah. from\n[28:30] >> from Theo's video is the Jven's paradox\n[28:33] which was actually mentioned by Simon\n[28:34] Willis\n[28:35] >> and I'm also a huge fan of Simon Willis.\n[28:38] >> Uh if you don't subscribe to him then\n[28:41] you're missing out. I really love his uh\n[28:43] his tool to um share uh so so this post\n[28:48] I wrote here is like I I use his UVX his\n[28:52] claude code transcripts into\n[28:54] >> there's another tool I wanted to show\n[28:55] you as well but\n[28:57] >> to pick out the session and then we sort\n[28:58] of share it as a team. So I think this\n[29:00] is like\n[29:02] >> this is like level one.\n[29:04] >> Yeah, this is very very level one. But\n[29:06] but but that's where we are at my\n[29:08] workplace. It's like it's like you know\n[29:11] the uh the different stakeholders and\n[29:14] the people are are basically in a\n[29:16] browser copy and pasting between that\n[29:18] and VS Code because the VS Code\n[29:21] organization is so locked down. Uh\n[29:24] anyway, so yeah paradox. Uh yeah, I'm\n[29:29] trying to get people I mean this is a\n[29:31] new argument for me and I I I'm I'm I'm\n[29:34] I believe it. I'm I'm behind it. It's\n[29:37] like if things are getting easier to do,\n[29:41] we're going to do more of it, not less\n[29:43] of it. I mean, I'm I'm I mean, I think\n[29:47] it's all public stuff. I have a I have a\n[29:50] guy that I I think I used to work with\n[29:52] him you um he was sort of posting some\n[29:57] like doomer stuff like it's like when\n[29:59] AGA comes along then prime real estate\n[30:01] is going to collapse and then I then I\n[30:04] asked him like why do you think that and\n[30:05] he says like with with heavy uh AGI job\n[30:09] displacement that uh people will become\n[30:13] on lower incomes and then people just\n[30:15] won't be able to to meet rent I think is\n[30:17] what he was trying to say and then\n[30:19] there'll be like a a spiral down where\n[30:22] everything sort of collapses\n[30:25] and then I do mention Jven's paradox in\n[30:28] that in that Twitter thread\n[30:32] and then he comes back by saying that's\n[30:34] reason by analogy. Analogy will break at\n[30:37] the limit.\n[30:38] It will hold for some time.\n[30:42] um as long as we're not bottlenecked by\n[30:44] energy supply. Uh you know, oh god. Um\n[30:49] but but with the cost of intelligence\n[30:51] labor approaching zero,\n[30:54] >> there'd be very few demands that supply\n[30:56] cannot meet. Lower incomes coupled with\n[30:59] lower prices would would would produce a\n[31:01] deflationary\n[31:03] cycle like unlike any we've ever seen.\n[31:08] Um and then then he quotes\n[31:12] uh this some I don't know where he gets\n[31:13] it exactly. We're going to hell before\n[31:15] everyone goes to heaven. I mean I get\n[31:17] that but at the same time I don't want\n[31:19] to get behind it. I I don't want to\n[31:23] think that's going to happen. I\n[31:26] I mean his def his his com his\n[31:28] combativeness\n[31:30] of like that Jven's paradox is going to\n[31:33] somehow break at the limit. I\n[31:37] h I don't think I I don't think so.\n[31:40] I mean I I don't want to think so\n[31:45] but um yeah regarding the the the the\n[31:49] fact that originally I always feel that\n[31:52] we are heavily subsidized they are\n[31:55] spending so much money and we are spend\n[31:57] we are actually using a lot more quote\n[31:59] than our quotas unless you're using API\n[32:02] keys which is dumb. Yeah, I mean I I\n[32:04] think things could get a bit more\n[32:06] restrictive in future. Like we're\n[32:08] definitely since since we're the\n[32:10] astronauts of of the AI, we we're\n[32:13] getting a free ride in some ways.\n[32:15] >> Yeah. Which to me feels like it's going\n[32:17] to become this elitists. Um only few\n[32:19] people can afford I think it's already a\n[32:21] little bit the case, right? There's only\n[32:23] a few people that are spending $600 a\n[32:25] month on three cloud max\n[32:28] plans and those guys are like, you know,\n[32:32] outputting. so much um that it's is if\n[32:37] like\n[32:38] >> yeah like Steve Jger is like elevated.\n[32:42] >> Yeah, he was he was he was very elevated\n[32:44] before with this stuff.\n[32:46] >> Yeah, I wanted to share something that I\n[32:48] said I would I would share a couple of\n[32:50] tools that are really cool. Um I want to\n[32:55] share my screen. Yeah.\n[32:56] >> Well, actually I'm not too sure about\n[32:58] this.\n[32:58] >> Can you see my screen?\n[33:00] >> Yep.\n[33:02] All right. So, you see here at the top I\n[33:04] have this little little bar that shows\n[33:07] like my codecs. I've not used much right\n[33:11] now. And I'm\n[33:11] >> Is that Is that a Is that an official\n[33:13] Codeex thing or is it some\n[33:15] >> No, it has Cloud here. Oh, so stupid. 5\n[33:18] seconds ago, Cloud was right there. But\n[33:21] I guess it I ran it on on uh another\n[33:23] one.\n[33:25] >> I'm not I'm not a huge fan of menu bars.\n[33:27] I always feel like they're just sucking\n[33:29] power. But [snorts] you find this one\n[33:30] useful.\n[33:33] >> Well, what did you\n[33:33] >> for me from what I do right now? Because\n[33:35] you kept asking how do you keep track of\n[33:37] the context and how do you keep track of\n[33:38] the usage? But I I don't care so much\n[33:41] about context because you get a warning\n[33:42] about 30% in. So I'm like, okay, that's\n[33:44] when I kill the session.\n[33:46] >> I probably have to cut this out. You I\n[33:48] think you you accidentally shared\n[33:50] someone's name there.\n[33:51] >> Where?\n[33:53] >> On the bottom left is a this\n[33:55] >> Oh, this one.\n[33:56] >> Yeah. No, he it's a book for about um AI\n[33:59] changes tools, but you still owe the\n[34:02] craft. I like that that uh page.\n[34:04] >> Okay. I'm just a bit nervous about\n[34:06] having to edit this video.\n[34:07] >> It's not a CV or anything. It's a book.\n[34:09] >> Oh, okay.\n[34:10] >> Um so I think you'll be happy book.\n[34:12] >> Oh, that's the author, I guess. Okay.\n[34:14] >> Yeah, he's the author and he works at\n[34:16] shopback in Singapore and he's kind of\n[34:19] as an evangelist talking a lot about the\n[34:20] tools because he's introducing them. I\n[34:22] think he's bit of an engineer.\n[34:23] >> So, is he is he bumping up AI? Ah, well,\n[34:26] this is the kind of\n[34:27] >> I don't know how how how we should\n[34:28] reason about it. Yeah. But the fact is\n[34:30] get back to\n[34:31] >> maybe share that with me if it's if it's\n[34:32] good cuz I need the reason it's open on\n[34:35] my on my laptop is I still haven't read\n[34:37] it.\n[34:37] >> All right. Right. But but just just just\n[34:40] to summarize where I am, Vincent, I need\n[34:42] to\n[34:43] >> to basically um become an AI mascot in\n[34:48] my company without\n[34:50] >> Yeah, these are definitely the recovery\n[34:52] codes you should cut out.\n[34:54] >> [laughter]\n[34:54] >> Thanks.\n[34:57] Uh, okay. Hold it. Do I I need to really\n[35:00] cut that out. Okay, let me just make a\n[35:02] so I can find it. Cut.\n[35:07] >> Your name escort. You can start from\n[35:08] there.\n[35:13] >> Okay. What were you showing me? What\n[35:15] were you showing me? You showing me\n[35:19] >> Hold on.\n[35:20] >> Oh, you were showing me this like\n[35:22] codeex. uh you're showing me this menu\n[35:24] bar thing\n[35:27] you're you're flexing to the the podcast\n[35:30] listeners or pe the viewers like yeah\n[35:33] I've got I'm burnt I'm burnt through a\n[35:36] billion tokens in the last 24 hours\n[35:39] stuff that you wouldn't couldn't afford\n[35:41] or you couldn't get through your company\n[35:43] no that's where we were we were talking\n[35:45] about how it's like an elitist right but\n[35:47] that made me realize I have this little\n[35:49] bar here at the top that shows you how\n[35:51] much codeex how cloud and then how much\n[35:54] Gemini I've used so far.\n[35:57] >> How much of the Earth you've destroyed?\n[35:59] >> Yeah, that's So people are doing these\n[36:01] Instagram\n[36:02] >> $500.\n[36:04] >> No,\n[36:06] >> that's API calls for sure because I only\n[36:09] pay $20 a month. So So just to show that\n[36:12] if you pay API calls, it's a bit silly\n[36:14] because they cost a lot of money. But if\n[36:16] you use something like um a $20\n[36:19] subscription, you get that in mind.\n[36:22] But still actually these these\n[36:24] >> but this is this is this is wrong\n[36:26] because this is probably because I\n[36:28] haven't spent extra usage 500\n[36:29] >> as a consultant\n[36:31] people people it's it's sometimes eye\n[36:34] watering but it's not unusual to see\n[36:37] people being build you know thousand\n[36:39] $1,000 US a day right for a consultant\n[36:44] and and then and then I at the same time\n[36:47] I get a bit you know I I shout out when\n[36:50] I see someone that has spent $600 on\n[36:53] Claude in a month. Of course,\n[36:59] in real terms, AI is incredibly more\n[37:02] efficient than a than a consultant.\n[37:05] [snorts] Okay, maybe I have to cut that\n[37:07] out.\n[37:09] Yeah, I'm trying to find So, this is um\n[37:11] cloud cuz you were showing a way to\n[37:14] share cloud sessions. You can take a\n[37:16] session and you can create a nice web\n[37:18] page from it. Yeah. Using Simon Willis's\n[37:20] tool.\n[37:21] >> Yeah, I can link to the my blog.\n[37:23] >> And then there's this thing called the\n[37:25] the cloud um I don't know what it stands\n[37:28] for like assistant session reviewer and\n[37:31] it's Cass\n[37:33] and it you run an indexer across your\n[37:36] cloud session directory and it will it's\n[37:38] using oh it's using Rust so it must be\n[37:40] fast, right? Okay.\n[37:42] >> Oh, come on. This is trivial stuff, but\n[37:44] you could do this in shell.\n[37:46] >> No, but the fact is that that like\n[37:51] >> Okay. So, so you're basically going\n[37:53] across all your conversations.\n[37:56] >> Yeah. Across everything and you can type\n[37:58] like a small little like a single word\n[38:00] and it will find all of them. I think\n[38:02] it's doing a fuzzy search. I'm not sure.\n[38:03] But my indexer has an error apparent on\n[38:05] its another problem is\n[38:07] >> so so when it comes to these transcripts\n[38:09] I feel like um there needs to be a tool\n[38:13] to say like\n[38:15] um to to rate to rate the transcripts\n[38:19] right like like this was a really good\n[38:21] session this this session sucked what\n[38:24] went wrong here what went right here you\n[38:26] know these these sort of like metadata\n[38:29] so we have a way of sharing transcripts\n[38:31] but we don't have a great way\n[38:32] >> oh look at even works across open code\n[38:34] and codex in Gemini.\n[38:36] >> Yeah. Nice. So we don't have we don't\n[38:38] have a nice way of of really\n[38:42] learning as a human how to interact with\n[38:44] AI. I feel because if we if we feed\n[38:47] these transcripts back into AI and\n[38:49] asking how to improve I think that I'm\n[38:52] not too sure it might work but\n[38:55] >> yeah but that's not\n[38:56] >> but I'm I'm talking about upskilling\n[38:57] teams getting getting people more to\n[39:01] build trust with the and building shared\n[39:04] prompts and things like that.\n[39:05] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I'm this\n[39:07] is what I'm trying to do at work.\n[39:11] >> So, this is one thing that they\n[39:12] highlight in um somebody asked a\n[39:15] question in the KO talk saying, \"Can I\n[39:18] customize the templates and the prompts\n[39:20] and the workflow and they're like they\n[39:23] are over here?\" I don't remember the\n[39:24] answer, but it it seemed like given the\n[39:27] way that they are so structured, I think\n[39:28] it's hard for you to change those\n[39:30] things. And um I definitely feel that\n[39:36] those templates, those workflows, like I\n[39:38] try to use speckit to set up some type\n[39:40] of uh ADR. So it's funny because speckit\n[39:43] is ADR in a way kind not really exactly\n[39:46] the same, but it's in a way you're\n[39:47] capturing like a decision\n[39:49] record, right? Um, so I was trying to\n[39:52] ask specit to create a decision record\n[39:54] and it couldn't really get it because\n[39:56] like, oh, you're building a program. So,\n[39:58] and I was like, yeah, no, but we're\n[39:59] using LLMs. I was like, oh, so you're\n[40:01] building a program that um is going to,\n[40:04] you know, you know, you're going to call\n[40:06] out to the open API and and I was like,\n[40:08] no, no, no. I'm trying to do something.\n[40:10] [laughter] So, it was really uh really\n[40:12] difficult to get it to do kind of like\n[40:14] meta meta spec type of things like I\n[40:17] want you to create a library of prompts\n[40:19] to use for my community planning\n[40:21] sessions and things like that. It was\n[40:23] like huh I only know how to create a\n[40:25] program just like so you want me to\n[40:27] create a program to run your community\n[40:29] meetings? No, no, that's not what I\n[40:30] want. So, it was um so yes, you need to\n[40:33] be able to modify these workflows. Uh I\n[40:35] tried conductor first by the way to have\n[40:37] a feel of it.\n[40:39] >> Oh, yeah. Oh,\n[40:40] >> did you have a good experience like I\n[40:41] did?\n[40:43] >> No, actually both conductor even though\n[40:46] in the in the product design and\n[40:48] definition I said very clearly like what\n[40:51] we're building here is a way to like a a\n[40:55] type of a process for the repository. I\n[40:58] want to build a pro. So it's a repo for\n[41:00] keeping track of decisions and proposals\n[41:02] and spec and so on and and um no didn't\n[41:06] go for that. Again, probably not the\n[41:08] right project for it. But yeah, other\n[41:09] than that, conductor was pretty cool. I\n[41:11] I feel it actually kept kept Gemini\n[41:13] going like uh I thought at some point\n[41:15] when I finished with all of the upfront\n[41:17] planning, Gemini went in a loop and for\n[41:20] a significant amount of time kept going.\n[41:22] I've never seen Gemini keep going like\n[41:23] that uh in a while. Have you had the\n[41:26] same experience with conductor like\n[41:28] that? It can keep keep Gemini going a\n[41:30] bit like\n[41:30] >> Well, it was a good experience. So I\n[41:32] guess I I don't I mean it was a week ago\n[41:36] if not more. So I guess I guess it was\n[41:39] doing its thing. Yeah, I guess it was\n[41:41] doing it thing. [snorts] Oh, okay. You\n[41:44] know what? I need the weather is\n[41:45] actually good right now. It's not\n[41:47] raining. I feel like I need to wash my\n[41:49] car and run around while there's some\n[41:52] sunlight. So I think I'm going to end\n[41:54] the conversation a bit early if you\n[41:56] don't mind. I still think I still think\n[41:58] what we talked about was valuable. I\n[42:00] don't know if if we I guess at this\n[42:03] point I would like to engage anyone\n[42:04] who's listening to please comment below\n[42:07] and uh chime in with your thoughts\n[42:10] around making AI uh I mean are you\n[42:14] positive about AI and things like that\n[42:16] or another interesting thing that Theo\n[42:18] did he had like a little poll on his\n[42:19] video to say that do you think Opus or\n[42:22] do you think Claude is outputting better\n[42:23] code than you are at this point and I\n[42:26] think it was like 65%\n[42:29] agree agreed that Claude is already\n[42:31] better than them at coding, which I\n[42:34] thought was interesting. And to be\n[42:35] honest, I agree. Like I don't know how\n[42:37] you feel. Me too.\n[42:38] >> Yeah, me too. I think it's better\n[42:39] because it's better than me.\n[42:43] >> Uh it's more like it has a broader\n[42:47] knowledge base like it can produce code\n[42:49] for a broader set of things that I don't\n[42:52] know.\n[42:53] >> Yeah. But even if I ask it to produce Go\n[42:55] code or or code or languages I know\n[42:58] quite well, I I don't I think it's\n[43:00] pretty okay.\n[43:01] >> No, but I liked Steve's take saying that\n[43:04] it's way better at Go than at\n[43:05] Typescript. I always felt TypeScript is\n[43:07] perfect because it gives you the\n[43:08] structure and the schemas, but Steve\n[43:10] says types is TypeScript is way too you\n[43:12] can do way too fancy things with types\n[43:14] and TypeScript and Go is just really\n[43:16] down to the you know straightforward. So\n[43:19] so AI is better with Go. There there's\n[43:21] some arguments made I think oh I can't I\n[43:24] can't remember his name now uh the\n[43:26] educator guy he was who makes some\n[43:28] typescript courses he was arguing that\n[43:30] types and AI go well together because\n[43:33] you want those that that that test\n[43:35] >> I always feel like that but Steve Jger\n[43:37] was saying that that he he he rewrote\n[43:38] gas\n[43:39] >> typescript was was sucks in that regard\n[43:42] >> he says it's it's a token waste it's\n[43:44] it's generating a ton of tokens that\n[43:46] don't really do much and uh and with\n[43:49] >> code is so much cleaner\n[43:50] and direct although that I like what I\n[43:53] like with go is this very um you know\n[43:55] write everything twice mentality of go\n[43:58] which is like don't over generalize no\n[44:01] generics for ages don't like just\n[44:03] rewrite the code rewrite the functions\n[44:05] >> I still I still don't even quite\n[44:06] understand generics I mean I don't use\n[44:08] them so maybe I'm missing out\n[44:11] >> I I did originally when I was writing\n[44:13] code golang but when I asked the llam to\n[44:15] write I I go like yeah don't like I\n[44:18] don't mind it being duplicated in\n[44:20] several places cuz I'm like\n[44:22] >> Yeah, exactly. It's cheap. Yeah. To do\n[44:25] all the different uh\n[44:26] >> you need to maintain it. It's going to\n[44:27] figure out\n[44:28] >> switches and all that sort of stuff.\n[44:29] Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I mean, go it. I\n[44:33] mean, I'm feeling pretty pretty uh #\n[44:38] uh what do you call it? Inspired #\n[44:40] grateful. because I know Go better than\n[44:43] most people and uh and I know AI better\n[44:47] than most people in some ways and\n[44:48] everything everything's coming together\n[44:51] really nicely for me. I feel and I'm\n[44:53] touching wood here. is like everything's\n[44:55] going well except maybe my pay packet.\n[44:59] But uh\n[45:02] you also did one final uh because the\n[45:04] whole tailwind laying off 75% of staff\n[45:06] and then people saying well well if your\n[45:08] business model was like what was their\n[45:10] business model right how that they got\n[45:12] disrupted. I don't know if you know\n[45:14] about this whole Tailwind scenario.\n[45:16] >> Oh yeah I didn't I did notice that was\n[45:17] that was interesting. Uh I think I\n[45:21] didn't read the whole post and he also\n[45:22] made a podcast himself, right? Where\n[45:24] he's walking his\n[45:25] >> I read the post and I listened to the\n[45:26] whole podcast.\n[45:27] >> Oh, really? So you probably have more\n[45:28] details, but but my my uh what do you\n[45:31] call it? Headline reading interpretation\n[45:33] was that was that um yeah the LLM was\n[45:38] was was taking their business away\n[45:40] because uh you didn't need to use\n[45:42] Tailwind and its abstractions I suppose\n[45:45] to do to work with CSS. You can just get\n[45:48] Claude to do it.\n[45:50] >> Yeah.\n[45:50] >> And then it boiled down also to the\n[45:52] website. So I think there's this llm.ext\n[45:55] and they removed it because they don't\n[45:57] want to\n[45:58] >> the thing that triggered it is somebody\n[46:00] went I'm going to here's a pull request\n[46:02] to add the llm.txt to your docs.\n[46:05] >> And he was I'm sorry but I have to\n[46:07] decline this. I just had to lay out 75%\n[46:09] because the docs are our only funnel and\n[46:12] nobody's reading them because the LLMs\n[46:14] are just generating code. Nobody's\n[46:15] reading our docs anymore. And it's how\n[46:17] we we funnel our business. We've got 80%\n[46:19] down uh in revenue. Um for you know was\n[46:23] it 80% down in traffic through through\n[46:26] uh those funnels. So he's measuring\n[46:27] those different you know ways that they\n[46:30] are driving business right and and a lot\n[46:32] of discussions\n[46:33] >> stack overflow problem in a way but\n[46:35] whatever it's different. Yeah. Uh so a\n[46:38] lot of people were saying like from\n[46:39] Tailwind they realized as a as a an\n[46:43] expert um I have a network and people\n[46:47] come to me to and and that's how I get\n[46:50] jobs but that all falls away with AI. Uh\n[46:53] and and then some some of the uh um he\n[46:58] says I've been sponsoring Tailwind for a\n[47:00] long time. Love what they do. I learned\n[47:01] a lot from them. So in his video was\n[47:03] more like highlighting all the good work\n[47:04] that they've done and he shared like\n[47:06] there's this even if you are using an\n[47:08] LLM reading their design um you know\n[47:11] guides like they have they written a\n[47:12] book on how to do the UX which is not\n[47:15] just about the CSS but really about like\n[47:17] how to build uh UX. He says that's a\n[47:20] really good book then you should really\n[47:21] read it and he's also encouraging people\n[47:23] to sponsor them.\n[47:24] >> Yeah.\n[47:25] >> Yeah. But that I mean I'm sponsoring is\n[47:28] always not a solution right? You need a\n[47:31] viable business business model. If their\n[47:34] business model is upselling through\n[47:36] their docs, yeah, they're in problem. I\n[47:37] mean, and interestingly, Charlie from\n[47:39] the Astro Project mentioned that that\n[47:42] they have LLM's text, but they also have\n[47:45] a similar they're they're in the similar\n[47:47] boat\n[47:48] >> because they need to upsell their other\n[47:51] um\n[47:52] >> they're hosting, I guess. Oh, they have\n[47:54] some um\n[47:57] what is there? I can't even remember\n[47:58] what they're business. [snorts]\n[48:01] >> There's a there's a there's a product\n[48:02] that I think they were working on. Oh,\n[48:04] this Pyx thing.\n[48:06] >> I think that's\n[48:08] >> going to be uh a paid for thing.\n[48:12] >> That's like Dino then. Dino and Bun like\n[48:15] reinventing the packaging. Well, not\n[48:16] Bun, but Dino reinventing the packaging.\n[48:18] So, so you get the point that everything\n[48:21] could just Yeah, they're in the similar\n[48:23] boat. Okay. Anyway, I'm I'm interrupting\n[48:25] I'm interrupting you.\n[48:28] >> No, the other thing that Tio said is as\n[48:30] a as a business, if you let LLM generate\n[48:32] your code, go check the dependencies and\n[48:34] see if you can go sponsor them like if\n[48:37] but but to me it seems like the real\n[48:39] solution is is ads, right? This is how\n[48:41] Warp they say like we're giving you Opus\n[48:44] 4 access for a fraction of the cost\n[48:46] because they put\n[48:47] >> no one's going to read the docs ads. How\n[48:50] you\n[48:50] >> Yeah. Because ultimately inside the docs\n[48:52] are ads. Like if you like to if you like\n[48:53] this here's our our offering, right? So\n[48:56] if you translate it, nobody's going to\n[48:58] the dogs. It means that those ads no\n[49:00] longer live with the dogs, but they must\n[49:02] be surfaced by the LM somehow, right?\n[49:04] And Warp's uh operating model is like we\n[49:07] give cheap AI access in our terminal by\n[49:11] serving you ads and that's like\n[49:14] and and you know if OpenAI would\n[49:16] introduce that you know the alterate is\n[49:18] already created but it's the only way\n[49:19] like if OpenAI can semantically\n[49:22] >> any business that requires ads now I\n[49:24] guess with with LLMs in the mix LLMs are\n[49:27] filtering out the ads\n[49:29] >> so any business model that relies on ads\n[49:31] is basically in trouble here and it\n[49:32] probably includes includes Google.\n[49:34] >> Google of course. Yeah, Google. Google\n[49:36] had a big re wakeup call. They had all\n[49:38] hands on deck\n[49:39] >> uh early in the in the Chad GPT saga.\n[49:42] >> So what is what is Google's response\n[49:45] there\n[49:47] >> to become a leader because they have put\n[49:48] so much money. They have their own TPUs.\n[49:50] They build their own Gemini CLI. They\n[49:52] they become an LLM platform.\n[49:54] >> But like okay, go going back to\n[49:57] Tailwind. I mean don't say sponsorship\n[49:59] is the answer because it's not. What is\n[50:02] Vincent? How do you think they're gonna\n[50:04] come out of this or how how is Astral\n[50:06] going to come out of this?\n[50:08] >> I think if the LLMs I guess it's it's\n[50:12] the whole problem with LLM's not giving\n[50:14] attribution, right? If there's a way for\n[50:16] LLMs to give better attribution and it's\n[50:20] like I'm you know imagine that while\n[50:22] it's generating your website it goes and\n[50:24] by the way there's a sale on Tailwind\n[50:26] right now. [laughter]\n[50:28] I'm I'm using Tailwind to build your\n[50:30] website. No. Um,\n[50:32] >> that sounds like another weird form of\n[50:35] advertising which sounds insane.\n[50:37] >> It would be funny if if if you're try if\n[50:39] you're using the MCP or you're\n[50:40] troubleshooting the issue and you're\n[50:42] going like, you know, it's still not\n[50:44] looking right. There's still an\n[50:45] overlaying bug. It just stops. I just\n[50:47] said, go to the Tailwind team, dude.\n[50:49] Like, [laughter] go ask them to fix to\n[50:51] help you fix it.\n[50:52] >> Pay them. Um, cuz I don't have the\n[50:54] answer here. [laughter]\n[50:55] >> Yeah.\n[50:58] >> Oh god. I think if a company is smart\n[51:00] and and onropic is smart because they\n[51:02] did like the double limits usage limits\n[51:04] for for the whole Christmas holiday that\n[51:06] was a gigantic success. Look at how many\n[51:09] people tried it out. They were like I\n[51:10] got so much done and I'm 100% in on this\n[51:12] right now. I actually upgraded to $100.\n[51:15] >> They just they're like drug dealers,\n[51:17] aren't they?\n[51:18] >> Yeah. So if there's if if Antropic is\n[51:20] listening, Boris, [laughter]\n[51:22] >> if they're smart, what they're going to\n[51:24] do is they're going to make\n[51:25] >> more correct.\n[51:26] >> Yeah. like loop detected. Um, please\n[51:30] like based on the context it looks like\n[51:32] like Clippy pops up. Looks like you're\n[51:35] trying to fix a wind a tailwind issue.\n[51:37] [laughter]\n[51:38] Here's the tailwind guys website.\n[51:40] >> No, I think your proposal I mean it's\n[51:44] frankly\n[51:44] >> ads are coming. Ads are coming. I think\n[51:47] this is\n[51:47] >> there's got to be a better Okay,\n[51:49] >> I'm going to do a hot take. Hot take\n[51:50] 2026 hot take from Vincent. Ads in your\n[51:54] LLMs this year. Guaranteed warp's\n[51:58] already there. So I already what? Not\n[51:59] except for warp. Let's talk.\n[52:01] >> Arguably there already ads like when you\n[52:03] run claude it gives you like a tip. Try\n[52:05] this mobile experience. Try this.\n[52:07] >> But it's always there. It's always like\n[52:09] use our our designer plugin for better\n[52:12] web design. What about it goes like use\n[52:16] the Tailwind MCP subscription only $5 a\n[52:19] month. [laughter]\n[52:20] Okay. Bye. Go wash your car.\n[52:24] Let's see how many people hate comments.\n[52:26] [snorts]\n[52:26] >> Okay, please please please rate the\n[52:28] podcast. Please comment below. Please\n[52:32] tell me how we tell us how we can\n[52:34] improve. Actually, I did get feedback\n[52:36] from from from Swix, but the the\n[52:39] Riverside thing looks a bit too\n[52:41] expensive for me at least. It's like £24\n[52:43] a month\n[52:45] >> to to improve the quality. I was like, I\n[52:47] don't want to spend money.\n[52:50] >> Everything's improving except my pay\n[52:51] packet.\n[52:54] Uh, I did earn I Oh, yeah. I should I\n[52:56] should note maybe I can give you access\n[52:58] to my YouTube studio, but I think I I've\n[53:01] earned two pound\n[53:03] thanks to this whole podcast series. So,\n[53:05] thanks Vincent for coming on the show.\n[53:06] >> That's two pound off for a family of\n[53:08] four.\n[53:10] >> Two pound. I I'll I think I'll can buy\n[53:12] you a coffee when I see you in Vietnam\n[53:14] or something.\n[53:14] >> Yeah. Come to Vietnam. You can feast\n[53:17] >> for exactly one meal.\n[53:19] >> Wow. [laughter]\n[53:21] Yeah, I that's probably the real issue\n[53:24] that we should have talked about is how\n[53:26] people's pay because Madu Shan who I was\n[53:29] chatting to on X, he was right to point\n[53:32] out that that people's income is not\n[53:34] improving.\n[53:36] >> Okay.\n[53:37] >> Yeah. [clears throat]\n[53:38] >> Okay. See you guys.\n[53:40] >> See you.\n[53:40] >> See you guys. Oh my god. I say you guys.\n[53:43] Sorry. So, see you Vincent.\n[53:44] >> Comment below. Bye.\n[53:47] >> You guys and girls. Come on.\n[53:49] >> Oh yeah. Sorry.",

Do not mention or acknowledge them, and do not say you skipped or ignored anything. Avoid sponsor/ad/promo language, brand names like Squarespace, or CTA phrases like discount code. Treat them as if they do not exist. If a slide segment is purely sponsor/ad content, leave that slide marker with no text.\nWrite a detailed summary that captures the main points, supporting facts, and concrete numbers or quotes when present.\nUse the slide format below. Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 65,075 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line. Use straight quotation marks (no curly) as needed. If no suitable line exists, omit excerpts. Never include ad/sponsor/boilerplate excerpts and do not mention them.\nBase everything strictly on the provided content and never invent details.\nFinal check: remove any sponsor/ad references or mentions of skipping/ignoring content. Ensure excerpts (if any) are italicized and use only straight quotes.\nFinal check for slides: every [slide:N] must be immediately followed by a line that starts with \"## \". Remove any \"Title:\" or \"Slide\" label lines.\nYou are not given any quotes from people who shared this link.

There was a huge\nstorm in the UK actually and I'm and I\npretty much drove well, not through it,\nbut like I stopped off at my sisters and\nthen I and then when it passed, I drove\nafter it. So, I got to see the beginning\nof it and the and the after of it. So,\nit was a pretty epic storm.\n>> Have you seen that kite surfing video?\n[clears throat] There was like\n>> in Israel\n>> during a storm\n>> there was like a thermal vortex like a\nlittle cyclone and some kite surfers got\ncaught into it and one guy he went like\nsuper high but he was able to eject when\nhe was lowered to the ground. The other\nguy he got dragged onto rocks and died.\nSo it was um it's been posted like four\nor five times on Reddit. Maybe because I\nlike to kite surfer so I see it.\n>> It's pretty bad. But yeah, you're\ntalking about the storm reminded me.\nSorry you were saying after the storm.\nUh but I mean to be honest we were not\nimpacted. But one thing that makes me\nnervous is that um I think last year was\nit the year before we had a storm durag\nand we were out of power for like two 47\nhours. Is that two days almost?\nAnd it was pretty terrible because\nwithout power we cannot actually power\nour oil\nor gas heating systems.\n>> Basically [snorts]\nIt really goes to hell here very\nquickly. And uh and funny and the other\nthing that really irritates me is that\nlike as a South African if I'm actually\nused to the power to go to go out but\nthe infrastructure the mobile\ninfrastructure it always has like a huge\nbackup. Your audio just switched\n>> from what to what?\n>> I don't know the audio. Maybe when you\nwhen you moved closer. Maybe it's it's\n>> Oh, you know what? I think I I knocked\nout the bloody\nuh RX or something.\n>> Yeah. Test.\n>> No, when you said that about um you\ncouldn't turn on your electric like\ncooking or or anything. When I wanted I\ncame to Vietnam, I I really hated those\ngas cookers.\n>> Oh, yeah. But now you love them.\n>> And and the fire. I don't like it\nbecause I see videos of these gas\ncanisters exploding and things like\nthat. And I was begging my um my wife to\nget like um an electric cooker and she's\nlike, \"No way.\" You know, there's going\nto be a power outage and we can't cook.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. [snorts] So we\nhave we have like a little Korean set\nand those little butane canisters for\nfor for these occasions.\n>> But yeah, going back to the the\ninfrastructure cuz this is the AI\ninfrastructure podcast.\n>> Yeah.\n>> In South Africa, the infrastructure is\nvery robust.\nBut when the power goes out here in uh\nyou know 5 minutes later my 4G signal\ndisappears and then\n>> really and yeah like none of the none of\nthe masts in England have backup power.\nMaybe they do it out in like London, but\naround here in the southwest, none have\nbackup power. [snorts]\n>> You weren't afraid it was going to be\nlike like a Venezuela incident. They\ntake out the the power in the city and\nnext thing you know, your prime minister\nis on a plane back to the US.\n>> Well, yeah. Well, the resiliency factor\nin in UK and I do think it's related to\nthe well to the mobile infrastructure is\nis very poor actually. So if the if any\nRussians are listening to this\n>> Yeah.\n>> now you know\n>> but I know they take London in in u\nwhat's this movie with um Edge with Tom\nCruz\nuh where he brings tomorrow.\n>> Yeah, tomorrow's edge. [gasps]\n>> They take London very quickly as soon as\nthe the beach uh battle was lost.\n[laughter]\n>> Tomorrow's I watched the movie like four\nor five times. I know it's maybe because\nyou like and you like games. Anyway,\n>> the Anyway,\n>> one of the things I wanted to that was\njust banging around my head after being\nat on on site\num the last couple of days was that\non on one on one side I have you know\nsince I'm a middle manager I don't know\nhow you feel you are in in the industry\nbut I mean I do feel like I'm a very\nhands-on middle manager but nonetheless\nI'm a middle manager since I'm my middle\nmanager. I have I have the the executive\nsort of asking me, \"Hey, Kai, um how's\nthis AI thing going? Um it makes people\nmore productive, right? It it's how much\nmore productive 100 100% 200% how can\nyou just tell can you build a case study\nfor me to show how how more productive\nyou are with AI?\" And this is in that\nsaid and the AI roller in this\nparticular customer is incredibly\nfrustrating and bad because they disable\nuh all the good models. So that I got on\none hand I've got the these sort of\nquestions and then and then for the sort\nof the colleagues sort of um that I work\nwith\nmany of them are actually um quite\nnervous about the future and um okay I'm\nexaggerating here when they when they\nwhen I think in my in the in the notes I\ncall them doomers but like a lot of\npeople say like are basically like uh\nsaying to me that like oh um AI isn't\ngoing to make me um you know twice as\neffective. And it's absolute [ __ ]\nthat management are are coming up with\nthese things as an excuse to uh reorg\nand lay off people. But that's the way\nthey feel and and and and\nI'm in the middle and I don't know and\nmy feeling is is is just trying to be\nwell I am a positive I like to think I'm\na positive person. Some some people\nmight disagree with with with that\nsentiment, but like I'm very excited\nabout the future. I am so excited, but\nat the same time, like I can't really\nlike my my fun factor that we have in\nour little podcast chats, I does that\ntranslate to a 200% productivity? I I I\nI am reluctant to say that. and and at\nthe same time I'm like how do I make how\ndo I make people more positive who are\naround me or or you know\n>> report to me you know what I mean\n>> okay let's because you touched on like\nfive different points I think the first\none you mentioned is how do you me\nmeasure productivity and that's all\nabout the devops accelerate report right\ndora metrics how many times do you\ndeploy how long product feature to go to\nproduction\n>> let's be real a lot of these dora\nmetrics aren't aren't extremely well\nrecorded and and things like that and\nthey're very hard to\n>> No, no, there are so we implemented the\nDora metrics well me uh a a colleague of\nmine implemented the Dora metrics as a\nprevious company and you you have four\nclear metrics that are well defined of\nwhat you need to measure and they are\nthe key I can argue with you but carry\non\n>> and like meantime between failure is is\noften something that's quite contentious\nI\nIt's you're the matter is you need to\nmeasure where you are and then measure\nthe improvements, right? So it's about\ntaking snapshots. It's about agreeing.\nYeah, sure.\nThey identified these are the metrics\nthat correlate to productive um\ncompanies or companies that are\nsuccessful according to the research\nthat they've been doing sponsored by\nGoogle over several years looking at\nmany different companies and across\ndifferent industries and different\nstyles of companies maturity and all and\nthey said look those four metrics start\nmeasuring them. So then this the fact is\nsource of truth. Where do I get this\ninformation? How exactly do I measure\nthat for this particular team for this\nparticular product, right? Um where does\nthe the you know how long does it take\nfor a feature to be from specified down\nto production and and how do I measure\nthat you know do I go to GitHub? Is\nthere like a certain Jira ticket\nattached to the pull request and can I\nsee when the when the Jira is you know\nprogressing along the different stages\nand when the is the mer is a branch\nmerged and the release tech and so on\nright so that was the exercise really at\nmy previous company that um a part of\nthe team did and they started having\nsnapshots for every team the data team\nthe cloud team the app team you know the\niPad app team\n>> snapshots by team yeah\n>> yeah and then they start showing okay\nthis team's quite well on the way on the\non their on their journey uh after one\nmonth two months uh improvements and so\non. So then I think if you started doing\nthose snapshots early before the AI\nadoption you can definitely you know\ncompare this team has heavily\n>> I mean I wish I wish it was that easy\nbut maybe I'm just being making coming\nup with excuses but like\n>> yeah it really comes down to just doing\nlike breaking it down in small steps and\ndoing it. I hate I have some colleagues\nthat are constantly going about what if\nyes we have to understand the problem so\nwe can well define the solution but at\nthe same time if we spend days arguing\nback and forth about what is that of how\nit really works until like put it then\nyou know spin up I'm very quick to spin\nup a docker compos cluster with the\ndifferent uh you know like the engineext\nand whatever like this was particularly\nabout rate limiting or or about shared\nmemory right using a swap\n>> rate limiting I I I worked on an enginex\nrate limiting uh uh module back a couple\nof gigs ago.\n>> Yeah,\n>> we should.\n>> So, the thing is I hate I hate these\nvery theoretical like I want a a very\nearly MVP definition. What do we need to\ndo to to prove some of this? And that's\nwhat the guy in in in in that comp in\nthe company I worked for did. He went\nwith like a pre-prepared\nuh solution like pop flash or pop dog\nsomething. It's not pop dog because\nthat's the train in in in in\nCounterstrike. [laughter]\nuh with it's like pop up. So something\nlike that. Anyway,\n>> but like okay I\n>> was a very clear path very didn't take\nlong took quick. Okay, you're talking\nabout making some stone cold\nmeasurements and you're right. You're\nabsolutely right.\n>> But I had a second point and and I think\nthat the objective, but like how do you\ndeal with people's, you know, vibes, you\nknow, that's\n>> Yeah. So people second thing, right?\nFirst thing is the metrics because this\nis the same problem that we always face\nas a platform team where we're not\ndirectly um valued against the business\nand we need to our metrics really come\ndown to the Dora metrics, right? we need\nto optimize for those and we need to\nprove that our efforts and our projects\noptimize those metrics. So that's how\nyou can attach value to a platform team\naside from constantly asking them to to\n>> So have you honestly had success? So\nthis is how you've defended your DevOps\nuh work in the past by saying like uh\nyou know hey we are delivering uh faster\nthanks to my work. I mean or you or you\njust playing this by the book?\n>> No. Um\n>> do you have a real case study?\n>> Yeah, but I found so the team that I was\nin was doing this. I think I stayed for\n6 months and then I left. [laughter] Um\nbecause I wanted I thought there was\nfundamentally something wrong with the\nway that the platform was was being\ndeveloped and I wanted instead of\nconstantly being forced to go and you\nknow do little bandates on the different\nteams infrastructure I wanted to have a\nproper design but I've also learned that\nthat is not really something um but\nanyway so I've seen they because there\nwas a very strong culture of sharing\nresults in that company so there was\nalways this big all all hands-on\nmeetings where every team presented the\nresults. So, the team presented those\ndashboards, but I did think a lot of\nthose numbers were being fudged for\nexample.\n>> Oh, yeah, of course. Oh my god. I was\nThat's what I was going to say. I mean,\nif if you have a culture of doing line\ngraphs, it's going to be so bad.\n>> Yeah. No, but also like there was this\ninitiative to to increase the AWS\nresource tagging and one approach was to\nadd tags and tax policies around the\ninfrastructure as code so that they are\nbeing measured and pull requests are\nbeing uh blocked until tag tag coverage\nimproves and so on until beatings will\ncontinue until the memorial improves.\n[laughter] Anyway, um but in those cases\n>> will continue. I've never heard that one\nbut it's quite hilarious. It's I think\nit's from Montipython not uh you know um\nyeah\n>> will continue until the moral improves.\nYeah. So [laughter] but in this case\nthey actually went through manually and\nadded tags all over the place and it was\njustified because some of the resources\nwere not under IC. But to be honest I\nthink it was just a a hack because they\nwere under IC and you just had to go put\nit just to present the report like yeah\nwe improved tech coverage from 20% to\n60%. like, \"Okay, fuck.\"\n>> I hate sitting in these meetings because\nI'm just like thinking, \"Oh my god, this\nis bullshit.\" But if I say something,\nthen everyone's going to think I'm the\nbiggest [ __ ] in the room.\n>> Yeah, I do say some things. But I've\nlearned to say those things not in\npublic channels anymore. [laughter]\n>> But I go [snorts] to people, I say like\nthat's not right. You just added the\ntags manually.\n>> Private meetings will resume.\n[laughter] So, but then the second part\nyou touched on is about the human aspect\nlike because yes sure you can measure a\nteam per team and you can measure those\nmetrics but this is something that Jean\nKim and Steve Jagger touched on in their\ntalk right when they said like they had\na problem in OpenAI um in where how can\nyou compare somebody that has fully\nadopted LLM versus someone who hasn't\nbecause if they looked at at the\ntraditional metrics someone who has\nadopted AI is doing a lot better and and\nso\n>> well they say that and they don't really\ntell you\n>> because they sell it also, right?\n>> Yeah. And this is the this is the\nfrustrating thing is like, oh yeah,\nthey're much better. They're 10 times 10\ntimes engineer, but like uh okay, how do\nyou\n>> that's just the 10x engineer is like a\nis is a meme, isn't it? It's just means\nthat that that they're\n>> a red flag. Once I was interview I was\ninterviewed for a company and I I I\npassed and they offered me and I I\nwasn't really accepting the offer and\nthen they called me in and and then the\nthey called in like the CTO or CEO and\nhe came in I heard you're like a\n>> ax 10x engineer\n>> or or what do you call a hero or\nsomething like that and the moment I\nhear that word and then the other\nexamples was like you know our\noriginally founders they rewrote the\nwhole thing in in three nights of Red\nBull Uh, and I'm like, \"Yeah, no, no,\nI'm not joining your company.\"\n[laughter] If that's what you um, you\nknow, think is a good like work life\nbalance. Um, that's not the\n>> living in you are living in Asia. Work\nlife balance.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. That was\n>> Here we are talking about work on on a\nSaturday morning. Work life balance.\n>> I'm not talking about work. I'm ranting.\n[laughter]\n>> This is my my my exhaust. My\n>> this is my therapy. No, but like um\nyou're right with Jean then and um maybe\nthey are selling these they are selling\nAI and they're selling um this. So where\nare the actual measurements? I don't\nknow. Maybe they were referring\nsomething that's publicly available and\nI haven't read it. I just took them for\ntheir word. So\n>> Oh yeah. I mean also that that anthropic\nthing I think we discussed that earlier.\nI mean\n>> the report the that report that was made\nby a\n>> Oh yeah\n>> there was this entropic report and and\nit was like we asked cloud to estimate\nthe task and then it finished it in 10%\nof the time. We asked cloud to analyze\nall of its work and it and it estimated\nthat it finished it all in 10% of the\ntime. It's like yeah well [laughter]\n>> I guess the next thing I'm going to do\nis ask ask Gemini or Claude how to u\nmeasure the productivity gains. And of\ncourse it does feel completely wrong to\ndo it that way.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I I mean\n>> unless unless it can it can surface\nhard. I'm inclined to to just pull it\nback to vibes, you know, like so I was\nasked to give a pres internal\npresentation about the the gains of AI\nand um I'm thinking of just just uh\nturning turning the talk into something\nlike how people are happier.\nuh which might not go down well and I\nmight get\nbut I think I think that's the key thing\nfor me. I'm actually just genuinely\nhappier because I can now deliver faster\nand better work.\nYou know what a team lead of me in the\npast, he used to do the standup uh you\nknow every weekly sync up or I think it\nwas weekly and he would ask the mood\nlike happy sad every time for every\nevery member to measure it.\n>> Yeah. As part of the standup like you\nknow what did you you but it wasn't\nstandup maybe it was like the weekly uh\ncheck-in or something like that. But but\nteam white everyone\n>> Yeah. Yeah. But that's that's a typical\nthing you do in a retro for example, you\nknow. Yeah, you have safety check.\n>> If you have [clears throat] if you have\n>> if you have recorded it then you can say\nwell since we rolled out cloud code\nplans to everyone happiness has gone up.\n>> Yeah but\n>> anxiousness has gone up too. [laughter]\nWell, it's a difficult it's difficult to\nmeasure that too because ultimately\n>> I mean like personally\nI I I can be maybe it's the my Germanic\nblood but like I wake up in the morning\nand I'm not freaking happy dude\n>> and then people hey happy new year how's\nit going like like please\n>> like yeah sure\n>> cloud deployed all of my features that I\nI estimated for two weeks of work in\njust 3 days but at the same time the\ntoilet on the second level is broken.\nIt's like [laughter]\n>> Yeah. Oh, actually that that reminds me\nmy particular client the the office has\nso many like problems.\nBut I do think overall I think after the\nChristmas period, New Year period, the\nsentiment and the way people talk about\nAI has significantly changed.\nPeople are more like declaring that they\ndon't look at their code.\n>> Yeah. more\n>> that video. I mean, you linked it to me.\nI can't believe he was right.\n>> Yes. From\n>> that Theo video. I to be honest, I find\nTheo a little bit irritating to watch\nfor some reason. But like I did\n>> I always complain, but I always watch\nhis videos.\n>> Yeah, I did watch his video and I\nthought he I thought he was absolutely\nspot on. I even I even uh\n>> You're good.\n>> I even tweeted. Yeah. So,\nI don't know. Maybe it's his hair. But\nanyway, the\n>> it's just a side comments of like but I\nI felt maybe I got used to them or I\nfeel there's less. He was very much\nfrustrated that Antropic was not giving\nhim anything and he was very much saying\nOpenAI is doing a great job but maybe\nbecause it more aligns with me now.\nMaybe it's my little bubble and it fits\nin my bubble better. I was like, \"Oh,\nhe's he's hailing on Tropic now. I like\nto watch his videos.\" [laughter] But but\nI still feel like\num perhaps I need to rewatch the video,\nbut like um\nyeah, there was that that that\n[clears throat] whole spiel about not\nnot looking at the code anymore. But I\nstill feel like people\nI felt like he said it well maybe I'm\njust daydreaming at the moment but like\nI still there's still a lot of people\nwho somehow throw in a weird argument\nthat like I'm not looking at my code but\nat the same time I still I do look at I\ndo look at it just to make sure it's\nit's producing good code like so what is\nit? Are you looking or you're not\nlooking? You know, but I mean are are\nyou like what do you mean by I'm not\nlooking? You know, this is I feel like\npeople are not being super honest about\nit.\n>> I think it's a it's um it's a it's a\nslope. How do you say it's like a a\nrange of of looking at code? I'm looking\nat code.\n>> I'm not looking uh\n>> it's a range. Yes. I'm looking like at\nevery line or I'm looking at the\nfunctions or I'm looking at the file\nstructures or I'm looking at the you\nknow architecture high level um you know\ncleanliness of of of it perhaps um but\nI had something else I wanted to say and\nnow it's gone oh no that the other I\nthought you were going with that\nsentence like I'm not looking at the\ncode but it's and then they say it's the\nmost well- tested and validated code\nthat I have ever delivered in my life\nand and a lot of people say that like\nI've never spend so much like effort on\nunit tests because and I think this is\ntrue because with the AI the unit tests\nare so effective now the moment the AI\ndoesn't like write proper code in like\ncreates a small bug it gets an immediate\nfeedback immediately says like hey that\njust broke it's like oh I forgot about\nthat and it fixes it and I think that's\ntrue I think it and we and we discussed\nabout this for the last three podcasts\nand I hope I've convinced you a little\nbit but um but these\n>> I'm still a little bit dubious about\neven than that because in the last video\nif you remember we we we observed that\nthe beads uh\n>> no but failing we don't talk about beats\n>> we don't we don't talk about beats here\nI mean as as a we we talk about it as a\nmemory system not as a well tested\narchitecture because I told you in the\nvery early on I am very scared of\nupdating beats because I was just\nlooking at the change logs on the\nreleases and it was like fixing\nmerge conflict that corrupted all of\nyour issue task list I was like all the\nI don't want to upgrade to [laughter]\n[gasps] you know\n>> I think I think DAX and open code were\nwere extoring their tests but I haven't\nlooked at open code GitHub\nokay so I think so just let me talk\nabout\n>> just to summarize our last chat\n[snorts]\n>> if you want to talk about the test part\nbecause you just sent me the video of um\nspecdriven development from AI engineer\nthat was filmed. I looked at the date,\nNovember 22, uh, from one of the\nengineers that works on Kirro, the AWS\nspecdriven development IDE, and it was\nvery interesting because he dives into\nexactly where do they trust or put LLM\nflows and I know they because they do\nproperty based testing and if you use\nNodeJS, you can do that with fact check\nor fast check. Sorry, fast check.\n>> Yeah. Or hypothesis.\n>> Hypothesis in Python he mentions. Yes.\n>> So, I'm actually not very familiar with\nthis. This is so you do you know what\nare you talking about then?\n>> So because I was porting AWS CDK to\nCDKTF for Terraform um or CDK for\nTerraform there's several\num scenarios where they use property\nbased testing in their testing harness\nthat I also ported over. I think it was\nin um the way that you define schedules\num for like scheduled rules or scheduled\nthings like if you if you if you do\ncloudatch and you want to define a\nschedule and you have different\nconstraints they do property based\ntesting in that part of the code and I I\nnever used it before and I was like what\nis all this because then I have to I\nhave to install a fast check and I have\nto learn how that works and and usually\nI spend a lot of time trying to\nunderstand how the tool works. and how\nthe property based testing works. But in\nthis case, the moment I installed it and\nI copied over the to the the tests and\nthen I could verify that my uh Terraform\nbecause it wasn't really testing\nTerraform or cloud formation. It was\nreally testing the functionality of\ndefining a scheduled rule. So fast check\nreally cool. It was really nice to see\nit run and I'm very excited. Um\n>> okay. And so the fast check is a snap uh\nsorry\n>> is a NodeJS property based testing\nframework. Okay,\n>> I need to Okay, I want to see these\ntests run in open code and I'm just\nstruggling to\njust find out how they release.\nOkay, how like I hate it when there's no\nmake file.\nHow do you do that? So one of the things\nthat they highlighted uh in the in the\nspecdriven development setup of Kirao is\nthey use procedural or like algorithm um\ndeterministic logic um to set up the\ntesting and the validation. So they\nforce you early on to define ears\nformatted tests. So uh sorry um user\nrequirements and user stories\n>> like cucumber type stuff or what are you\ntalking Yeah, behavior driven kind of\nlike\nas a user when I do this I expect this\nor something like that. So that they are\nvery strict in the in the way that they\nwant want the LLM to generate these and\nthey do a lot of like structural tests\nagainst those because they evaluate that\nand they generate property based testing\nout of those markdown. So that's super\ninteresting, right? Because now you're\nno longer asking an LLM to transcribe\nthe user story into some type of\ntesting. you're actually fundamentally\nvalidating\num whatever the user and the LLM has\ncome to after you know brainstorming and\nI think LLMs are great at that um help\nus you know expand our horizon and think\nand um and then really structurally\nvalidate it and generate proper tests\nabout it u which you can trust so that\nwas a very nice uh aspect on it and then\nthe second part that he highlighted was\num in\n>> I got to see this I mean do can you show\nme these\nSorry, my brain is\nnot really working. So, do you have\nmaybe you can steal the screen share and\nand show me these property based tests?\nDo you have anything to add?\n>> I didn't I don't he didn't show them in\nthe video. Um I would need to install\nKira and figure out where\n>> Oh my god. So, we we're talking about\nit. We don't need we\n>> no because we are asking the question um\nhow can you trust the test that the LLM\nis writing and the way that K is solving\nit is by you know putting a lot of\nformal mechanisms around it and that's\nvery exciting\n>> this before I've never seen this before\n>> yeah yeah blacksmith runs on um\ndepot.deb I'm actually investigating\nthat because I'm forking the Terraform\nCDK and the biggest concern is the cost\nof the runners because some of those uh\nTypeScript um programs require eight\nCPUs and 32 GB of memory when they are\nrunning.\nSo I need to find a good uh GitHub\nhosted runner alternative.\n>> Okay. Do you use bun by the way? Cuz I\nnoticed Bun got bored.\n>> Everyone's using bun now. Yeah, Antropic\nacquired it. But like I'm struggling to\nrun this test here.\n>> This is bun turbo type check.\n>> Turbo is turbo repo.\n>> Type check is just a package of JSON. So\nturbo is a way to run uh tasks across\nyour monor repo and and with a cache. So\nit will look at the input sha and then\nif if the input sh didn't change it will\njust use the cached result so it can\nspeed up your task. So turbo is just\ngoing to run type check as a package of\nJSON script.\n>> Okay. Type check is just going to run\nTSC and usually type check is just\nrunning the TypeScript compiler. It's\nnot really\n>> I can't work out how to run uh open code\ntests.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. Okay. If I can't work out maybe\nlet's have a look at the the GitHub at\nleast. Um Oh, sorry. I'm not sharing the\nscreen here.\nI'm just I'm I'm\njust\n>> There are a lot of good things from the\nvideo you shared me.\n>> Oh, cool cool. But I need I'm a I'm a\nvisual learner. I need to see the bloody\ntest. I need I need to see the test. I\nneed to see it running.\nI need to see the test failing. I need\nto build\n>> trust with the the test has value. You\nknow what I mean? It's like [snorts]\n>> this is a journey. I maybe it's not\nworth talking about now. I I kind of\nwant to turn the conversation back to um\nOh yeah. Like one thing that was very\ngood that\n>> Yeah. from\n>> from Theo's video is the Jven's paradox\nwhich was actually mentioned by Simon\nWillis\n>> and I'm also a huge fan of Simon Willis.\n>> Uh if you don't subscribe to him then\nyou're missing out. I really love his uh\nhis tool to um share uh so so this post\nI wrote here is like I I use his UVX his\nclaude code transcripts into\n>> there's another tool I wanted to show\nyou as well but\n>> to pick out the session and then we sort\nof share it as a team. So I think this\nis like\n>> this is like level one.\n>> Yeah, this is very very level one. But\nbut but that's where we are at my\nworkplace. It's like it's like you know\nthe uh the different stakeholders and\nthe people are are basically in a\nbrowser copy and pasting between that\nand VS Code because the VS Code\norganization is so locked down. Uh\nanyway, so yeah paradox. Uh yeah, I'm\ntrying to get people I mean this is a\nnew argument for me and I I I'm I'm I'm\nI believe it. I'm I'm behind it. It's\nlike if things are getting easier to do,\nwe're going to do more of it, not less\nof it. I mean, I'm I'm I mean, I think\nit's all public stuff. I have a I have a\nguy that I I think I used to work with\nhim you um he was sort of posting some\nlike doomer stuff like it's like when\nAGA comes along then prime real estate\nis going to collapse and then I then I\nasked him like why do you think that and\nhe says like with with heavy uh AGI job\ndisplacement that uh people will become\non lower incomes and then people just\nwon't be able to to meet rent I think is\nwhat he was trying to say and then\nthere'll be like a a spiral down where\neverything sort of collapses\nand then I do mention Jven's paradox in\nthat in that Twitter thread\nand then he comes back by saying that's\nreason by analogy. Analogy will break at\nthe limit.\nIt will hold for some time.\num as long as we're not bottlenecked by\nenergy supply. Uh you know, oh god. Um\nbut but with the cost of intelligence\nlabor approaching zero,\n>> there'd be very few demands that supply\ncannot meet. Lower incomes coupled with\nlower prices would would would produce a\ndeflationary\ncycle like unlike any we've ever seen.\nUm and then then he quotes\nuh this some I don't know where he gets\nit exactly. We're going to hell before\neveryone goes to heaven. I mean I get\nthat but at the same time I don't want\nto get behind it. I I don't want to\nthink that's going to happen. I\nI mean his def his his com his\ncombativeness\nof like that Jven's paradox is going to\nsomehow break at the limit. I\nh I don't think I I don't think so.\nI mean I I don't want to think so\nbut um yeah regarding the the the the\nfact that originally I always feel that\nwe are heavily subsidized they are\nspending so much money and we are spend\nwe are actually using a lot more quote\nthan our quotas unless you're using API\nkeys which is dumb. Yeah, I mean I I\nthink things could get a bit more\nrestrictive in future. Like we're\ndefinitely since since we're the\nastronauts of of the AI, we we're\ngetting a free ride in some ways.\n>> Yeah. Which to me feels like it's going\nto become this elitists. Um only few\npeople can afford I think it's already a\nlittle bit the case, right? There's only\na few people that are spending $600 a\nmonth on three cloud max\nplans and those guys are like, you know,\noutputting. so much um that it's is if\nlike\n>> yeah like Steve Jger is like elevated.\n>> Yeah, he was he was he was very elevated\nbefore with this stuff.\n>> Yeah, I wanted to share something that I\nsaid I would I would share a couple of\ntools that are really cool. Um I want to\nshare my screen. Yeah.\n>> Well, actually I'm not too sure about\nthis.\n>> Can you see my screen?\n>> Yep.\nAll right. So, you see here at the top I\nhave this little little bar that shows\nlike my codecs. I've not used much right\nnow. And I'm\n>> Is that Is that a Is that an official\nCodeex thing or is it some\n>> No, it has Cloud here. Oh, so stupid. 5\nseconds ago, Cloud was right there. But\nI guess it I ran it on on uh another\none.\n>> I'm not I'm not a huge fan of menu bars.\nI always feel like they're just sucking\npower. But [snorts] you find this one\nuseful.\n>> Well, what did you\n>> for me from what I do right now? Because\nyou kept asking how do you keep track of\nthe context and how do you keep track of\nthe usage? But I I don't care so much\nabout context because you get a warning\nabout 30% in. So I'm like, okay, that's\nwhen I kill the session.\n>> I probably have to cut this out. You I\nthink you you accidentally shared\nsomeone's name there.\n>> Where?\n>> On the bottom left is a this\n>> Oh, this one.\n>> Yeah. No, he it's a book for about um AI\nchanges tools, but you still owe the\ncraft. I like that that uh page.\n>> Okay. I'm just a bit nervous about\nhaving to edit this video.\n>> It's not a CV or anything. It's a book.\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> Um so I think you'll be happy book.\n>> Oh, that's the author, I guess. Okay.\n>> Yeah, he's the author and he works at\nshopback in Singapore and he's kind of\nas an evangelist talking a lot about the\ntools because he's introducing them. I\nthink he's bit of an engineer.\n>> So, is he is he bumping up AI? Ah, well,\nthis is the kind of\n>> I don't know how how how we should\nreason about it. Yeah. But the fact is\nget back to\n>> maybe share that with me if it's if it's\ngood cuz I need the reason it's open on\nmy on my laptop is I still haven't read\nit.\n>> All right. Right. But but just just just\nto summarize where I am, Vincent, I need\nto\n>> to basically um become an AI mascot in\nmy company without\n>> Yeah, these are definitely the recovery\ncodes you should cut out.\n>> [laughter]\n>> Thanks.\nUh, okay. Hold it. Do I I need to really\ncut that out. Okay, let me just make a\nso I can find it. Cut.\n>> Your name escort. You can start from\nthere.\n>> Okay. What were you showing me? What\nwere you showing me? You showing me\n>> Hold on.\n>> Oh, you were showing me this like\ncodeex. uh you're showing me this menu\nbar thing\nyou're you're flexing to the the podcast\nlisteners or pe the viewers like yeah\nI've got I'm burnt I'm burnt through a\nbillion tokens in the last 24 hours\nstuff that you wouldn't couldn't afford\nor you couldn't get through your company\nno that's where we were we were talking\nabout how it's like an elitist right but\nthat made me realize I have this little\nbar here at the top that shows you how\nmuch codeex how cloud and then how much\nGemini I've used so far.\n>> How much of the Earth you've destroyed?\n>> Yeah, that's So people are doing these\nInstagram\n>> $500.\n>> No,\n>> that's API calls for sure because I only\npay $20 a month. So So just to show that\nif you pay API calls, it's a bit silly\nbecause they cost a lot of money. But if\nyou use something like um a $20\nsubscription, you get that in mind.\nBut still actually these these\n>> but this is this is this is wrong\nbecause this is probably because I\nhaven't spent extra usage 500\n>> as a consultant\npeople people it's it's sometimes eye\nwatering but it's not unusual to see\npeople being build you know thousand\n$1,000 US a day right for a consultant\nand and then and then I at the same time\nI get a bit you know I I shout out when\nI see someone that has spent $600 on\nClaude in a month. Of course,\nin real terms, AI is incredibly more\nefficient than a than a consultant.\n[snorts] Okay, maybe I have to cut that\nout.\nYeah, I'm trying to find So, this is um\ncloud cuz you were showing a way to\nshare cloud sessions. You can take a\nsession and you can create a nice web\npage from it. Yeah. Using Simon Willis's\ntool.\n>> Yeah, I can link to the my blog.\n>> And then there's this thing called the\nthe cloud um I don't know what it stands\nfor like assistant session reviewer and\nit's Cass\nand it you run an indexer across your\ncloud session directory and it will it's\nusing oh it's using Rust so it must be\nfast, right? Okay.\n>> Oh, come on. This is trivial stuff, but\nyou could do this in shell.\n>> No, but the fact is that that like\n>> Okay. So, so you're basically going\nacross all your conversations.\n>> Yeah. Across everything and you can type\nlike a small little like a single word\nand it will find all of them. I think\nit's doing a fuzzy search. I'm not sure.\nBut my indexer has an error apparent on\nits another problem is\n>> so so when it comes to these transcripts\nI feel like um there needs to be a tool\nto say like\num to to rate to rate the transcripts\nright like like this was a really good\nsession this this session sucked what\nwent wrong here what went right here you\nknow these these sort of like metadata\nso we have a way of sharing transcripts\nbut we don't have a great way\n>> oh look at even works across open code\nand codex in Gemini.\n>> Yeah. Nice. So we don't have we don't\nhave a nice way of of really\nlearning as a human how to interact with\nAI. I feel because if we if we feed\nthese transcripts back into AI and\nasking how to improve I think that I'm\nnot too sure it might work but\n>> yeah but that's not\n>> but I'm I'm talking about upskilling\nteams getting getting people more to\nbuild trust with the and building shared\nprompts and things like that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I'm this\nis what I'm trying to do at work.\n>> So, this is one thing that they\nhighlight in um somebody asked a\nquestion in the KO talk saying, \"Can I\ncustomize the templates and the prompts\nand the workflow and they're like they\nare over here?\" I don't remember the\nanswer, but it it seemed like given the\nway that they are so structured, I think\nit's hard for you to change those\nthings. And um I definitely feel that\nthose templates, those workflows, like I\ntry to use speckit to set up some type\nof uh ADR. So it's funny because speckit\nis ADR in a way kind not really exactly\nthe same, but it's in a way you're\ncapturing like a decision\nrecord, right? Um, so I was trying to\nask specit to create a decision record\nand it couldn't really get it because\nlike, oh, you're building a program. So,\nand I was like, yeah, no, but we're\nusing LLMs. I was like, oh, so you're\nbuilding a program that um is going to,\nyou know, you know, you're going to call\nout to the open API and and I was like,\nno, no, no. I'm trying to do something.\n[laughter] So, it was really uh really\ndifficult to get it to do kind of like\nmeta meta spec type of things like I\nwant you to create a library of prompts\nto use for my community planning\nsessions and things like that. It was\nlike huh I only know how to create a\nprogram just like so you want me to\ncreate a program to run your community\nmeetings? No, no, that's not what I\nwant. So, it was um so yes, you need to\nbe able to modify these workflows. Uh I\ntried conductor first by the way to have\na feel of it.\n>> Oh, yeah. Oh,\n>> did you have a good experience like I\ndid?\n>> No, actually both conductor even though\nin the in the product design and\ndefinition I said very clearly like what\nwe're building here is a way to like a a\ntype of a process for the repository. I\nwant to build a pro. So it's a repo for\nkeeping track of decisions and proposals\nand spec and so on and and um no didn't\ngo for that. Again, probably not the\nright project for it. But yeah, other\nthan that, conductor was pretty cool. I\nI feel it actually kept kept Gemini\ngoing like uh I thought at some point\nwhen I finished with all of the upfront\nplanning, Gemini went in a loop and for\na significant amount of time kept going.\nI've never seen Gemini keep going like\nthat uh in a while. Have you had the\nsame experience with conductor like\nthat? It can keep keep Gemini going a\nbit like\n>> Well, it was a good experience. So I\nguess I I don't I mean it was a week ago\nif not more. So I guess I guess it was\ndoing its thing. Yeah, I guess it was\ndoing it thing. [snorts] Oh, okay. You\nknow what? I need the weather is\nactually good right now. It's not\nraining. I feel like I need to wash my\ncar and run around while there's some\nsunlight. So I think I'm going to end\nthe conversation a bit early if you\ndon't mind. I still think I still think\nwhat we talked about was valuable. I\ndon't know if if we I guess at this\npoint I would like to engage anyone\nwho's listening to please comment below\nand uh chime in with your thoughts\naround making AI uh I mean are you\npositive about AI and things like that\nor another interesting thing that Theo\ndid he had like a little poll on his\nvideo to say that do you think Opus or\ndo you think Claude is outputting better\ncode than you are at this point and I\nthink it was like 65%\nagree agreed that Claude is already\nbetter than them at coding, which I\nthought was interesting. And to be\nhonest, I agree. Like I don't know how\nyou feel. Me too.\n>> Yeah, me too. I think it's better\nbecause it's better than me.\n>> Uh it's more like it has a broader\nknowledge base like it can produce code\nfor a broader set of things that I don't\nknow.\n>> Yeah. But even if I ask it to produce Go\ncode or or code or languages I know\nquite well, I I don't I think it's\npretty okay.\n>> No, but I liked Steve's take saying that\nit's way better at Go than at\nTypescript. I always felt TypeScript is\nperfect because it gives you the\nstructure and the schemas, but Steve\nsays types is TypeScript is way too you\ncan do way too fancy things with types\nand TypeScript and Go is just really\ndown to the you know straightforward. So\nso AI is better with Go. There there's\nsome arguments made I think oh I can't I\ncan't remember his name now uh the\neducator guy he was who makes some\ntypescript courses he was arguing that\ntypes and AI go well together because\nyou want those that that that test\n>> I always feel like that but Steve Jger\nwas saying that that he he he rewrote\ngas\n>> typescript was was sucks in that regard\n>> he says it's it's a token waste it's\nit's generating a ton of tokens that\ndon't really do much and uh and with\n>> code is so much cleaner\nand direct although that I like what I\nlike with go is this very um you know\nwrite everything twice mentality of go\nwhich is like don't over generalize no\ngenerics for ages don't like just\nrewrite the code rewrite the functions\n>> I still I still don't even quite\nunderstand generics I mean I don't use\nthem so maybe I'm missing out\n>> I I did originally when I was writing\ncode golang but when I asked the llam to\nwrite I I go like yeah don't like I\ndon't mind it being duplicated in\nseveral places cuz I'm like\n>> Yeah, exactly. It's cheap. Yeah. To do\nall the different uh\n>> you need to maintain it. It's going to\nfigure out\n>> switches and all that sort of stuff.\nYeah. Yeah. I get it. I mean, go it. I\nmean, I'm feeling pretty pretty uh #\nuh what do you call it? Inspired #\ngrateful. because I know Go better than\nmost people and uh and I know AI better\nthan most people in some ways and\neverything everything's coming together\nreally nicely for me. I feel and I'm\ntouching wood here. is like everything's\ngoing well except maybe my pay packet.\nBut uh\nyou also did one final uh because the\nwhole tailwind laying off 75% of staff\nand then people saying well well if your\nbusiness model was like what was their\nbusiness model right how that they got\ndisrupted. I don't know if you know\nabout this whole Tailwind scenario.\n>> Oh yeah I didn't I did notice that was\nthat was interesting. Uh I think I\ndidn't read the whole post and he also\nmade a podcast himself, right? Where\nhe's walking his\n>> I read the post and I listened to the\nwhole podcast.\n>> Oh, really? So you probably have more\ndetails, but but my my uh what do you\ncall it? Headline reading interpretation\nwas that was that um yeah the LLM was\nwas was taking their business away\nbecause uh you didn't need to use\nTailwind and its abstractions I suppose\nto do to work with CSS. You can just get\nClaude to do it.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then it boiled down also to the\nwebsite. So I think there's this llm.ext\nand they removed it because they don't\nwant to\n>> the thing that triggered it is somebody\nwent I'm going to here's a pull request\nto add the llm.txt to your docs.\n>> And he was I'm sorry but I have to\ndecline this. I just had to lay out 75%\nbecause the docs are our only funnel and\nnobody's reading them because the LLMs\nare just generating code. Nobody's\nreading our docs anymore. And it's how\nwe we funnel our business. We've got 80%\ndown uh in revenue. Um for you know was\nit 80% down in traffic through through\nuh those funnels. So he's measuring\nthose different you know ways that they\nare driving business right and and a lot\nof discussions\n>> stack overflow problem in a way but\nwhatever it's different. Yeah. Uh so a\nlot of people were saying like from\nTailwind they realized as a as a an\nexpert um I have a network and people\ncome to me to and and that's how I get\njobs but that all falls away with AI. Uh\nand and then some some of the uh um he\nsays I've been sponsoring Tailwind for a\nlong time. Love what they do. I learned\na lot from them. So in his video was\nmore like highlighting all the good work\nthat they've done and he shared like\nthere's this even if you are using an\nLLM reading their design um you know\nguides like they have they written a\nbook on how to do the UX which is not\njust about the CSS but really about like\nhow to build uh UX. He says that's a\nreally good book then you should really\nread it and he's also encouraging people\nto sponsor them.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. But that I mean I'm sponsoring is\nalways not a solution right? You need a\nviable business business model. If their\nbusiness model is upselling through\ntheir docs, yeah, they're in problem. I\nmean, and interestingly, Charlie from\nthe Astro Project mentioned that that\nthey have LLM's text, but they also have\na similar they're they're in the similar\nboat\n>> because they need to upsell their other\num\n>> they're hosting, I guess. Oh, they have\nsome um\nwhat is there? I can't even remember\nwhat they're business. [snorts]\n>> There's a there's a there's a product\nthat I think they were working on. Oh,\nthis Pyx thing.\n>> I think that's\n>> going to be uh a paid for thing.\n>> That's like Dino then. Dino and Bun like\nreinventing the packaging. Well, not\nBun, but Dino reinventing the packaging.\nSo, so you get the point that everything\ncould just Yeah, they're in the similar\nboat. Okay. Anyway, I'm I'm interrupting\nI'm interrupting you.\n>> No, the other thing that Tio said is as\na as a business, if you let LLM generate\nyour code, go check the dependencies and\nsee if you can go sponsor them like if\nbut but to me it seems like the real\nsolution is is ads, right? This is how\nWarp they say like we're giving you Opus\n4 access for a fraction of the cost\nbecause they put\n>> no one's going to read the docs ads. How\nyou\n>> Yeah. Because ultimately inside the docs\nare ads. Like if you like to if you like\nthis here's our our offering, right? So\nif you translate it, nobody's going to\nthe dogs. It means that those ads no\nlonger live with the dogs, but they must\nbe surfaced by the LM somehow, right?\nAnd Warp's uh operating model is like we\ngive cheap AI access in our terminal by\nserving you ads and that's like\nand and you know if OpenAI would\nintroduce that you know the alterate is\nalready created but it's the only way\nlike if OpenAI can semantically\n>> any business that requires ads now I\nguess with with LLMs in the mix LLMs are\nfiltering out the ads\n>> so any business model that relies on ads\nis basically in trouble here and it\nprobably includes includes Google.\n>> Google of course. Yeah, Google. Google\nhad a big re wakeup call. They had all\nhands on deck\n>> uh early in the in the Chad GPT saga.\n>> So what is what is Google's response\nthere\n>> to become a leader because they have put\nso much money. They have their own TPUs.\nThey build their own Gemini CLI. They\nthey become an LLM platform.\n>> But like okay, go going back to\nTailwind. I mean don't say sponsorship\nis the answer because it's not. What is\nVincent? How do you think they're gonna\ncome out of this or how how is Astral\ngoing to come out of this?\n>> I think if the LLMs I guess it's it's\nthe whole problem with LLM's not giving\nattribution, right? If there's a way for\nLLMs to give better attribution and it's\nlike I'm you know imagine that while\nit's generating your website it goes and\nby the way there's a sale on Tailwind\nright now. [laughter]\nI'm I'm using Tailwind to build your\nwebsite. No. Um,\n>> that sounds like another weird form of\nadvertising which sounds insane.\n>> It would be funny if if if you're try if\nyou're using the MCP or you're\ntroubleshooting the issue and you're\ngoing like, you know, it's still not\nlooking right. There's still an\noverlaying bug. It just stops. I just\nsaid, go to the Tailwind team, dude.\nLike, [laughter] go ask them to fix to\nhelp you fix it.\n>> Pay them. Um, cuz I don't have the\nanswer here. [laughter]\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh god. I think if a company is smart\nand and onropic is smart because they\ndid like the double limits usage limits\nfor for the whole Christmas holiday that\nwas a gigantic success. Look at how many\npeople tried it out. They were like I\ngot so much done and I'm 100% in on this\nright now. I actually upgraded to $100.\n>> They just they're like drug dealers,\naren't they?\n>> Yeah. So if there's if if Antropic is\nlistening, Boris, [laughter]\n>> if they're smart, what they're going to\ndo is they're going to make\n>> more correct.\n>> Yeah. like loop detected. Um, please\nlike based on the context it looks like\nlike Clippy pops up. Looks like you're\ntrying to fix a wind a tailwind issue.\n[laughter]\nHere's the tailwind guys website.\n>> No, I think your proposal I mean it's\nfrankly\n>> ads are coming. Ads are coming. I think\nthis is\n>> there's got to be a better Okay,\n>> I'm going to do a hot take. Hot take\n2026 hot take from Vincent. Ads in your\nLLMs this year. Guaranteed warp's\nalready there. So I already what? Not\nexcept for warp. Let's talk.\n>> Arguably there already ads like when you\nrun claude it gives you like a tip. Try\nthis mobile experience. Try this.\n>> But it's always there. It's always like\nuse our our designer plugin for better\nweb design. What about it goes like use\nthe Tailwind MCP subscription only $5 a\nmonth. [laughter]\nOkay. Bye. Go wash your car.\nLet's see how many people hate comments.\n[snorts]\n>> Okay, please please please rate the\npodcast. Please comment below. Please\ntell me how we tell us how we can\nimprove. Actually, I did get feedback\nfrom from from Swix, but the the\nRiverside thing looks a bit too\nexpensive for me at least. It's like £24\na month\n>> to to improve the quality. I was like, I\ndon't want to spend money.\n>> Everything's improving except my pay\npacket.\nUh, I did earn I Oh, yeah. I should I\nshould note maybe I can give you access\nto my YouTube studio, but I think I I've\nearned two pound\nthanks to this whole podcast series. So,\nthanks Vincent for coming on the show.\n>> That's two pound off for a family of\nfour.\n>> Two pound. I I'll I think I'll can buy\nyou a coffee when I see you in Vietnam\nor something.\n>> Yeah. Come to Vietnam. You can feast\n>> for exactly one meal.\n>> Wow. [laughter]\nYeah, I that's probably the real issue\nthat we should have talked about is how\npeople's pay because Madu Shan who I was\nchatting to on X, he was right to point\nout that that people's income is not\nimproving.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah. [clears throat]\n>> Okay. See you guys.\n>> See you.\n>> See you guys. Oh my god. I say you guys.\nSorry. So, see you Vincent.\n>> Comment below. Bye.\n>> You guys and girls. Come on.\n>> Oh yeah. Sorry.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–4:40]\nYo, how was your trip yesterday? >> It was pretty epic. There was a huge storm in the UK actually and I'm and I pretty much drove well, not through it, but like I stopped off at my sisters and then I and then when it passed, I drove after it. So, I got to see the beginning of it and the and the after of it. So, it was a pretty epic storm. >> Have you seen that kite surfing video? [clears throat] There was like >> in Israel >> during a storm >> there was like a thermal vortex like a little cyclone and some kite surfers got caught into it and one guy he went like super high but he was able to eject when he was lowered to the ground. The other guy he got dragged onto rocks and died. So it was um it's been posted like four or five times on Reddit. Maybe because I like to kite surfer so I see it. >> It's pretty bad. But yeah, you're talking about the storm reminded me. Sorry you were saying after the storm. Uh but I mean to be honest we were not impacted. But one thing that makes me nervous is that um I think last year was it the year before we had a storm durag and we were out of power for like two 47 hours. Is that two days almost? And it was pretty terrible because without power we cannot actually power our oil or gas heating systems. >> Basically [snorts] It really goes to hell here very quickly. And uh and funny and the other thing that really irritates me is that like as a South African if I'm actually used to the power to go to go out but the infrastructure the mobile infrastructure it always has like a huge backup. Your audio just switched >> from what to what? >> I don't know the audio. Maybe when you when you moved closer. Maybe it's it's >> Oh, you know what? I think I I knocked out the bloody uh RX or something. >> Yeah. Test. >> No, when you said that about um you couldn't turn on your electric like cooking or or anything. When I wanted I came to Vietnam, I I really hated those gas cookers. >> Oh, yeah. But now you love them. >> And and the fire. I don't like it because I see videos of these gas canisters exploding and things like that. And I was begging my um my wife to get like um an electric cooker and she's like, \"No way.\" You know, there's going to be a power outage and we can't cook. >> Yeah. >> Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. [snorts] So we have we have like a little Korean set and those little butane canisters for for for these occasions. >> But yeah, going back to the the infrastructure cuz this is the AI infrastructure podcast. >> Yeah. >> In…\n\n[slide:2] [4:19–13:37]\nsince I'm a middle manager I don't know how you feel you are in in the industry but I mean I do feel like I'm a very hands-on middle manager but nonetheless I'm a middle manager since I'm my middle manager. I have I have the the executive sort of asking me, \"Hey, Kai, um how's this AI thing going? Um it makes people more productive, right? It it's how much more productive 100 100% 200% how can you just tell can you build a case study for me to show how how more productive you are with AI?\" And this is in that said and the AI roller in this particular customer is incredibly frustrating and bad because they disable uh all the good models. So that I got on one hand I've got the these sort of questions and then and then for the sort of the colleagues sort of um that I work with many of them are actually um quite nervous about the future and um okay I'm exaggerating here when they when they when I think in my in the in the notes I call them doomers but like a lot of people say like are basically like uh saying to me that like oh um AI isn't going to make me um you know twice as effective. And it's absolute [ __ ] that management are are coming up with these things as an excuse to uh reorg and lay off people. But that's the way they feel and and and and I'm in the middle and I don't know and my feeling is is is just trying to be well I am a positive I like to think I'm a positive person. Some some people might disagree with with with that sentiment, but like I'm very excited about the future. I am so excited, but at the same time, like I can't really like my my fun factor that we have in our little podcast chats, I does that translate to a 200% productivity? I I I I am reluctant to say that. and and at the same time I'm like how do I make how do I make people more positive who are around me or or you know >> report to me you know what I mean >> okay let's because you touched on like five different points I think the first one you mentioned is how do you me measure productivity and that's all about the devops accelerate report right dora metrics how many times do you deploy how long product feature to go to production >> let's be real a lot of these dora metrics aren't aren't extremely well recorded and and things like that and they're very hard to >> No, no, there are so we implemented the Dora metrics well me uh a a colleague of mine implemented the Dora metrics as a previous company and you you have four clear metrics that are well defined of what you need…\n\n[slide:3] [13:17–22:41]\nbiggest [ __ ] in the room. >> Yeah, I do say some things. But I've learned to say those things not in public channels anymore. [laughter] >> But I go [snorts] to people, I say like that's not right. You just added the tags manually. >> Private meetings will resume. [laughter] So, but then the second part you touched on is about the human aspect like because yes sure you can measure a team per team and you can measure those metrics but this is something that Jean Kim and Steve Jagger touched on in their talk right when they said like they had a problem in OpenAI um in where how can you compare somebody that has fully adopted LLM versus someone who hasn't because if they looked at at the traditional metrics someone who has adopted AI is doing a lot better and and so >> well they say that and they don't really tell you >> because they sell it also, right? >> Yeah. And this is the this is the frustrating thing is like, oh yeah, they're much better. They're 10 times 10 times engineer, but like uh okay, how do you >> that's just the 10x engineer is like a is is a meme, isn't it? It's just means that that that they're >> a red flag. Once I was interview I was interviewed for a company and I I I passed and they offered me and I I wasn't really accepting the offer and then they called me in and and then the they called in like the CTO or CEO and he came in I heard you're like a >> ax 10x engineer >> or or what do you call a hero or something like that and the moment I hear that word and then the other examples was like you know our originally founders they rewrote the whole thing in in three nights of Red Bull Uh, and I'm like, \"Yeah, no, no, I'm not joining your company.\" [laughter] If that's what you um, you know, think is a good like work life balance. Um, that's not the >> living in you are living in Asia. Work life balance. >> Yeah. Yeah. That was >> Here we are talking about work on on a Saturday morning. Work life balance. >> I'm not talking about work. I'm ranting. [laughter] >> This is my my my exhaust. My >> this is my therapy. No, but like um you're right with Jean then and um maybe they are selling these they are selling AI and they're selling um this. So where are the actual measurements? I don't know. Maybe they were referring something that's publicly available and I haven't read it. I just took them for their word. So >> Oh yeah. I mean also that that anthropic thing I think we discussed that earlier. I mean >> the report the that report that was…\n\n[slide:4] [22:20–31:39]\nbecause you just sent me the video of um specdriven development from AI engineer that was filmed. I looked at the date, November 22, uh, from one of the engineers that works on Kirro, the AWS specdriven development IDE, and it was very interesting because he dives into exactly where do they trust or put LLM flows and I know they because they do property based testing and if you use NodeJS, you can do that with fact check or fast check. Sorry, fast check. >> Yeah. Or hypothesis. >> Hypothesis in Python he mentions. Yes. >> So, I'm actually not very familiar with this. This is so you do you know what are you talking about then? >> So because I was porting AWS CDK to CDKTF for Terraform um or CDK for Terraform there's several um scenarios where they use property based testing in their testing harness that I also ported over. I think it was in um the way that you define schedules um for like scheduled rules or scheduled things like if you if you if you do cloudatch and you want to define a schedule and you have different constraints they do property based testing in that part of the code and I I never used it before and I was like what is all this because then I have to I have to install a fast check and I have to learn how that works and and usually I spend a lot of time trying to understand how the tool works. and how the property based testing works. But in this case, the moment I installed it and I copied over the to the the tests and then I could verify that my uh Terraform because it wasn't really testing Terraform or cloud formation. It was really testing the functionality of defining a scheduled rule. So fast check really cool. It was really nice to see it run and I'm very excited. Um >> okay. And so the fast check is a snap uh sorry >> is a NodeJS property based testing framework. Okay, >> I need to Okay, I want to see these tests run in open code and I'm just struggling to just find out how they release. Okay, how like I hate it when there's no make file. How do you do that? So one of the things that they highlighted uh in the in the specdriven development setup of Kirao is they use procedural or like algorithm um deterministic logic um to set up the testing and the validation. So they force you early on to define ears formatted tests. So uh sorry um user requirements and user stories >> like cucumber type stuff or what are you talking Yeah, behavior driven kind of like as a user when I do this I expect this or something like that. So that they are…\n\n[slide:5] [31:19–40:32]\nto get behind it. I I don't want to think that's going to happen. I I mean his def his his com his combativeness of like that Jven's paradox is going to somehow break at the limit. I h I don't think I I don't think so. I mean I I don't want to think so but um yeah regarding the the the the fact that originally I always feel that we are heavily subsidized they are spending so much money and we are spend we are actually using a lot more quote than our quotas unless you're using API keys which is dumb. Yeah, I mean I I think things could get a bit more restrictive in future. Like we're definitely since since we're the astronauts of of the AI, we we're getting a free ride in some ways. >> Yeah. Which to me feels like it's going to become this elitists. Um only few people can afford I think it's already a little bit the case, right? There's only a few people that are spending $600 a month on three cloud max plans and those guys are like, you know, outputting. so much um that it's is if like >> yeah like Steve Jger is like elevated. >> Yeah, he was he was he was very elevated before with this stuff. >> Yeah, I wanted to share something that I said I would I would share a couple of tools that are really cool. Um I want to share my screen. Yeah. >> Well, actually I'm not too sure about this. >> Can you see my screen? >> Yep. All right. So, you see here at the top I have this little little bar that shows like my codecs. I've not used much right now. And I'm >> Is that Is that a Is that an official Codeex thing or is it some >> No, it has Cloud here. Oh, so stupid. 5 seconds ago, Cloud was right there. But I guess it I ran it on on uh another one. >> I'm not I'm not a huge fan of menu bars. I always feel like they're just sucking power. But [snorts] you find this one useful. >> Well, what did you >> for me from what I do right now? Because you kept asking how do you keep track of the context and how do you keep track of the usage? But I I don't care so much about context because you get a warning about 30% in. So I'm like, okay, that's when I kill the session. >> I probably have to cut this out. You I think you you accidentally shared someone's name there. >> Where? >> On the bottom left is a this >> Oh, this one. >> Yeah. No, he it's a book for about um AI changes tools, but you still owe the craft. I like that that uh page. >> Okay. I'm just a bit nervous about having to edit this video. >> It's not a CV or anything. It's a book. >> Oh, okay. >> Um so I think…\n\n[slide:6] [40:12–45:31]\ndifficult to get it to do kind of like meta meta spec type of things like I want you to create a library of prompts to use for my community planning sessions and things like that. It was like huh I only know how to create a program just like so you want me to create a program to run your community meetings? No, no, that's not what I want. So, it was um so yes, you need to be able to modify these workflows. Uh I tried conductor first by the way to have a feel of it. >> Oh, yeah. Oh, >> did you have a good experience like I did? >> No, actually both conductor even though in the in the product design and definition I said very clearly like what we're building here is a way to like a a type of a process for the repository. I want to build a pro. So it's a repo for keeping track of decisions and proposals and spec and so on and and um no didn't go for that. Again, probably not the right project for it. But yeah, other than that, conductor was pretty cool. I I feel it actually kept kept Gemini going like uh I thought at some point when I finished with all of the upfront planning, Gemini went in a loop and for a significant amount of time kept going. I've never seen Gemini keep going like that uh in a while. Have you had the same experience with conductor like that? It can keep keep Gemini going a bit like >> Well, it was a good experience. So I guess I I don't I mean it was a week ago if not more. So I guess I guess it was doing its thing. Yeah, I guess it was doing it thing. [snorts] Oh, okay. You know what? I need the weather is actually good right now. It's not raining. I feel like I need to wash my car and run around while there's some sunlight. So I think I'm going to end the conversation a bit early if you don't mind. I still think I still think what we talked about was valuable. I don't know if if we I guess at this point I would like to engage anyone who's listening to please comment below and uh chime in with your thoughts around making AI uh I mean are you positive about AI and things like that or another interesting thing that Theo did he had like a little poll on his video to say that do you think Opus or do you think Claude is outputting better code than you are at this point and I think it was like 65% agree agreed that Claude is already better than them at coding, which I thought was interesting. And to be honest, I agree. Like I don't know…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This episode is a wide-ranging conversation that starts with a storm anecdote and quickly centers on practical questions about measuring AI-driven productivity, the human friction that accompanies adoption, how teams build trust in LLM-generated code via testing and spec-driven workflows, and the emerging business pressures (access costs, funnel collapse, and the idea of ads inside LLMs). The hosts mix concrete examples from company practice (DORA snapshots, property-based testing, runner costs) with tech-culture takes (Jevons paradox, “10x” skepticism) and tool notes (transcript indexers, conductor, spec tools).  \n[slide:1]\n## Opening: storm, power and infrastructure\nConversation opens with personal storm anecdotes and a concrete resilience problem: an earlier outage left the speaker “out of power for like two 47 hours” (almost two days), exposing how quickly heating and mobile connectivity fail without electricity and prompting practical coping choices (butane cookers, spare kits) and a brief digression about unreliable mobile mast backup in rural areas.\n[slide:2]\n## Execs demand numbers: “How much more productive?”\nA middle manager describes being asked to quantify AI productivity gains (“how much more productive 100 100% 200%”), while customers sometimes block the best models; the practical answer discussed is to use DORA-style engineering metrics (four defined metrics from the Accelerate research), take early snapshots per team (data, cloud, app, iPad teams) and compare pre/post AI adoption using instrumented sources (GitHub, Jira, PR/release timestamps) to show measurable change.\n[slide:3]\n## Metrics culture, fudging, and adoption anxiety\nSpeakers warn about presentation culture and gaming numbers (example: tagging coverage reported jumping from 20% to 60% after manual/retroactive edits), and about comparing adopters to non-adopters (OpenAI/other reports claim big gains but lack transparent methodology); they push back on hype labels like “10x engineer” and cite suspicious self-reports (a tool claiming it “finished it in 10% of the time”) as reasons to insist on verifiable, repeatable measurement and private challenge of fudged results.\n[slide:4]\n## Spec-driven dev and trustworthy tests for LLM output\nThe hosts highlight a spec-driven IDE approach (Kirro) that mixes deterministic logic and formatted user stories to generate structural tests, and they recommend property-based testing (fast-check in Node, Hypothesis in Python) to validate behavior rather than surface syntax. Practical notes: porting CDK to CDKTF revealed test harness value, but also costly CI requirements (examples noted: TypeScript jobs needing ~8 CPUs and 32 GB RAM), so runner costs and caching (turbo cache, monorepo task runners) matter for real-world adoption.\n[slide:5]\n## Jevons paradox, access inequality, and session tooling\nThey invoke Jevons paradox — *\"if things are getting easier to do, we're going to do more of it, not less of it.\"* — to argue easier AI will expand activity, not shrink it, while flagging access stratification: a handful of heavy users spend hundreds of dollars monthly (example figure cited: people spending ~$600/month) and capture outsized output. To counter siloed learning, they demo transcript/session tooling (a Rust-based indexer and sharing tool) and argue teams need transcript rating, shared prompts, and workflows to upskill people and capture institutional knowledge.\n[slide:6]\n## Workflows, conductor, and the revenue threat to docs\nThey discuss limits of structured LLM workflows (difficulty getting templates to do meta tasks like “library of prompts”), mixed experiences with conductor (sometimes keeps an LLM loop going), and real business risk: a docs-driven project reported an ~80% drop in funnel traffic/revenue after LLMs started generating code for users, triggering major staff reductions in one example; as a commercial response the hosts debate attribution and monetization inside LLM flows and offer a blunt hot take — ads or paid surfaced attributions inside model outputs are likely to appear — and note a viewer poll result that around 65% thought an LLM already outcodes them, summarized as *\"Claude is already better than them at coding\"*."
