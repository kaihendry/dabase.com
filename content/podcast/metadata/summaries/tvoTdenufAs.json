I\njust I just been enjoying walking around\nactually. It's been fun. And the\narchitecture is pretty amazing. Like I'm\nconfused cuz I I always thought to\nmyself that like\nI don't know that that um\nthat Europe is\ndying.\n>> Well, yeah. Exactly. But like the\nbuildings there are quite wellmaintained\nand rich. You know what I mean? It's\nlike confused.\n>> If you believe certain politicians, it's\nall you know run over by crime. And\n>> maybe maybe that's still the case.\n>> Yeah. And there's a lot of like um you\nknow young beautiful people walking\naround and uh\nYeah. It's quite it's quite different to\nLondon. I'd say\n>> cuz I'm old now. See why hair cannot be\nthere anymore.\n>> I'm I'm freaking Gandalf right now, man.\n>> Yeah. So yeah, Belgian's been great and\nyeah, the conflict management camp was\ngood. I mean, I think it's actually the\nbest infrastructure conference on the\nplanet, I dare say.\n>> Is it now?\n>> And you missed out on\n>> Yeah, I did uh fortunately um after some\ninformation around holiday period, I had\nto\n>> lock in some uh contracts and deals and\nit's been going great. So,\nunfortunately, I couldn't make it to\nconfig management camp, but I was able\nto do different things.\n>> So, this is all CDK ter was it CD? what\ndo you call your your\n>> DDK terrain it's called now hey actually\nyour your your proposal of the Golang um\nsetup of a project and hosting on AWS\nwhere on one side you evaluate cloud\nform versus the AWS CLI and AWS CDK uh\nbut you're not evaluating Terraform in\nthere um you're comparing it against\ncloud for\n>> well that that plan that I sent you like\nI\n>> I I thought I wouldn't influence it that\nmuch but I asked Claude\n>> to give me what it wants to do.\n>> And funny enough, it didn't mention\nTerraform. Like I was I started the\nprompt saying like\n>> that's interesting.\n>> Like what how would you\num and I I think I I should have shared\nthe prompt, shouldn't I? I think I was\nopt I was optimizing for speed and\noperational simplicity\nand that's what and and CDK came up top.\nSo yeah.\n>> Yeah. But like\n>> even if you look at the data of that\nlike um report that was shared by Matt\nGawi um but it's it's AWS usage data\nreport about how people deploy on top of\nAWS. Cloud formation was by far the the\nhighest used and then there was\nTerraform right after and then there was\nAWS CDK. You know, I I I find it funny\nthat you don't combine AWS CDK and cloud\nfor because it's the same, right? It's\ncloud form. Uh except you have a better\ninterface when you use AWS CDK.\n>> Well, I mean, not you like the the\npeople that that support.\n>> Yeah. The I guess the winner for CDK is\nthe is the you know the shift left early\nfeedback because at at compile time\nyou should kind of know if if your code\nis working, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I mean and I think that\n>> not 100% but like good enough.\n>> You you I you you must have influenced\ncloud to consider this as one of the\ncriteria fact of the compile time\nchecking or it's influenced by your\nprevious discussions.\n>> Maybe maybe maybe\n>> so I had a chat with the Palumi guys\nat the desk at config management camp\nyesterday. I was pretty impressed with\nwhat they\n>> they're doing really cool stuff. Yeah.\nNo, no. I have to say like if you\nconsider CDKTF and Pulumi as as like\ncompetitors, I don't think that's true\nbecause I I mean I was naive. I I did\noriginally consider them. Uh but then\nsomebody showed you know wisen me up and\nand showed me some of the really cool\nstuff because Pulumi is a host engine\nthat allows your um your infrastructure\ncode to hook into some really advanced\nfeatures that you can't do with\nTerraform declarative configuration or\nyou can't do even with CDKTF unless you\nhave some type of like the the runtime\nthe host environment in which your your\nTypeScript or Python or Golang you know\nthe host is is giving the\ninfrastructures code a lot of like\ndynamic capabilities of lookup and AWS\nCDK does some of that because you you do\nhave the CLI able to host\n>> what do you mean the host like the their\nSAS application what do you mean by host\n>> no no no like the puli host so when you\nrun the when you run your infrastructure\nconfiguration application it's an\napplication right when you run it in\npuli it runs inside a host that runs\nyour\n>> like the kubernetes model like desired\nstate is it why is it like that?\n>> Uh no it's like you know because\nultimately puli uses the terapform\nproviders so under the hood at least\noriginally. So, so what what it does\ngive the program, you know, because your\nTerraform, sorry, your TypeScript is a\nprogram that executes, right? And it\nexposes some functionality to that\nprogram that you write that can do\nthings like\ncustom or tailor make tailor my\nTerraform or my my provider resource\nconfiguration to the target. So it does\nlike it it's called environment agnostic\nor um environment aware setups. If you\ngive it information about the target\nenvironment, it can actually uh provide\num details. Oh, sorry. Uh I just have to\nreply to someone.\n>> So so that that it does it does that's\nthe power of puli to me. um that you're\n>> the the question in my mind when I\napproached the Palumi desk was like I\nguess I was coming from an AI\nuh perspective in the sense that like\nsince Palumi offers different language\nbindings and of course it does straight\nup YAML what would be the best language\nfor\nuh AI to use given all those choices and\nthe guy interestingly said like it\ndoesn't matter it doesn't matter it\ndoesn't matter\nwhich I thought was quite curious\n>> he said it doesn't matter like what is\nthe best language to like the front end\nthe the interface that you use to define\nyour infrastructure\n>> yeah like he said he was basically\nimplying that it wasn't it didn't matter\nif it was go yaml\n>> okay he was a saleserson\n>> well I think he kind of he kind of made\nsome arguments to me like I think that\nessentially when it all goes through\npaleumi It gets\n>> no because they even have like a full\nfull declarative interface, right? Which\nis um\n>> yeah, you can even define but to me\nthat's weird because YAML is always\ngoing to be like this domain specific\nlanguage type of approach.\n>> I guess he was implying that once you've\n>> thrown it into the Palumi whatever it\ngets it gets found out. I don't really\nknow but yeah I thought it was\ninteresting.\n>> I I also don't really know the details\nthere because one of the major drawbacks\nabout AWS CDK and the gsi ecosystem is\nthat you get a lot more capabilities\nwhen you write in Typescript because you\ncan make libraries or reusable\ncomponents in Typescript and then you\ncan consume them in Python or Node. Oh\nsorry in Python or Java or Golang or Net\nso you can generate\n>> but you can't make you can't go the\nother way.\nYeah, because all that gsi does is it\njust creates a binding uh from the other\nlanguages that under the hood calls\nJavaScript and you can't go the other\nway. You can't create a binding from the\nother languages back into TypeScript. So\nlike when I was evaluating it for like\nteams to work with, one of the things\nthat we do with CDK AWS uh Terraform\nCDK, what we do is we we're building\nreusable components like L2s. like I I I\nhave a common L2 library, but then the\nteams they're actually building type of\nvery customized L3s which are like very\nfocused on what they're trying to do and\nthey can do that in Typescript and then\nwe are publishing and consuming it and\ntranspiling it into uh Terapform\nconfiguration so it lands straight into\nour existing Terapform pipelines. So we\nhave all of our existing Atlantis, all\nof our existing Terraform modules and\nthey just neatly land side by side with\nno migration required. So if I\nunderstand you correctly, Vincent, you\nneed to write your your shared\nuh level two or three construct in in\nTypescript for it to be shared.\n>> Yes. Because like my whole my whole\npipeline is like you publish um an MPM\nlike code artifact private registry\npackage of your like I'm a product team,\nright? I have my um service definition\nwhich is an XJS or whatever uh or maybe\nit's just an expressjs or yes we are\ntypescript shop sorry um and and then or\na lambdas right because actually it\napplies much more to lambdas like let's\nsay that I am a product team and I have\na very serverless um solution that uses\nSQS SNS um and all this like bucket\nnotifications and lambdas and all that\nand and so I need to produce re reusable\nartifact that I can then deploy in my\ndev environ environment uh first you\nknow my sandbox evaluation environment\nand then my staging environment with\nmore integration points with other um\nyou know existing uh staging resources\nso I am producing a bundle uh an\nartifact that is actually a library it's\nan it's an IC little library and and the\nintegration\n>> IC IC library what what's that mean\n>> infrastructure as code library\n>> oh okay sir\n>> like a TF module is is kind of like a\nbundle or library right except you um\nyou don't really have the capabilities\nof defining strong interfaces and also\nthe library can't the module can't\nreally u modify itself depending on the\ntarget environment right whereas if I am\num in in Typescript\n>> the interfaces that I get are like\nstrongly typed and I have like I I can\neven create imperative type of\nreconfiguration like that the whole\nthing can can adjust itself towards its\ntarget and there's pros and cons right\nbecause the more flexible the more you\nget like um you know validation like\nmechanisms now I need to I have like a\nbigger interface right because I have\nmore ways I can be configured then more\nthings I need to test for the the the\ndifferent configuration\n>> exposure\n>> the\n>> the other thing that was demoed to me\nwith the Palumi just getting back to the\nPalumi thing was that\n>> um yeah their SAS offering seemed pretty\nrobust you know they had secrets\nmanagement they had stack management\n>> I mean I I I don't know if Terraform I\nmean the last time I used Terraform\ncloud or Terraform I don't know\nworkspaces or whatever it's called\nnowadays\nthey feel I mean is IBM even supporting\nit anymore because it doesn't seem to\nchange\n>> this was always the biggest problem of\n>> I don't get it like why why buy\nTerraform if you're not going to\n>> yeah I mean even the ter the cash cow\nyou know what I mean like\n>> I don't get it\n>> well IBM just been iterating on it\nrecently and Maybe part of deprecating\nCDKTF is to ensure that they can focus\non other areas. Although that there was\na skeleton crew on CDKTF. I don't think\nit actually took any of their headcount.\nBut it's a good thing they got rid of of\nthat that team. Not they got rid of the\nteam. They got rid of the product. Uh\nthe team is still there. The team moved\non. They work on more of the like core\nfeatures.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. But but go back to the Terraform\ncloud uh and the Terraform enterprise.\nOne of the biggest issues with Hashior\nCorp always and even Grab in Singapore\nwas leveraging Atlantis an open source\nsolution against Hashi Cororb saying\nlike look you're asking for this much\nmoney and I can get like most of it out\nof Atlantis in a more customizable way.\n>> Yeah. So, so they did hire the guy um\nyou know Luke Kaslau and um the other\nguy I forgot. Uh he's he's he's actually\nhead of product of of one component. um\nMikail he did I saw his presentation on\non Hashi Kate but but what I'm trying to\nsay is that they always lacked in in the\nexecution level of of the cloud solution\nand Pulumi is very strong there you know\nour by\n>> yeah it's really good the I did ask them\nthat like so you have multiple stacks do\nyou have like a dependency tree and the\nguy conceded that they didn't to my\nsurprise the outputs are strings\n>> like what what what grid does you mean\nsomething or or or what's it scon or\nwhatever you call it.\n>> No, what I do with grit which is like\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Well, you do grit but you\nyou were inspired by tacons or something\nweren't you or something. I mean it's\nterri ticons is my project. I was doing\ngrit. Tons I was inspired by open taco.\n>> Open taco. That's that's the one. Yeah.\nBut like but yeah I I mean we talked\nabout it last podcast and I like\nstrongly typed shift left like we have\nthat now. What's the next thing? Better\ndependency management with\ninfrastructure, right? I mean,\n>> yes,\n>> maybe.\n>> But it's very hard because like\n>> the argument that I hear the most from\nTerra team and state graph is that this\nis very hard to achieve with\ninfrastructure because you can't\nvalidate that your network rules work\ncorrect unless you actually deploy it\ninto that particular environment. And\nthere's always a difference because of\nthe side range differences and all. And\nso that's kind of like where they they\nsay you can't fast your infrastructure.\nIt's not the same as software delivery.\nAnd I can see that in a way. But I think\nif you have a strong language and you\nhave like strong interfaces, you can do\na lot more you can get a lot more\nconfidence in in the fact that you know\nit's going to work the way you expected.\n>> Well, I think it's yeah problem yet to\nbe solved. At least I haven't seen it\nsolved. I mean I've\n>> if you believe I should try your grid uh\nyour vibe code.\n>> Yeah.\nthe grid is great. Um,\n>> are you using it in production?\n>> I guess your your your attention is has\nbeen starved. You know, you're focusing\n>> so I have not I mean I I I have it\ndeployed in a PC repo with the intention\nof other people to validate it um in my\norganization but we haven't been able to\npromote it again because of like you\nknow\n>> cost cutting exercises across the board\nin every company that I talked to. I did\nI didn't see the the flow in Palumi\nactually. I was cuz it was like you know\ndidn't you didn't have a computer. We're\njust talking face to face. The other but\nthe the demo that kind of blew me away\nwas not a plume\n>> system initiative.\n>> No no not the system initiative.\n>> I can talk we can talk about that a\nlittle bit later.\n>> The demo that blew me away was the um so\nso qlang is like pickle. you define your\nconfig in a fancy fancy language.\n>> You got to choose which one. You don't\nknow. You can't you can't\n>> Well, I'm to be honest, I'm I'm leaning\ntowards Qang just because of some of\nquality of life aspect. So, the cool\nthing about Qang is like I don't know\nthat it changed the config, you know,\nlike scaled the memory, had more CPUs,\nand then it and then of course it can\nhook into pretty much anything. But they\nshowed a demo when it it did a terraform\nplan. And the cool thing about that was\nthat when the Terraform plan came back,\nit fed back into the Qang. So you could\nso you could actually see the change\nwithout like look, you know, like when\nyou do a plan, it's just like bloody\ninsane. And the cool thing about it, I\nhope I'm trying to explain it correctly,\nwas that is that it summarized the plan\nin a way that was like operationally\nsane like yeah, you've changed this and\nthat's and and that's because of this\nconfig change you and this plan cor like\nworks out how it is and then I I think\nthey've I'm not too sure if they\nimplemented it uh quite yet, but then\nthere's things in the works like the\napproval gates and things like I mean\nthis This is something that we struggle\nwith at my workplace is like we're\nchanging Terraform like we have to\ncontrol how it's done the audited\nwhether it's deleted whether it's\nupdated replaced we have to we have to\nunderstand what's going on because\nreading plans is just or there is this\nTF summarizer that we use but it's still\na nightmare. So the cool thing about\nthis was that it in the PR it like spun\nup a Q lang thing. I didn't even know\nyou could do this and it was just really\nfast and and nice. It was like\n>> but this is a framework on Qang. This is\nsome like this is a bunch of tools that\nthey built on top of Qang.\n>> Yeah, something like that. It's like a Q\nlang. I think they call it Q hub.\n>> Okay. I haven't heard about this.\n>> That that demo was impressive. But then\nand then some some other guy from\nUbisoft was giving a demo where I've\nnever quite seen this concept before but\nhe gave like I mean it was a bit\ncontrived but he gave the scenario where\nhe needs he's imagining like a thousand\nusers and then given a thousand users\nthen you can can say that given what the\napplication does you need you know a\nthousand megabytes of RAM and then and\nthen um and then basically\nthis model of how your application works\nbecomes config and then also that model\ngets confirmed in the observability. So\nyou have this sort of feedback loop\nbetween what's deployed, what's being\nobserved, what's your model, what's\nbeing deployed and you you go you go\nfrom there. And then of course he uses Q\nlang as a way of marking that all up so\nthat everything comes together and and\nand further validates the model. I\nthought that was I thought that was\nreally interesting. I've never I've\nnever seen it done that way before. But\nlike\n>> that's interesting. But like my problem\nwith all of these custom like I\nunderstand that a lot of organizations\nlike Google they even invented Qang\nspecifically to manage the problem of\nconfiguration. um meaning that you don't\nhave a full-fledged programming language\nfor configuration management. That's why\nthey built Quolang. That's why Apple has\nPickle. Um\n>> but I still I mean I think that's not\nnot a bad idea, right? Um the fact that\nthen you can use QAN to manage\nconfiguration like the same reason why\nJSONet exists, right? JSONet is a\nlanguage to basically, you know,\nimperatively kind of control the JSON\nconfigurations that you're trying to\ngenerate.\n>> Um but\nMy issue and I think I tried to tell\nthis to you as well when you send me\nsome of this this stuff is like great\nyou know that's yet another way of doing\nthe same thing on top of ter\nresources. Yeah, you're inventing a new\nthing. But the same way like with the\nsystem initiative, you're just creating\nanother way of, you know, doing CRUD on\nresources and that's not the problem,\nright? Doing CRUD on resources.\n>> Well, I wouldn't I mean that's a bit\nunfair because I I mean I think Q is\ntrying to get that one pager that over\nwhat that one pager of your of your\napplication system thing, right? Sorry,\nI can't I'm not too sure. Sorry, I can\ndo I can do one page.\nthat with my hands\nit's not trying to uh do CRUD operations\nof course like the interesting thing I\nwas talking to some of the QAN guys like\nyou know\n>> but you you delegate the problem you\ndelegate the CRUD to the to the to the\nterraform provider right as long as you\ndon't as you leverageing providers you\nget all of the\n>> CR but in an ideal world things would\nwould great I mean this is the way I\nunderstood what he was saying in an\nideal world things would vastly improve\nif you could actually give that whole\nconfig to the the cloud service provider\ninstead of doing all these CRUD\noperations because there's so much\ncomplexity in that Terraform provider.\nThere's so much stuff going on with all\nthose CRUD operations. In an ideal\nworld, you could just give the\ndeclarative config and that's that I I\nmean that's what we want to move\n>> which is what kind of like Kubernetes\npromises, right? You give it config\n>> and that's what crossplane also\npromises. You have to have a whole cloud\ncontrol layer like within Kubernetes. I\nwas chatting with a Kubernetes guy and I\nmean we all know this stuff but like but\nI just think it was I don't know maybe\nit's just a gig that I'm on like he was\nsaying like yeah when you when you put\nyour CPUs and your memory definitions\nand your deployment uh YAML the idea is\nthat you deploy it into your environment\nand then you constantly refine it\nknowing what the application\n>> okay was that was that was that um is\nthat the guy okay I can guess who Daniel\nwas that Danielle\n>> no it wasn't Daniel it was Okay,\n>> it was another guy. But but I thought to\nmyself, it's like this is so weird\nbecause or foreign to me because we have\nso like in my workplace we have so many\nenvironments\nand there's a pro promotion environment\nand like it's very very hard to nail\ndown the the resource limits. Anyway,\n>> yeah. So I just thought there's this\ncube learn uh from Daniel. They do some\nreally interesting like visualizations\nof how Kubernetes worked. They even got\nsome gigs where they they trained Apple\nuh engineers to on on communities. And\none of the recent things that he was\nreally into was to like how do you\nevaluate the actual you know resource\nrequirements of your deployments and he\nasked a lot of questions and spend a lot\nof time trying to see because they added\nnow they added virtual pod autoscaling\nas well. So before you could only like\nadd more pods, but now you can actually\nwith the control group V2, you can\nactually resize the number of CPU and\nmemory you give a pot without recreating\nthe pot, which is insane, right? And and\nand if you have those capabilities, then\nyou can like dynamically resize your CPU\nand memory.\n>> I still I still think it's pretty\ninsane in a way. I mean like\n>> Yeah, but um I mean that's just one\napplication level. Hold on. Wait up.\nWait up. Wait up. Wait up. I just need\nsome water.\nBut these are all the dials and knobs\nthat you get with Kubernetes, right? And\nthe problem for me is YAML the way to\ndeclaratively define it's insane. Then\nyou build languages on top like Q that\nbasically I I don't know do they use\nbecause cuz doing a demo from what you\njust said, right? He said Q is great if\nonly we could give it directly to the\nprovider uh directly to the cloud\nservice right and without having to go\nthrough these providers with all their\nlegacy assumptions. And then we\ndiscussed Kubernetes is a cloud\ncontroller interface that gives you the\nability to declaratively define a very\nyou know\n>> yeah I mean the guy behind Q is like the\nthe same guy behind uh Kubernetes\nactually. So I guess that's why he says\nstuff like that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Well, if they built a\nconfiguration front end that uses Qang\nand then is able to manage the YAML um I\nguess great but um that's still\nI mean you still need a cluster to\ndeploy it and then yes maybe you can be\nuh like like up upbound which is the\ncrossplane SAS um basically we provide\nyou the cluster so you don't have to run\nyour own clusters and then you just work\npurely with crossplane so you just um\ndefine all\n>> no not crossplane Oh, getting\nsidetracked here. Okay, let's\n>> No, because you were talking about um\nyou know basically a control loop on top\nof the cloud service and an uniform\ncontrol loop and that's what crossplane\nis, right? They're a unifor uniform\ncontrol loop on top of the um\n>> Yeah, but Kubernetes or something. I\nmean, if you want to go\n>> what are you talking about when you like\nif you need to provision SQSQs and\ntopics and buckets?\n>> Oh, okay. You want to still do AWS?\nOkay. Yeah. Okay. I think I got you. I\ngot you. Yeah.\n>> Not necessarily AWS. I mean, any cloud\nthat you're using, you're still using\nmanaged services, right?\n>> Uh oh, God. Sorry. Well, let let's let's\ngo back to AI. Did Did you Did you Did\nyou see\n>> because that was part of your prompt\nlike\n>> did you see Adam did you see Adam Jacobs\ntalk? Did I did I share it with you?\n>> Uh is are they online? I don't know why\nI didn't.\n>> Yeah, it's online. Yeah, it was it was\ngood.\n>> Okay, that's good. Yeah. No, but like\nyou give me some notes where you you\nsaid like um it's going to be so much\ncode that we cannot control it and our\nrole is more towards validation. I mean\nI've hear the same thing for\n>> spot checking\n>> everyone I talk to.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> I think those are like Yeah. If you use\nthe AI you kind of like you got to be\nblind if you don't see that.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think everyone's coming to this\nconclusion.\n>> Yeah. the I you know what one thing I've\nalways found very polarizing in my\ncareer is sllock like source lines of\ncode and he basically just came up guns\nfiring saying that like that with AI you\ncan output 50k lines of code and he I\nthe point he was trying to make is that\nlike the force multiplier the utility\nthe uh the what AI can do is absolutely\ninsane\nand um I I mean 50k I mean what what is\n50k? It means nothing. It just but it\nmeans it's just it's just a number.\n>> I mean people just refer to that like\n>> huh\n>> Boris when he talks about all of the\ncode to plot code he he just says like\n500 PRs a week or something. It's all\nmanaged different.\n>> So yeah, he was he was talking about the\nvelocity. The velocity Yeah. My take\naway from his talk was that the velocity\nis now absolutely bananas\nand now the bottleneck is\ninfrastructures code because because\nbecause all that velocity needs to run\non some service. So we need to match\nthat velocity with the way that we\nprovide infrastructure as code. So yeah,\nit had me thinking like what is slow in\nmy organization like oh my god you know\nPRs are slow um our CDK stack\ndeployments and everything like that the\ncoordination and the releases is slow\nthe promotion is slow\n>> there's so much slow slowness in at\nleast\nin my in my workplace I find um for\ndifferent re not not just technological\nreasons I would say mostly\norganizational and approval\nreasons everything is so slow in my in\nmy client.\n>> Mhm. So yeah, it got me thinking and\nthis is why I was asking questions like\nlike\nnow I'm now I'm looking at my\ninfrastructures code pipeline and just\nthinking like like how can I make this\nfast\nso that um so I mean like I don't when\nyou develop with AI are you doing a\nTerraform plan and apply or or CDK\ndeploy and apply and and like don't you\nfeel that that's a bit slow or maybe\nwe're we're looking at the Oh\n>> no, because one of the things that you\nhighlighted in that Golang architecture\nfor AWS or that that cloud gave you was\nlike deployment time with AWS CDK is\nfast just CDK deploy. I think that's one\nof the main criticisms I hear about CDK\nis that you know cloud formation is so\nextremely slow. Um you know because it\ngoes and and it gives you this\ntransactional uh guarantees like it's\nall or nothing. So it starts to deploy,\nit starts to create backups, it try\nstarts to do all of this additional\nstuff and then if anything goes wrong,\nit does guarantee the full roll back\nwhich is super frustrating\n>> which never seems\n>> super frustrating work because then you\nhave something left behind then\nsomething you know prevents it from\nbeing destroyed and and it doesn't work\nright. Um\n>> but\n>> but that's the thing that you don't get\nwith terraform right when you run a fly\num if it doesn't go through totally it\njust left like that right and then\nyou're left to to figure it out it goes\nvery fast right it going to create\ndestroy everything and then it go like\nwhoop uh actually we're stuck good luck\nand there's no guarantee on on the roll\nback right which is what you don't get\nuh with terafform it does make\neverything feel much faster because you\nhave these individual resources all\ngetting created super fast but you're\nthen you don't have the transactional\nguant guarantee right so that was one of\nthe things that I was trying to solve\nwith my friend when we were uh because\nhe heavily relied on this cloud\nformation guarantee uh doing cross\nregional deploys because that's another\ngreat thing about cloud formation it's\nbasically available in every region so\nyou want to do a cross regional deploy\njust kick it off and it goes um but then\nwhen we looking at like moving over to\nTerraform we we are like oh [ __ ] now we\nare responsible because we're like like\nthe fly.io IO right now we are\nresponsible for like what if the\ndeployment failed how do we roll back\nand I'm like yeah I can't tell you you\nknow could be so many reasons why ter I\njust had the thought that um I made a\nvideo about this a month ago or two I\njust had the thought that like\ndata aside what probably works best for\nAI is just having its own AWS account\nwhich it just bootstraps from from\nscratch and when that AWS account\nbecomes comes crofty. It just basically\ndeletes it AWS account.\n>> Nukes it.\n>> Nukes it and starts a new one. What is\nthat? There's probably a name for it.\nIt's uh I don't know like\n>> ephemeral.\n>> Pardon?\n>> Sounds ephemeral.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Ephemeral. Yeah. I think AI\nneeds more ephemeral environments. Oh,\nbut in my current workplace, just\ngetting an account vended is really\nreally really really hard. No. And I I\ndon't know how we can even close it. But\nyeah, a firmware environment surely\nseems like an an AI friendly pattern.\n>> Well, everything has data. You know, the\nbiggest problem with environments is\ndata. You know, how do you like even\nreplicate or even when I want to do a\nfull integration test with with full QA\nautomation end to end? How do I get\nrealistic data? Do I have seats for\neverything? Do I replicate production\ndata? Do I, you know, mask out all of\nthe information like some\nquestion. Yeah, I don't think anyone\nreally talked about data and AI, but\nthat was probably the missing piece of\nthe puzzle for me.\n>> Another we have a job. If this was all\nsolved, we wouldn't have a job,\n>> I suppose. God, you sound really\nBelgian. Um, maybe it's all the Flemish\nI'm hearing. I one other demo before\nbefore I need to probably run out\nscreaming is um which I found really\ninteresting and that really proves the\ncat is out the bag was this guy was\nshowing that his new framework laptop\nwith the AI Max chipset and\ninterestingly he had like he had like I\ndon't know\n>> open clocks\n>> he had 180i he had 128 gigs of RAM or\nsomething and the cool thing he said is\nthat this new AMD Mac AI max one the\nUSPS. One of the key features is that\nyou can dedicate your RAM to the GPU and\nmake your GPU even more powerful.\n>> So he basically KVMED into his machine\nwhich didn't have any internet. And then\nhe he's also the author of era which is\nlike this uh anible playbook um sort of\nUI where it like logs how long the AI\nplaybook took to run and what the inputs\nwere and and what the logs were. So\nbasically he managed to configure his\nhis framework desktop to diagnose\nfailing playbooks\nand he was just using you know Alama and\nuh I don't know the GP GPT\nwhatever or the Z or what I don't\nwhatever local models\n>> GM\n>> and it was just ch it was just steaming\nthrough all these playbook errors and\nfixing things you know missing updating\n>> local models nice\n>> yeah updating Postgress libraries,\nfixing errors.\n>> It wasn't a prepared demo at all.\n>> Huh?\n>> It was probably Postgress from 5 years\nago. Well, within the training database\nof the of the local maybe, maybe.\n>> Just kidding. I'm just kidding.\n>> But the the demo was compelling because\nu you know how it is. It's like or you\ndon't want to use AI because it's you\nknow uh it's only used to be become\ndependent on anthropic and open AI. But\nno, hell no. This shows that we have the\nability to run it locally. Of course,\nthe model the model is not as capable as\nclaude, but it's damn well the cat is\n>> but think about it.\n>> Those local models now are like 04\ncapabilities and 04 like chain of think\nof of of thinking.\n>> Why you say 04? I mean, okay, whatever.\nbecause they they they do compare like\nthe the uh GPT OSS are equal to 04 is\nGPT04 like the the first\n>> reason I think 34 I mean the whole\nbloody versioning thing doesn't really\nmake sense but like\n>> yeah it was 01 04 because they went GPT3\nGPT4 then 01 then 04\n>> even even six month or one year old\nmodels at this point are actually pretty\ncapable for some for some tasks\n>> so yeah like so like Of course, anyone\nthat's listening to us right now, I\nwould say that like the best model at\nthe moment is the Claude Anthropic 4.5\nOpus or or SA. It's\n>> So, you just got a sponsorship, is it?\n>> No, this is # notsponsored. It's It's\nlike It's $20 a month to get on pro. Of\ncourse, you get limited quite heavily if\nyou do anything hardcore, but like like\nguys, the sun is shining. The sun is\nshining. Make hay.\n>> Wait, you're in uh in Belgium and the\nsun is shining. I can imagine you're\nhappy.\n>> I think there's something something\ngoing weird. Is Is the AI Did the AI do\nthis? Is the AI listening?\n>> So, there's this that happened. Um\nOh [ __ ] Is there sensitive information\nhere? Probably just\n>> your your locations maybe. Hmc.\n>> Um what is this? Oh,\nyou now you you're now a big boy wearing\nbig boy pants.\n>> Just up just upgraded this morning. I\nfelt like I'm\n>> Have you Have you already hit the limits\nknowing you?\n>> No, no, no, no, no, no. I was I was\nrunning out of limits on pro every week\nlike within 3 days and I was like that's\nit. I need I need for the next few weeks\nI have quite a lot of things to I have\nto do and I need\n>> I'd be curious if you hit the limits cuz\nit's like it's that classic isn't it?\nIt's like you get the back now. Now\nyou're over overprovisioned and now\nyou're like thinking, \"Oh, I'm not using\nit enough.\"\n>> Yeah, I know. This is definitely going\nto lead to some burnout.\nSo, yeah, I'm um I'm probably going to\nyou're probably going to have to cut\nsome vision like put some black boxes\nsome places because I just showed part\nof my credit card. I don't know if that\nwas going to help you with the last four\ndigits of your credit card.\n>> Yeah, it's true. And it's also there's\nno money on it.\nBut that's not how credit cards work.\n>> Max plan. I can just imagine like people\npanhandling on the streets.\n>> I need money for my max pan.\n>> Hey, you're kidding. But I do think that\nthat's what's going to happen next.\n>> No, no, no. I mean, I was just going to\nbecome elite.\n>> What?\n>> It's going to become only accessible to\nsome people.\nWell, when you talk about panhandling, I\nI I really think some people are not\ngoing to get access anymore.\n>> Come on. My earlier story was supposed\nto point out that for for four grand,\nyou can basically get a less capable\nmodel, but run it locally.\n>> For four grand of hardware,\n>> that's only four grand he spent.\n>> Yeah, the framework laptop is 4,000\nCanadian or something.\n>> Okay. Okay, that's not too bad. So, you\ncould argue that, you know, with the\nmoney I spend every month, I could have\njust bought and depreciated it. I still\ndon't think it's the same, though. Um,\n>> yeah, it's difficult like, yeah,\n>> you know what? What convinced me to to\nbump it up? Not just that I was hitting\nthe limits on Pro, but also that the\nrecent cloud code announcements. So,\nthey added um like task dependencies.\nSo, you basically have beats built into\ncloud code, right? The ability\n>> Oh, that's all that's all in cloud code\nright now. Yeah. Like since I've been\nsince I've been in a conference for a\nweek, I feel like I missed a month's\nworth of announcements.\n>> What did I miss?\n>> So So I I should share with you the\nvideo from the guy who used to do\nspeckit at Microsoft and he now he's now\nanthropic, right? Dan I forgot his last\nname, Dan de Demen something. Um and he\njust broke down the future of cloud\ncode, right? He he's he's obviously very\nexperienced with like he highlights some\nof the techniques that you use and they\nare very very heavily used in in speckit\nwhich is um the templating um so\nbasically you give the model a template\nof what a plan looks like right and and\nspeckit does that when you run the\ncommand it executes a script and that\nscript prepares it template in the right\nplace and then it tells the model read\nit these are the things you need to do\nand it follows a template right so you\nget very consistent\n>> why do you call it a template I mean\nthat could be a skill couldn't Yeah. I\nmean, why do you\n>> what's the difference between a template\nand a skill?\n>> It's a combination because like now\nskill and commands, they're very\nsimilar. You can like invoke skills the\nsame way that you can invoke commands.\nSo, what used to be a command has been\nrenamed to skills. So, skills and he\ncalls it the templates approach because\non one side you have a skill that gives\nyou instructions of the steps to follow,\nbut on the other side you have a\ntemplate of the actual artifact that you\nwant to produce. If you're talking\nspecifically about plans and and tasks\nand execution of what your agents are\ngoing to do, you need to have a certain\num you know level of information within\nthese specifications that the agents can\ndo it correctly without um confusion.\nRight? So the the biggest issue is um if\nyou do VIPE coding, you are missing\nintent and you're missing some of the\nlike you're you're letting the model\nmake assumptions and you're leaving some\nof the edge cases out without your\ndecision and that leads to unexpected\nresults. So when you are following this\ntemplate model, you are capturing those\nrequirements and you are eliminating\nthose assumptions and those um blurry\nlines. So so that's part of the spec\nkit. Uh and\n>> I guess the template implies that things\nneed to be captured perhaps.\n>> Yes, the template has your minimum\nrequirements and he doesn't do only the\ntemplate because he also adds on top\nthat you have the hook validation hook.\nSo when the agent walked worked through\nthe template and captured all of the\ninformation according to the template\nand the task and the user specification\nthen there's a validation hook like he\nuses actually um the one that you\nmentioned like the the Astra TY the type\nthing. He actually validates that the\nthe template has the attributes um\ndeterministically like this particular\nspecification documents or requirements\ndocuments has this section this section\nthis section are all valid it doesn't\nyou know validate the contents but it\nvalidates the section exists uh and\nthat's also what ko does right when you\nare you know building your your your\nplan to to to feed it to agents to\nexecute because ko is all about the\nupfront planning everyone that uses AI\nlately they all say you spend 80% time\nup front planning 20% of the time is is\nthe agent executing right that that\nexecution load like what what Adam just\nsaid as well it's just generated just\ngoes on right and your job as a human\nwith your limited amount of effective\nhours and attention span you are um in\nin in charge of like making the critical\ndecisions\n>> Adam Adam was saying that we all need to\nread the u the domain driven design book\nwhich I think is written by like um a\nthought worker um 100% or ex thought\nworker. I mean have you have you ever\nactually dived into domain uh driven\ndesign yourself?\n>> Yeah there so many times I've wanted to\nand I've never really spent a lot of\ntime on it. So like anyway with with all\nthe specit stuff we I mean you missed\nthe specit to me did you find the stuff\nany improving I guess it's just more and\nmore integrated with clawed code right\nit's nothing\n>> yeah so the guy who built who who wrote\nlarge parts of specket and you know\niterated through a lot of the prompts\nand set this all up aside from the idea\nhe worked with someone at Microsoft that\ncame up like that that that lead led\nwith the idea he's the guy that actually\nbuilt the specket now at Mantropic he's\nintroducing a lot of these\nfeatures on top of the cloud code suite.\nSo if you watch his video, it's not on\nhis um official channel like he has a\nseparate channel which is like um how\nyou call like indie dan. Yeah, that's\nhis because like independent it's it's\nlike\n>> oh\n>> and yeah and there he actually goes down\nhe talks about the validation hooks he\ntalks about the template uh approach and\nthen he talks about my god\n>> yes and then he talks about the agent\nsystem because you were able to do\nagents but the the co coordination\nsystem was bad right I told you I tried\nI I had all of my plans worked out I had\nidentified parallel tasks perfect for\nparallel agents right because there's no\nway that these agents will step on each\nother's toes if they're completely\nworking on separate parallel tasks.\nWrong. Cuz there was assumptions in\nthere in in the in the tasks in the\ncontext that they got which was like\nthere's this shared library and each one\nof them implemented the shared library\nand things like that. Um so that\nrequires coordination between agents uh\nand and like Gasttown and others they\nuse agent mail and more traditional\nsystems of like agents messaging each\nother and I think they're building\nGasttown now directly into cloud code.\nSo that's why I upgraded because I felt\nlike Opus is not going to like my my my\nbasic access to Opus is not going to cut\nit.\n>> Okay. There's a there's a lot going on\nhere. So do you still use beads is what\nis was at the top of my mind?\n>> At the moment I am uh because what I'm\nworking with is something cloud code\nindependent but I also feel that I\nupgraded because I wanted to see what\nthis is going to be. you know this thing\nthat then uh showcased where he\nhighlighted some of the core concepts\nthat I see in in specket reapplied into\ncloud code and the concept of agent\nswarm directly in cloud code I felt that\num I don't know if I will be using beats\nin that scenario right uh I talked to\nother people they they use GitHub issues\nand other stuff like that um\n>> so does this t I mean have you played\nwith this crawl code or has it just been\nannounced is it live like does it save\nthe tasks to to some to some database or\nto some\n>> it has its task like it has it memory\nsystem so it has the ability to save\ntask across sessions that's one of the\nfeatures of this new task system\n>> because it is it able to do what beads\ndoes like you know\n>> it has dependency it has the ability to\ndefine this task locks test task and\nthings like that\n>> yeah it they build all of that into\ncloud code now so if you if you consider\nall of that the reason to use beats\nbecomes a loss less if you are go full\nin onto cloud code So that's kind of\nlike where I'm I'm I'm feeling out.\nThat's why I want to explore\n>> because I remember talking to you and\nyou were like getting uh Gemini to\nreview the output from claw code. Those\nsort of workflows are going to I guess\nbecome harder and harder to do if you go\nall in, right?\n>> One of the thing the points that Theo\nmade about the move from Entropic to not\nallow people to use their subscription\noutside of cloud code and and\neffectively shut down anyone that does\nand ban their accounts. um is because\nthey want to make it very sticky, right?\nThey not the model alone is not the and\nI think we know Opus by itself is just\non par with the toolkit that they want\nyou to stick to. So that's why they are\nlike building the toolkit.\n>> Yeah, it seems sad though and\n>> yeah, it would be very like I also I\nalways said like I keep my options open.\nI don't go following full in on any of\nthem. But with the recent evolution and\nthe way that Antropic is leading and I\nalso think like I think KO is actually\nbecause AWS has invested into Antropic I\ndon't know how Kir is affected by this\num you know this this decision of how\nyou get to use the model but KO uses\nentropic models right um so I think Kiru\nmight have an edge there but I still\nfeel you know I still feel cloud code is\nlike ahead even though that most people\nhate the leadership of Antropic\nwith with all of his, you know, like\neven even\n>> Well, it's a bit anti-competitive, but I\nguess they're trying to build they're\ntrying to build a moat. Trying to build\na moat.\n>> Yeah. And they're like, you know, don't\nsell GPU to China. That's an like and\nall that. Like they're very vocal about\nthose things. And\n>> what about other announcements? I mean,\nI I mean, I can't help but think be a\n>> Yeah, I'm being a shenan friend to open\nAI. They don't seem to do anything that\nseems to capture my attention lately.\n>> Yeah. So, I shared with a friend that I\njust went in on on Max and he's like,\n\"What are you doing?\" Because OpenAI\njust uh you know, double.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. They just released this new UI and\nand and Tio did like a very nice uh\nbreakdown um comparing it. Uh like I I\nused to complain a lot about Teio, but I\nthink I I\n>> Did he did he do an honest thing and say\nthis is junk and open AI and Claude is\n>> No. Yeah, he he had to he had to frame\nhis video very heavily with like I am\nnot being paid by OpenAI blah blah blah\nblah blah but Codex is amazing.\n>> Um so it was interesting to see he\nbasically said they took all of the good\nstuff of anti-gravity which is the agent\nmanagement and they made it accessible\nin codeex so that you can run multiple\nagents across work trees. They made the\nability to use work trees more intuitive\nso you can see all of the work trees\nthat exist and switch between them very\neasily.\n>> Have you tried Have you tried it\nyourself?\n>> No, I only watched\nIt looked like a very It looked like a\nco-work ripoff on the face of it. I\nmean, it looked\n>> okay. I haven't tried co-work.\n>> It just looked like another like fat\nelectron app. It looked very uninspiring\nto me.\n>> Okay. So, a lot of like So, somebody\ntold me like, \"Hey, Open AI just doubled\nthe usage limits because I was like, but\nwhen I I went from Pro, I went to max,\nwhich is five times my usage limit, but\nof course at um three times the cost. Um\nbut um Oh, no. Is it It is actually\nfive. Wait,\n>> it said five I think it said 5x on your\nearlier share.\n>> Yeah, it says 5x usage, but the cost is\nalso not triple. I think it's also more\nthan anyway doesn't matter.\n>> 5x decision\nproductivity.\n>> It's like no buyers remorse here.\n>> No buyers remorse here. No impulse\ndecision.\n>> And\n>> okay, cool. I have to go also.\n>> Okay, you have to go. But like talking\nspeaking of buyers remorse, I I did find\nit very interesting. A colleague said to\nme that like Claude is basically making\nyou feel like you're at a gambling\nmachine. It make it's making it\naddictive to do the thing. And I think\nyou might be addicted, Vincent. You\nmight be hooked by\n>> is this an intervention? If the next\ncall I join and there's five people on\nthe call, I'm going and my wife\n>> when says it was a great idea. Maybe it\nwasn't Vincent. That's all I'm saying.\nWhen you when you started saying using\ncloud is like a gambling machine, my\ninitial reaction was this guy never\nheard of specit. This guy doesn't know\nhow to how to you know get the quality\ncontrol if he cannot control.\n>> Oh okay. No no I mean it is very\naddictive this whole stuff. Okay. See\nyou. Thanks for the chat. I'll publish\nthis sometime.\n>> Enjoy K. Enjoy the sunshine.\n>> Thank you. Bye.",

I I miss Kent.\n[0:12] >> Yeah, it's actually it's pretty good. I\n[0:15] just I just been enjoying walking around\n[0:18] actually. It's been fun. And the\n[0:19] architecture is pretty amazing. Like I'm\n[0:22] confused cuz I I always thought to\n[0:24] myself that like\n[0:28] I don't know that that um\n[0:32] that Europe is\n[0:35] dying.\n[0:36] >> Well, yeah. Exactly. But like the\n[0:38] buildings there are quite wellmaintained\n[0:40] and rich. You know what I mean? It's\n[0:41] like confused.\n[0:43] >> If you believe certain politicians, it's\n[0:45] all you know run over by crime. And\n[0:50] >> maybe maybe that's still the case.\n[0:52] >> Yeah. And there's a lot of like um you\n[0:55] know young beautiful people walking\n[0:59] around and uh\n[1:02] Yeah. It's quite it's quite different to\n[1:03] London. I'd say\n[1:06] >> cuz I'm old now. See why hair cannot be\n[1:09] there anymore.\n[1:10] >> I'm I'm freaking Gandalf right now, man.\n[1:13] >> Yeah. So yeah, Belgian's been great and\n[1:15] yeah, the conflict management camp was\n[1:17] good. I mean, I think it's actually the\n[1:18] best infrastructure conference on the\n[1:20] planet, I dare say.\n[1:22] >> Is it now?\n[1:23] >> And you missed out on\n[1:25] >> Yeah, I did uh fortunately um after some\n[1:29] information around holiday period, I had\n[1:32] to\n[1:33] >> lock in some uh contracts and deals and\n[1:36] it's been going great. So,\n[1:38] unfortunately, I couldn't make it to\n[1:39] config management camp, but I was able\n[1:40] to do different things.\n[1:42] >> So, this is all CDK ter was it CD? what\n[1:46] do you call your your\n[1:47] >> DDK terrain it's called now hey actually\n[1:49] your your your proposal of the Golang um\n[1:52] setup of a project and hosting on AWS\n[1:55] where on one side you evaluate cloud\n[1:56] form versus the AWS CLI and AWS CDK uh\n[2:00] but you're not evaluating Terraform in\n[2:02] there um you're comparing it against\n[2:05] cloud for\n[2:06] >> well that that plan that I sent you like\n[2:08] I\n[2:08] >> I I thought I wouldn't influence it that\n[2:11] much but I asked Claude\n[2:13] >> to give me what it wants to do.\n[2:16] >> And funny enough, it didn't mention\n[2:18] Terraform. Like I was I started the\n[2:20] prompt saying like\n[2:21] >> that's interesting.\n[2:22] >> Like what how would you\n[2:25] um and I I think I I should have shared\n[2:27] the prompt, shouldn't I? I think I was\n[2:29] opt I was optimizing for speed and\n[2:31] operational simplicity\n[2:33] and that's what and and CDK came up top.\n[2:36] So yeah.\n[2:38] >> Yeah. But like\n[2:40] >> even if you look at the data of that\n[2:42] like um report that was shared by Matt\n[2:45] Gawi um but it's it's AWS usage data\n[2:49] report about how people deploy on top of\n[2:52] AWS. Cloud formation was by far the the\n[2:55] highest used and then there was\n[2:57] Terraform right after and then there was\n[2:59] AWS CDK. You know, I I I find it funny\n[3:02] that you don't combine AWS CDK and cloud\n[3:04] for because it's the same, right? It's\n[3:06] cloud form. Uh except you have a better\n[3:09] interface when you use AWS CDK.\n[3:10] >> Well, I mean, not you like the the\n[3:12] people that that support.\n[3:15] >> Yeah. The I guess the winner for CDK is\n[3:18] the is the you know the shift left early\n[3:20] feedback because at at compile time\n[3:24] you should kind of know if if your code\n[3:26] is working, right?\n[3:28] >> Yeah.\n[3:29] >> Yeah. I mean and I think that\n[3:30] >> not 100% but like good enough.\n[3:33] >> You you I you you must have influenced\n[3:36] cloud to consider this as one of the\n[3:37] criteria fact of the compile time\n[3:39] checking or it's influenced by your\n[3:41] previous discussions.\n[3:43] >> Maybe maybe maybe\n[3:44] >> so I had a chat with the Palumi guys\n[3:48] at the desk at config management camp\n[3:51] yesterday. I was pretty impressed with\n[3:53] what they\n[3:53] >> they're doing really cool stuff. Yeah.\n[3:55] No, no. I have to say like if you\n[3:57] consider CDKTF and Pulumi as as like\n[4:00] competitors, I don't think that's true\n[4:01] because I I mean I was naive. I I did\n[4:04] originally consider them. Uh but then\n[4:06] somebody showed you know wisen me up and\n[4:08] and showed me some of the really cool\n[4:10] stuff because Pulumi is a host engine\n[4:13] that allows your um your infrastructure\n[4:16] code to hook into some really advanced\n[4:19] features that you can't do with\n[4:21] Terraform declarative configuration or\n[4:23] you can't do even with CDKTF unless you\n[4:26] have some type of like the the runtime\n[4:28] the host environment in which your your\n[4:31] TypeScript or Python or Golang you know\n[4:33] the host is is giving the\n[4:36] infrastructures code a lot of like\n[4:38] dynamic capabilities of lookup and AWS\n[4:41] CDK does some of that because you you do\n[4:43] have the CLI able to host\n[4:46] >> what do you mean the host like the their\n[4:48] SAS application what do you mean by host\n[4:50] >> no no no like the puli host so when you\n[4:52] run the when you run your infrastructure\n[4:54] configuration application it's an\n[4:56] application right when you run it in\n[4:58] puli it runs inside a host that runs\n[5:01] your\n[5:01] >> like the kubernetes model like desired\n[5:03] state is it why is it like that?\n[5:06] >> Uh no it's like you know because\n[5:08] ultimately puli uses the terapform\n[5:10] providers so under the hood at least\n[5:12] originally. So, so what what it does\n[5:15] give the program, you know, because your\n[5:18] Terraform, sorry, your TypeScript is a\n[5:20] program that executes, right? And it\n[5:23] exposes some functionality to that\n[5:27] program that you write that can do\n[5:29] things like\n[5:31] custom or tailor make tailor my\n[5:33] Terraform or my my provider resource\n[5:36] configuration to the target. So it does\n[5:38] like it it's called environment agnostic\n[5:40] or um environment aware setups. If you\n[5:42] give it information about the target\n[5:44] environment, it can actually uh provide\n[5:48] um details. Oh, sorry. Uh I just have to\n[5:52] reply to someone.\n[5:53] >> So so that that it does it does that's\n[5:56] the power of puli to me. um that you're\n[6:00] >> the the question in my mind when I\n[6:02] approached the Palumi desk was like I\n[6:05] guess I was coming from an AI\n[6:07] uh perspective in the sense that like\n[6:11] since Palumi offers different language\n[6:14] bindings and of course it does straight\n[6:16] up YAML what would be the best language\n[6:20] for\n[6:22] uh AI to use given all those choices and\n[6:26] the guy interestingly said like it\n[6:28] doesn't matter it doesn't matter it\n[6:30] doesn't matter\n[6:33] which I thought was quite curious\n[6:34] >> he said it doesn't matter like what is\n[6:36] the best language to like the front end\n[6:38] the the interface that you use to define\n[6:40] your infrastructure\n[6:41] >> yeah like he said he was basically\n[6:43] implying that it wasn't it didn't matter\n[6:45] if it was go yaml\n[6:48] >> okay he was a saleserson\n[6:51] >> well I think he kind of he kind of made\n[6:53] some arguments to me like I think that\n[6:55] essentially when it all goes through\n[6:57] paleumi It gets\n[6:59] >> no because they even have like a full\n[7:01] full declarative interface, right? Which\n[7:04] is um\n[7:05] >> yeah, you can even define but to me\n[7:07] that's weird because YAML is always\n[7:09] going to be like this domain specific\n[7:10] language type of approach.\n[7:12] >> I guess he was implying that once you've\n[7:14] >> thrown it into the Palumi whatever it\n[7:17] gets it gets found out. I don't really\n[7:20] know but yeah I thought it was\n[7:21] interesting.\n[7:22] >> I I also don't really know the details\n[7:24] there because one of the major drawbacks\n[7:26] about AWS CDK and the gsi ecosystem is\n[7:29] that you get a lot more capabilities\n[7:30] when you write in Typescript because you\n[7:33] can make libraries or reusable\n[7:35] components in Typescript and then you\n[7:37] can consume them in Python or Node. Oh\n[7:40] sorry in Python or Java or Golang or Net\n[7:42] so you can generate\n[7:43] >> but you can't make you can't go the\n[7:46] other way.\n[7:47] Yeah, because all that gsi does is it\n[7:50] just creates a binding uh from the other\n[7:53] languages that under the hood calls\n[7:55] JavaScript and you can't go the other\n[7:56] way. You can't create a binding from the\n[7:58] other languages back into TypeScript. So\n[8:00] like when I was evaluating it for like\n[8:02] teams to work with, one of the things\n[8:04] that we do with CDK AWS uh Terraform\n[8:06] CDK, what we do is we we're building\n[8:09] reusable components like L2s. like I I I\n[8:13] have a common L2 library, but then the\n[8:15] teams they're actually building type of\n[8:17] very customized L3s which are like very\n[8:20] focused on what they're trying to do and\n[8:22] they can do that in Typescript and then\n[8:25] we are publishing and consuming it and\n[8:27] transpiling it into uh Terapform\n[8:29] configuration so it lands straight into\n[8:31] our existing Terapform pipelines. So we\n[8:33] have all of our existing Atlantis, all\n[8:35] of our existing Terraform modules and\n[8:37] they just neatly land side by side with\n[8:39] no migration required. So if I\n[8:40] understand you correctly, Vincent, you\n[8:42] need to write your your shared\n[8:45] uh level two or three construct in in\n[8:48] Typescript for it to be shared.\n[8:52] >> Yes. Because like my whole my whole\n[8:55] pipeline is like you publish um an MPM\n[8:59] like code artifact private registry\n[9:00] package of your like I'm a product team,\n[9:02] right? I have my um service definition\n[9:06] which is an XJS or whatever uh or maybe\n[9:08] it's just an expressjs or yes we are\n[9:11] typescript shop sorry um and and then or\n[9:14] a lambdas right because actually it\n[9:16] applies much more to lambdas like let's\n[9:18] say that I am a product team and I have\n[9:19] a very serverless um solution that uses\n[9:22] SQS SNS um and all this like bucket\n[9:24] notifications and lambdas and all that\n[9:26] and and so I need to produce re reusable\n[9:29] artifact that I can then deploy in my\n[9:32] dev environ environment uh first you\n[9:34] know my sandbox evaluation environment\n[9:36] and then my staging environment with\n[9:37] more integration points with other um\n[9:39] you know existing uh staging resources\n[9:42] so I am producing a bundle uh an\n[9:45] artifact that is actually a library it's\n[9:48] an it's an IC little library and and the\n[9:52] integration\n[9:53] >> IC IC library what what's that mean\n[9:55] >> infrastructure as code library\n[9:57] >> oh okay sir\n[9:58] >> like a TF module is is kind of like a\n[10:00] bundle or library right except you um\n[10:03] you don't really have the capabilities\n[10:05] of defining strong interfaces and also\n[10:07] the library can't the module can't\n[10:08] really u modify itself depending on the\n[10:11] target environment right whereas if I am\n[10:14] um in in Typescript\n[10:16] >> the interfaces that I get are like\n[10:18] strongly typed and I have like I I can\n[10:21] even create imperative type of\n[10:24] reconfiguration like that the whole\n[10:26] thing can can adjust itself towards its\n[10:28] target and there's pros and cons right\n[10:30] because the more flexible the more you\n[10:32] get like um you know validation like\n[10:35] mechanisms now I need to I have like a\n[10:38] bigger interface right because I have\n[10:40] more ways I can be configured then more\n[10:42] things I need to test for the the the\n[10:44] different configuration\n[10:45] >> exposure\n[10:47] >> the\n[10:48] >> the other thing that was demoed to me\n[10:49] with the Palumi just getting back to the\n[10:51] Palumi thing was that\n[10:54] >> um yeah their SAS offering seemed pretty\n[10:57] robust you know they had secrets\n[10:58] management they had stack management\n[11:01] >> I mean I I I don't know if Terraform I\n[11:03] mean the last time I used Terraform\n[11:05] cloud or Terraform I don't know\n[11:06] workspaces or whatever it's called\n[11:08] nowadays\n[11:09] they feel I mean is IBM even supporting\n[11:12] it anymore because it doesn't seem to\n[11:14] change\n[11:15] >> this was always the biggest problem of\n[11:16] >> I don't get it like why why buy\n[11:18] Terraform if you're not going to\n[11:20] >> yeah I mean even the ter the cash cow\n[11:24] you know what I mean like\n[11:26] >> I don't get it\n[11:27] >> well IBM just been iterating on it\n[11:30] recently and Maybe part of deprecating\n[11:32] CDKTF is to ensure that they can focus\n[11:35] on other areas. Although that there was\n[11:37] a skeleton crew on CDKTF. I don't think\n[11:39] it actually took any of their headcount.\n[11:42] But it's a good thing they got rid of of\n[11:43] that that team. Not they got rid of the\n[11:44] team. They got rid of the product. Uh\n[11:46] the team is still there. The team moved\n[11:48] on. They work on more of the like core\n[11:50] features.\n[11:51] >> Yeah.\n[11:52] >> Yeah. But but go back to the Terraform\n[11:54] cloud uh and the Terraform enterprise.\n[11:57] One of the biggest issues with Hashior\n[11:58] Corp always and even Grab in Singapore\n[12:00] was leveraging Atlantis an open source\n[12:03] solution against Hashi Cororb saying\n[12:05] like look you're asking for this much\n[12:08] money and I can get like most of it out\n[12:10] of Atlantis in a more customizable way.\n[12:13] >> Yeah. So, so they did hire the guy um\n[12:17] you know Luke Kaslau and um the other\n[12:20] guy I forgot. Uh he's he's he's actually\n[12:22] head of product of of one component. um\n[12:25] Mikail he did I saw his presentation on\n[12:27] on Hashi Kate but but what I'm trying to\n[12:30] say is that they always lacked in in the\n[12:34] execution level of of the cloud solution\n[12:36] and Pulumi is very strong there you know\n[12:38] our by\n[12:38] >> yeah it's really good the I did ask them\n[12:41] that like so you have multiple stacks do\n[12:44] you have like a dependency tree and the\n[12:46] guy conceded that they didn't to my\n[12:48] surprise the outputs are strings\n[12:51] >> like what what what grid does you mean\n[12:54] something or or or what's it scon or\n[12:57] whatever you call it.\n[12:59] >> No, what I do with grit which is like\n[13:01] >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, you do grit but you\n[13:02] you were inspired by tacons or something\n[13:05] weren't you or something. I mean it's\n[13:07] terri ticons is my project. I was doing\n[13:09] grit. Tons I was inspired by open taco.\n[13:12] >> Open taco. That's that's the one. Yeah.\n[13:14] But like but yeah I I mean we talked\n[13:17] about it last podcast and I like\n[13:19] strongly typed shift left like we have\n[13:22] that now. What's the next thing? Better\n[13:25] dependency management with\n[13:26] infrastructure, right? I mean,\n[13:28] >> yes,\n[13:29] >> maybe.\n[13:30] >> But it's very hard because like\n[13:33] >> the argument that I hear the most from\n[13:35] Terra team and state graph is that this\n[13:37] is very hard to achieve with\n[13:38] infrastructure because you can't\n[13:40] validate that your network rules work\n[13:42] correct unless you actually deploy it\n[13:44] into that particular environment. And\n[13:47] there's always a difference because of\n[13:48] the side range differences and all. And\n[13:50] so that's kind of like where they they\n[13:52] say you can't fast your infrastructure.\n[13:53] It's not the same as software delivery.\n[13:56] And I can see that in a way. But I think\n[13:58] if you have a strong language and you\n[14:01] have like strong interfaces, you can do\n[14:03] a lot more you can get a lot more\n[14:05] confidence in in the fact that you know\n[14:07] it's going to work the way you expected.\n[14:08] >> Well, I think it's yeah problem yet to\n[14:10] be solved. At least I haven't seen it\n[14:12] solved. I mean I've\n[14:13] >> if you believe I should try your grid uh\n[14:17] your vibe code.\n[14:18] >> Yeah.\n[14:19] the grid is great. Um,\n[14:21] >> are you using it in production?\n[14:24] >> I guess your your your attention is has\n[14:26] been starved. You know, you're focusing\n[14:28] >> so I have not I mean I I I have it\n[14:30] deployed in a PC repo with the intention\n[14:32] of other people to validate it um in my\n[14:35] organization but we haven't been able to\n[14:38] promote it again because of like you\n[14:40] know\n[14:41] >> cost cutting exercises across the board\n[14:44] in every company that I talked to. I did\n[14:47] I didn't see the the flow in Palumi\n[14:49] actually. I was cuz it was like you know\n[14:52] didn't you didn't have a computer. We're\n[14:53] just talking face to face. The other but\n[14:56] the the demo that kind of blew me away\n[15:00] was not a plume\n[15:01] >> system initiative.\n[15:02] >> No no not the system initiative.\n[15:04] >> I can talk we can talk about that a\n[15:06] little bit later.\n[15:07] >> The demo that blew me away was the um so\n[15:11] so qlang is like pickle. you define your\n[15:14] config in a fancy fancy language.\n[15:17] >> You got to choose which one. You don't\n[15:19] know. You can't you can't\n[15:20] >> Well, I'm to be honest, I'm I'm leaning\n[15:22] towards Qang just because of some of\n[15:24] quality of life aspect. So, the cool\n[15:26] thing about Qang is like I don't know\n[15:28] that it changed the config, you know,\n[15:30] like scaled the memory, had more CPUs,\n[15:35] and then it and then of course it can\n[15:37] hook into pretty much anything. But they\n[15:40] showed a demo when it it did a terraform\n[15:42] plan. And the cool thing about that was\n[15:45] that when the Terraform plan came back,\n[15:49] it fed back into the Qang. So you could\n[15:52] so you could actually see the change\n[15:55] without like look, you know, like when\n[15:56] you do a plan, it's just like bloody\n[15:58] insane. And the cool thing about it, I\n[16:00] hope I'm trying to explain it correctly,\n[16:02] was that is that it summarized the plan\n[16:06] in a way that was like operationally\n[16:08] sane like yeah, you've changed this and\n[16:12] that's and and that's because of this\n[16:14] config change you and this plan cor like\n[16:17] works out how it is and then I I think\n[16:20] they've I'm not too sure if they\n[16:21] implemented it uh quite yet, but then\n[16:25] there's things in the works like the\n[16:26] approval gates and things like I mean\n[16:28] this This is something that we struggle\n[16:30] with at my workplace is like we're\n[16:32] changing Terraform like we have to\n[16:34] control how it's done the audited\n[16:36] whether it's deleted whether it's\n[16:38] updated replaced we have to we have to\n[16:40] understand what's going on because\n[16:42] reading plans is just or there is this\n[16:44] TF summarizer that we use but it's still\n[16:47] a nightmare. So the cool thing about\n[16:50] this was that it in the PR it like spun\n[16:52] up a Q lang thing. I didn't even know\n[16:54] you could do this and it was just really\n[16:57] fast and and nice. It was like\n[16:59] >> but this is a framework on Qang. This is\n[17:03] some like this is a bunch of tools that\n[17:04] they built on top of Qang.\n[17:06] >> Yeah, something like that. It's like a Q\n[17:07] lang. I think they call it Q hub.\n[17:10] >> Okay. I haven't heard about this.\n[17:12] >> That that demo was impressive. But then\n[17:15] and then some some other guy from\n[17:17] Ubisoft was giving a demo where I've\n[17:20] never quite seen this concept before but\n[17:22] he gave like I mean it was a bit\n[17:24] contrived but he gave the scenario where\n[17:27] he needs he's imagining like a thousand\n[17:30] users and then given a thousand users\n[17:33] then you can can say that given what the\n[17:36] application does you need you know a\n[17:38] thousand megabytes of RAM and then and\n[17:41] then um and then basically\n[17:44] this model of how your application works\n[17:46] becomes config and then also that model\n[17:51] gets confirmed in the observability. So\n[17:53] you have this sort of feedback loop\n[17:54] between what's deployed, what's being\n[17:57] observed, what's your model, what's\n[18:00] being deployed and you you go you go\n[18:03] from there. And then of course he uses Q\n[18:05] lang as a way of marking that all up so\n[18:08] that everything comes together and and\n[18:11] and further validates the model. I\n[18:14] thought that was I thought that was\n[18:15] really interesting. I've never I've\n[18:16] never seen it done that way before. But\n[18:19] like\n[18:19] >> that's interesting. But like my problem\n[18:22] with all of these custom like I\n[18:23] understand that a lot of organizations\n[18:25] like Google they even invented Qang\n[18:28] specifically to manage the problem of\n[18:29] configuration. um meaning that you don't\n[18:32] have a full-fledged programming language\n[18:34] for configuration management. That's why\n[18:36] they built Quolang. That's why Apple has\n[18:38] Pickle. Um\n[18:40] >> but I still I mean I think that's not\n[18:44] not a bad idea, right? Um the fact that\n[18:47] then you can use QAN to manage\n[18:48] configuration like the same reason why\n[18:50] JSONet exists, right? JSONet is a\n[18:52] language to basically, you know,\n[18:53] imperatively kind of control the JSON\n[18:55] configurations that you're trying to\n[18:56] generate.\n[18:57] >> Um but\n[19:01] My issue and I think I tried to tell\n[19:02] this to you as well when you send me\n[19:04] some of this this stuff is like great\n[19:07] you know that's yet another way of doing\n[19:10] the same thing on top of ter\n[19:13] resources. Yeah, you're inventing a new\n[19:16] thing. But the same way like with the\n[19:17] system initiative, you're just creating\n[19:19] another way of, you know, doing CRUD on\n[19:22] resources and that's not the problem,\n[19:24] right? Doing CRUD on resources.\n[19:28] >> Well, I wouldn't I mean that's a bit\n[19:30] unfair because I I mean I think Q is\n[19:33] trying to get that one pager that over\n[19:35] what that one pager of your of your\n[19:37] application system thing, right? Sorry,\n[19:40] I can't I'm not too sure. Sorry, I can\n[19:41] do I can do one page.\n[19:44] that with my hands\n[19:47] it's not trying to uh do CRUD operations\n[19:51] of course like the interesting thing I\n[19:53] was talking to some of the QAN guys like\n[19:56] you know\n[19:57] >> but you you delegate the problem you\n[19:59] delegate the CRUD to the to the to the\n[20:01] terraform provider right as long as you\n[20:03] don't as you leverageing providers you\n[20:05] get all of the\n[20:05] >> CR but in an ideal world things would\n[20:08] would great I mean this is the way I\n[20:10] understood what he was saying in an\n[20:11] ideal world things would vastly improve\n[20:14] if you could actually give that whole\n[20:16] config to the the cloud service provider\n[20:20] instead of doing all these CRUD\n[20:21] operations because there's so much\n[20:23] complexity in that Terraform provider.\n[20:25] There's so much stuff going on with all\n[20:27] those CRUD operations. In an ideal\n[20:29] world, you could just give the\n[20:31] declarative config and that's that I I\n[20:34] mean that's what we want to move\n[20:36] >> which is what kind of like Kubernetes\n[20:37] promises, right? You give it config\n[20:40] >> and that's what crossplane also\n[20:42] promises. You have to have a whole cloud\n[20:45] control layer like within Kubernetes. I\n[20:47] was chatting with a Kubernetes guy and I\n[20:49] mean we all know this stuff but like but\n[20:52] I just think it was I don't know maybe\n[20:53] it's just a gig that I'm on like he was\n[20:55] saying like yeah when you when you put\n[20:57] your CPUs and your memory definitions\n[21:00] and your deployment uh YAML the idea is\n[21:03] that you deploy it into your environment\n[21:05] and then you constantly refine it\n[21:08] knowing what the application\n[21:09] >> okay was that was that was that um is\n[21:11] that the guy okay I can guess who Daniel\n[21:14] was that Danielle\n[21:15] >> no it wasn't Daniel it was Okay,\n[21:17] >> it was another guy. But but I thought to\n[21:19] myself, it's like this is so weird\n[21:20] because or foreign to me because we have\n[21:23] so like in my workplace we have so many\n[21:25] environments\n[21:26] and there's a pro promotion environment\n[21:29] and like it's very very hard to nail\n[21:31] down the the resource limits. Anyway,\n[21:34] >> yeah. So I just thought there's this\n[21:36] cube learn uh from Daniel. They do some\n[21:38] really interesting like visualizations\n[21:40] of how Kubernetes worked. They even got\n[21:42] some gigs where they they trained Apple\n[21:44] uh engineers to on on communities. And\n[21:47] one of the recent things that he was\n[21:48] really into was to like how do you\n[21:50] evaluate the actual you know resource\n[21:53] requirements of your deployments and he\n[21:55] asked a lot of questions and spend a lot\n[21:57] of time trying to see because they added\n[21:59] now they added virtual pod autoscaling\n[22:02] as well. So before you could only like\n[22:04] add more pods, but now you can actually\n[22:06] with the control group V2, you can\n[22:08] actually resize the number of CPU and\n[22:10] memory you give a pot without recreating\n[22:13] the pot, which is insane, right? And and\n[22:15] and if you have those capabilities, then\n[22:17] you can like dynamically resize your CPU\n[22:20] and memory.\n[22:21] >> I still I still think it's pretty\n[22:24] insane in a way. I mean like\n[22:26] >> Yeah, but um I mean that's just one\n[22:30] application level. Hold on. Wait up.\n[22:32] Wait up. Wait up. Wait up. I just need\n[22:33] some water.\n[22:43] But these are all the dials and knobs\n[22:45] that you get with Kubernetes, right? And\n[22:47] the problem for me is YAML the way to\n[22:49] declaratively define it's insane. Then\n[22:52] you build languages on top like Q that\n[22:55] basically I I don't know do they use\n[22:56] because cuz doing a demo from what you\n[22:58] just said, right? He said Q is great if\n[23:02] only we could give it directly to the\n[23:04] provider uh directly to the cloud\n[23:05] service right and without having to go\n[23:07] through these providers with all their\n[23:09] legacy assumptions. And then we\n[23:12] discussed Kubernetes is a cloud\n[23:14] controller interface that gives you the\n[23:16] ability to declaratively define a very\n[23:18] you know\n[23:19] >> yeah I mean the guy behind Q is like the\n[23:22] the same guy behind uh Kubernetes\n[23:24] actually. So I guess that's why he says\n[23:27] stuff like that.\n[23:28] >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, if they built a\n[23:30] configuration front end that uses Qang\n[23:32] and then is able to manage the YAML um I\n[23:36] guess great but um that's still\n[23:41] I mean you still need a cluster to\n[23:43] deploy it and then yes maybe you can be\n[23:45] uh like like up upbound which is the\n[23:48] crossplane SAS um basically we provide\n[23:51] you the cluster so you don't have to run\n[23:52] your own clusters and then you just work\n[23:54] purely with crossplane so you just um\n[23:56] define all\n[23:57] >> no not crossplane Oh, getting\n[23:59] sidetracked here. Okay, let's\n[24:01] >> No, because you were talking about um\n[24:03] you know basically a control loop on top\n[24:06] of the cloud service and an uniform\n[24:08] control loop and that's what crossplane\n[24:09] is, right? They're a unifor uniform\n[24:11] control loop on top of the um\n[24:14] >> Yeah, but Kubernetes or something. I\n[24:17] mean, if you want to go\n[24:20] >> what are you talking about when you like\n[24:21] if you need to provision SQSQs and\n[24:23] topics and buckets?\n[24:24] >> Oh, okay. You want to still do AWS?\n[24:27] Okay. Yeah. Okay. I think I got you. I\n[24:29] got you. Yeah.\n[24:30] >> Not necessarily AWS. I mean, any cloud\n[24:32] that you're using, you're still using\n[24:33] managed services, right?\n[24:34] >> Uh oh, God. Sorry. Well, let let's let's\n[24:38] go back to AI. Did Did you Did you Did\n[24:41] you see\n[24:42] >> because that was part of your prompt\n[24:43] like\n[24:44] >> did you see Adam did you see Adam Jacobs\n[24:46] talk? Did I did I share it with you?\n[24:48] >> Uh is are they online? I don't know why\n[24:50] I didn't.\n[24:51] >> Yeah, it's online. Yeah, it was it was\n[24:54] good.\n[24:55] >> Okay, that's good. Yeah. No, but like\n[24:56] you give me some notes where you you\n[24:58] said like um it's going to be so much\n[25:00] code that we cannot control it and our\n[25:02] role is more towards validation. I mean\n[25:04] I've hear the same thing for\n[25:06] >> spot checking\n[25:07] >> everyone I talk to.\n[25:08] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[25:09] >> I think those are like Yeah. If you use\n[25:10] the AI you kind of like you got to be\n[25:13] blind if you don't see that.\n[25:15] >> Yeah.\n[25:16] >> I think everyone's coming to this\n[25:17] conclusion.\n[25:18] >> Yeah. the I you know what one thing I've\n[25:21] always found very polarizing in my\n[25:23] career is sllock like source lines of\n[25:25] code and he basically just came up guns\n[25:29] firing saying that like that with AI you\n[25:32] can output 50k lines of code and he I\n[25:35] the point he was trying to make is that\n[25:37] like the force multiplier the utility\n[25:40] the uh the what AI can do is absolutely\n[25:45] insane\n[25:47] and um I I mean 50k I mean what what is\n[25:50] 50k? It means nothing. It just but it\n[25:51] means it's just it's just a number.\n[25:53] >> I mean people just refer to that like\n[25:56] >> huh\n[25:57] >> Boris when he talks about all of the\n[25:59] code to plot code he he just says like\n[26:02] 500 PRs a week or something. It's all\n[26:05] managed different.\n[26:06] >> So yeah, he was he was talking about the\n[26:08] velocity. The velocity Yeah. My take\n[26:11] away from his talk was that the velocity\n[26:13] is now absolutely bananas\n[26:16] and now the bottleneck is\n[26:18] infrastructures code because because\n[26:21] because all that velocity needs to run\n[26:24] on some service. So we need to match\n[26:28] that velocity with the way that we\n[26:30] provide infrastructure as code. So yeah,\n[26:32] it had me thinking like what is slow in\n[26:34] my organization like oh my god you know\n[26:37] PRs are slow um our CDK stack\n[26:41] deployments and everything like that the\n[26:43] coordination and the releases is slow\n[26:46] the promotion is slow\n[26:49] >> there's so much slow slowness in at\n[26:51] least\n[26:52] in my in my workplace I find um for\n[26:55] different re not not just technological\n[26:57] reasons I would say mostly\n[26:59] organizational and approval\n[27:02] reasons everything is so slow in my in\n[27:05] my client.\n[27:07] >> Mhm. So yeah, it got me thinking and\n[27:09] this is why I was asking questions like\n[27:11] like\n[27:12] now I'm now I'm looking at my\n[27:14] infrastructures code pipeline and just\n[27:16] thinking like like how can I make this\n[27:18] fast\n[27:20] so that um so I mean like I don't when\n[27:25] you develop with AI are you doing a\n[27:28] Terraform plan and apply or or CDK\n[27:31] deploy and apply and and like don't you\n[27:33] feel that that's a bit slow or maybe\n[27:34] we're we're looking at the Oh\n[27:37] >> no, because one of the things that you\n[27:39] highlighted in that Golang architecture\n[27:41] for AWS or that that cloud gave you was\n[27:44] like deployment time with AWS CDK is\n[27:47] fast just CDK deploy. I think that's one\n[27:50] of the main criticisms I hear about CDK\n[27:52] is that you know cloud formation is so\n[27:54] extremely slow. Um you know because it\n[27:57] goes and and it gives you this\n[27:59] transactional uh guarantees like it's\n[28:02] all or nothing. So it starts to deploy,\n[28:04] it starts to create backups, it try\n[28:06] starts to do all of this additional\n[28:07] stuff and then if anything goes wrong,\n[28:10] it does guarantee the full roll back\n[28:12] which is super frustrating\n[28:14] >> which never seems\n[28:15] >> super frustrating work because then you\n[28:17] have something left behind then\n[28:18] something you know prevents it from\n[28:20] being destroyed and and it doesn't work\n[28:22] right. Um\n[28:24] >> but\n[28:25] >> but that's the thing that you don't get\n[28:26] with terraform right when you run a fly\n[28:29] um if it doesn't go through totally it\n[28:30] just left like that right and then\n[28:32] you're left to to figure it out it goes\n[28:34] very fast right it going to create\n[28:36] destroy everything and then it go like\n[28:38] whoop uh actually we're stuck good luck\n[28:41] and there's no guarantee on on the roll\n[28:42] back right which is what you don't get\n[28:44] uh with terafform it does make\n[28:46] everything feel much faster because you\n[28:48] have these individual resources all\n[28:49] getting created super fast but you're\n[28:51] then you don't have the transactional\n[28:52] guant guarantee right so that was one of\n[28:54] the things that I was trying to solve\n[28:55] with my friend when we were uh because\n[28:57] he heavily relied on this cloud\n[28:59] formation guarantee uh doing cross\n[29:02] regional deploys because that's another\n[29:03] great thing about cloud formation it's\n[29:05] basically available in every region so\n[29:06] you want to do a cross regional deploy\n[29:08] just kick it off and it goes um but then\n[29:11] when we looking at like moving over to\n[29:13] Terraform we we are like oh [ __ ] now we\n[29:15] are responsible because we're like like\n[29:17] the fly.io IO right now we are\n[29:19] responsible for like what if the\n[29:21] deployment failed how do we roll back\n[29:23] and I'm like yeah I can't tell you you\n[29:25] know could be so many reasons why ter I\n[29:27] just had the thought that um I made a\n[29:30] video about this a month ago or two I\n[29:32] just had the thought that like\n[29:36] data aside what probably works best for\n[29:39] AI is just having its own AWS account\n[29:42] which it just bootstraps from from\n[29:44] scratch and when that AWS account\n[29:47] becomes comes crofty. It just basically\n[29:50] deletes it AWS account.\n[29:51] >> Nukes it.\n[29:52] >> Nukes it and starts a new one. What is\n[29:54] that? There's probably a name for it.\n[29:55] It's uh I don't know like\n[29:58] >> ephemeral.\n[29:59] >> Pardon?\n[30:00] >> Sounds ephemeral.\n[30:01] >> Yeah. Yeah. Ephemeral. Yeah. I think AI\n[30:04] needs more ephemeral environments. Oh,\n[30:07] but in my current workplace, just\n[30:08] getting an account vended is really\n[30:10] really really really hard. No. And I I\n[30:13] don't know how we can even close it. But\n[30:15] yeah, a firmware environment surely\n[30:17] seems like an an AI friendly pattern.\n[30:20] >> Well, everything has data. You know, the\n[30:22] biggest problem with environments is\n[30:23] data. You know, how do you like even\n[30:26] replicate or even when I want to do a\n[30:28] full integration test with with full QA\n[30:30] automation end to end? How do I get\n[30:32] realistic data? Do I have seats for\n[30:34] everything? Do I replicate production\n[30:36] data? Do I, you know, mask out all of\n[30:39] the information like some\n[30:42] question. Yeah, I don't think anyone\n[30:43] really talked about data and AI, but\n[30:45] that was probably the missing piece of\n[30:48] the puzzle for me.\n[30:50] >> Another we have a job. If this was all\n[30:53] solved, we wouldn't have a job,\n[30:55] >> I suppose. God, you sound really\n[30:57] Belgian. Um, maybe it's all the Flemish\n[31:00] I'm hearing. I one other demo before\n[31:04] before I need to probably run out\n[31:05] screaming is um which I found really\n[31:08] interesting and that really proves the\n[31:10] cat is out the bag was this guy was\n[31:12] showing that his new framework laptop\n[31:14] with the AI Max chipset and\n[31:17] interestingly he had like he had like I\n[31:20] don't know\n[31:21] >> open clocks\n[31:22] >> he had 180i he had 128 gigs of RAM or\n[31:26] something and the cool thing he said is\n[31:28] that this new AMD Mac AI max one the\n[31:32] USPS. One of the key features is that\n[31:33] you can dedicate your RAM to the GPU and\n[31:37] make your GPU even more powerful.\n[31:39] >> So he basically KVMED into his machine\n[31:44] which didn't have any internet. And then\n[31:46] he he's also the author of era which is\n[31:49] like this uh anible playbook um sort of\n[31:54] UI where it like logs how long the AI\n[31:57] playbook took to run and what the inputs\n[32:00] were and and what the logs were. So\n[32:02] basically he managed to configure his\n[32:04] his framework desktop to diagnose\n[32:07] failing playbooks\n[32:09] and he was just using you know Alama and\n[32:12] uh I don't know the GP GPT\n[32:15] whatever or the Z or what I don't\n[32:18] whatever local models\n[32:21] >> GM\n[32:21] >> and it was just ch it was just steaming\n[32:24] through all these playbook errors and\n[32:26] fixing things you know missing updating\n[32:28] >> local models nice\n[32:29] >> yeah updating Postgress libraries,\n[32:33] fixing errors.\n[32:34] >> It wasn't a prepared demo at all.\n[32:36] >> Huh?\n[32:36] >> It was probably Postgress from 5 years\n[32:38] ago. Well, within the training database\n[32:40] of the of the local maybe, maybe.\n[32:43] >> Just kidding. I'm just kidding.\n[32:44] >> But the the demo was compelling because\n[32:46] u you know how it is. It's like or you\n[32:49] don't want to use AI because it's you\n[32:53] know uh it's only used to be become\n[32:56] dependent on anthropic and open AI. But\n[32:59] no, hell no. This shows that we have the\n[33:03] ability to run it locally. Of course,\n[33:06] the model the model is not as capable as\n[33:08] claude, but it's damn well the cat is\n[33:11] >> but think about it.\n[33:12] >> Those local models now are like 04\n[33:15] capabilities and 04 like chain of think\n[33:18] of of of thinking.\n[33:20] >> Why you say 04? I mean, okay, whatever.\n[33:22] because they they they do compare like\n[33:24] the the uh GPT OSS are equal to 04 is\n[33:28] GPT04 like the the first\n[33:30] >> reason I think 34 I mean the whole\n[33:32] bloody versioning thing doesn't really\n[33:34] make sense but like\n[33:35] >> yeah it was 01 04 because they went GPT3\n[33:39] GPT4 then 01 then 04\n[33:42] >> even even six month or one year old\n[33:44] models at this point are actually pretty\n[33:46] capable for some for some tasks\n[33:49] >> so yeah like so like Of course, anyone\n[33:53] that's listening to us right now, I\n[33:55] would say that like the best model at\n[33:58] the moment is the Claude Anthropic 4.5\n[34:01] Opus or or SA. It's\n[34:03] >> So, you just got a sponsorship, is it?\n[34:05] >> No, this is # notsponsored. It's It's\n[34:08] like It's $20 a month to get on pro. Of\n[34:11] course, you get limited quite heavily if\n[34:13] you do anything hardcore, but like like\n[34:16] guys, the sun is shining. The sun is\n[34:18] shining. Make hay.\n[34:21] >> Wait, you're in uh in Belgium and the\n[34:23] sun is shining. I can imagine you're\n[34:24] happy.\n[34:25] >> I think there's something something\n[34:27] going weird. Is Is the AI Did the AI do\n[34:31] this? Is the AI listening?\n[34:33] >> So, there's this that happened. Um\n[34:38] Oh [ __ ] Is there sensitive information\n[34:41] here? Probably just\n[34:43] >> your your locations maybe. Hmc.\n[34:46] >> Um what is this? Oh,\n[34:51] you now you you're now a big boy wearing\n[34:53] big boy pants.\n[34:54] >> Just up just upgraded this morning. I\n[34:57] felt like I'm\n[34:57] >> Have you Have you already hit the limits\n[34:59] knowing you?\n[35:00] >> No, no, no, no, no, no. I was I was\n[35:02] running out of limits on pro every week\n[35:03] like within 3 days and I was like that's\n[35:05] it. I need I need for the next few weeks\n[35:08] I have quite a lot of things to I have\n[35:09] to do and I need\n[35:11] >> I'd be curious if you hit the limits cuz\n[35:13] it's like it's that classic isn't it?\n[35:14] It's like you get the back now. Now\n[35:16] you're over overprovisioned and now\n[35:18] you're like thinking, \"Oh, I'm not using\n[35:20] it enough.\"\n[35:22] >> Yeah, I know. This is definitely going\n[35:23] to lead to some burnout.\n[35:26] So, yeah, I'm um I'm probably going to\n[35:28] you're probably going to have to cut\n[35:30] some vision like put some black boxes\n[35:33] some places because I just showed part\n[35:34] of my credit card. I don't know if that\n[35:36] was going to help you with the last four\n[35:38] digits of your credit card.\n[35:40] >> Yeah, it's true. And it's also there's\n[35:41] no money on it.\n[35:43] But that's not how credit cards work.\n[35:47] >> Max plan. I can just imagine like people\n[35:50] panhandling on the streets.\n[35:52] >> I need money for my max pan.\n[35:56] >> Hey, you're kidding. But I do think that\n[35:58] that's what's going to happen next.\n[35:59] >> No, no, no. I mean, I was just going to\n[36:01] become elite.\n[36:03] >> What?\n[36:03] >> It's going to become only accessible to\n[36:05] some people.\n[36:07] Well, when you talk about panhandling, I\n[36:09] I I really think some people are not\n[36:11] going to get access anymore.\n[36:13] >> Come on. My earlier story was supposed\n[36:15] to point out that for for four grand,\n[36:18] you can basically get a less capable\n[36:20] model, but run it locally.\n[36:23] >> For four grand of hardware,\n[36:25] >> that's only four grand he spent.\n[36:27] >> Yeah, the framework laptop is 4,000\n[36:29] Canadian or something.\n[36:31] >> Okay. Okay, that's not too bad. So, you\n[36:33] could argue that, you know, with the\n[36:34] money I spend every month, I could have\n[36:36] just bought and depreciated it. I still\n[36:39] don't think it's the same, though. Um,\n[36:41] >> yeah, it's difficult like, yeah,\n[36:44] >> you know what? What convinced me to to\n[36:45] bump it up? Not just that I was hitting\n[36:47] the limits on Pro, but also that the\n[36:49] recent cloud code announcements. So,\n[36:52] they added um like task dependencies.\n[36:54] So, you basically have beats built into\n[36:56] cloud code, right? The ability\n[36:57] >> Oh, that's all that's all in cloud code\n[36:59] right now. Yeah. Like since I've been\n[37:01] since I've been in a conference for a\n[37:02] week, I feel like I missed a month's\n[37:04] worth of announcements.\n[37:06] >> What did I miss?\n[37:07] >> So So I I should share with you the\n[37:09] video from the guy who used to do\n[37:11] speckit at Microsoft and he now he's now\n[37:13] anthropic, right? Dan I forgot his last\n[37:15] name, Dan de Demen something. Um and he\n[37:19] just broke down the future of cloud\n[37:22] code, right? He he's he's obviously very\n[37:24] experienced with like he highlights some\n[37:26] of the techniques that you use and they\n[37:28] are very very heavily used in in speckit\n[37:30] which is um the templating um so\n[37:33] basically you give the model a template\n[37:36] of what a plan looks like right and and\n[37:38] speckit does that when you run the\n[37:40] command it executes a script and that\n[37:42] script prepares it template in the right\n[37:44] place and then it tells the model read\n[37:46] it these are the things you need to do\n[37:47] and it follows a template right so you\n[37:49] get very consistent\n[37:50] >> why do you call it a template I mean\n[37:51] that could be a skill couldn't Yeah. I\n[37:53] mean, why do you\n[37:54] >> what's the difference between a template\n[37:55] and a skill?\n[37:56] >> It's a combination because like now\n[37:57] skill and commands, they're very\n[37:59] similar. You can like invoke skills the\n[38:00] same way that you can invoke commands.\n[38:02] So, what used to be a command has been\n[38:04] renamed to skills. So, skills and he\n[38:06] calls it the templates approach because\n[38:08] on one side you have a skill that gives\n[38:09] you instructions of the steps to follow,\n[38:11] but on the other side you have a\n[38:12] template of the actual artifact that you\n[38:14] want to produce. If you're talking\n[38:15] specifically about plans and and tasks\n[38:18] and execution of what your agents are\n[38:20] going to do, you need to have a certain\n[38:22] um you know level of information within\n[38:24] these specifications that the agents can\n[38:26] do it correctly without um confusion.\n[38:29] Right? So the the biggest issue is um if\n[38:32] you do VIPE coding, you are missing\n[38:34] intent and you're missing some of the\n[38:37] like you're you're letting the model\n[38:38] make assumptions and you're leaving some\n[38:40] of the edge cases out without your\n[38:42] decision and that leads to unexpected\n[38:44] results. So when you are following this\n[38:47] template model, you are capturing those\n[38:49] requirements and you are eliminating\n[38:51] those assumptions and those um blurry\n[38:54] lines. So so that's part of the spec\n[38:56] kit. Uh and\n[38:57] >> I guess the template implies that things\n[38:59] need to be captured perhaps.\n[39:01] >> Yes, the template has your minimum\n[39:02] requirements and he doesn't do only the\n[39:04] template because he also adds on top\n[39:06] that you have the hook validation hook.\n[39:08] So when the agent walked worked through\n[39:11] the template and captured all of the\n[39:12] information according to the template\n[39:14] and the task and the user specification\n[39:17] then there's a validation hook like he\n[39:18] uses actually um the one that you\n[39:20] mentioned like the the Astra TY the type\n[39:23] thing. He actually validates that the\n[39:26] the template has the attributes um\n[39:28] deterministically like this particular\n[39:30] specification documents or requirements\n[39:32] documents has this section this section\n[39:35] this section are all valid it doesn't\n[39:38] you know validate the contents but it\n[39:39] validates the section exists uh and\n[39:42] that's also what ko does right when you\n[39:43] are you know building your your your\n[39:45] plan to to to feed it to agents to\n[39:48] execute because ko is all about the\n[39:50] upfront planning everyone that uses AI\n[39:52] lately they all say you spend 80% time\n[39:55] up front planning 20% of the time is is\n[39:58] the agent executing right that that\n[40:00] execution load like what what Adam just\n[40:02] said as well it's just generated just\n[40:04] goes on right and your job as a human\n[40:07] with your limited amount of effective\n[40:09] hours and attention span you are um in\n[40:12] in in charge of like making the critical\n[40:14] decisions\n[40:15] >> Adam Adam was saying that we all need to\n[40:17] read the u the domain driven design book\n[40:21] which I think is written by like um a\n[40:23] thought worker um 100% or ex thought\n[40:26] worker. I mean have you have you ever\n[40:28] actually dived into domain uh driven\n[40:31] design yourself?\n[40:32] >> Yeah there so many times I've wanted to\n[40:35] and I've never really spent a lot of\n[40:37] time on it. So like anyway with with all\n[40:39] the specit stuff we I mean you missed\n[40:41] the specit to me did you find the stuff\n[40:44] any improving I guess it's just more and\n[40:47] more integrated with clawed code right\n[40:49] it's nothing\n[40:50] >> yeah so the guy who built who who wrote\n[40:52] large parts of specket and you know\n[40:53] iterated through a lot of the prompts\n[40:55] and set this all up aside from the idea\n[40:57] he worked with someone at Microsoft that\n[40:58] came up like that that that lead led\n[41:01] with the idea he's the guy that actually\n[41:02] built the specket now at Mantropic he's\n[41:05] introducing a lot of these\n[41:07] features on top of the cloud code suite.\n[41:10] So if you watch his video, it's not on\n[41:12] his um official channel like he has a\n[41:14] separate channel which is like um how\n[41:16] you call like indie dan. Yeah, that's\n[41:18] his because like independent it's it's\n[41:20] like\n[41:20] >> oh\n[41:21] >> and yeah and there he actually goes down\n[41:23] he talks about the validation hooks he\n[41:25] talks about the template uh approach and\n[41:28] then he talks about my god\n[41:30] >> yes and then he talks about the agent\n[41:32] system because you were able to do\n[41:34] agents but the the co coordination\n[41:36] system was bad right I told you I tried\n[41:38] I I had all of my plans worked out I had\n[41:41] identified parallel tasks perfect for\n[41:44] parallel agents right because there's no\n[41:45] way that these agents will step on each\n[41:47] other's toes if they're completely\n[41:49] working on separate parallel tasks.\n[41:51] Wrong. Cuz there was assumptions in\n[41:53] there in in the in the tasks in the\n[41:54] context that they got which was like\n[41:56] there's this shared library and each one\n[41:58] of them implemented the shared library\n[42:00] and things like that. Um so that\n[42:02] requires coordination between agents uh\n[42:04] and and like Gasttown and others they\n[42:06] use agent mail and more traditional\n[42:07] systems of like agents messaging each\n[42:09] other and I think they're building\n[42:10] Gasttown now directly into cloud code.\n[42:13] So that's why I upgraded because I felt\n[42:15] like Opus is not going to like my my my\n[42:17] basic access to Opus is not going to cut\n[42:19] it.\n[42:19] >> Okay. There's a there's a lot going on\n[42:21] here. So do you still use beads is what\n[42:23] is was at the top of my mind?\n[42:26] >> At the moment I am uh because what I'm\n[42:28] working with is something cloud code\n[42:30] independent but I also feel that I\n[42:34] upgraded because I wanted to see what\n[42:36] this is going to be. you know this thing\n[42:37] that then uh showcased where he\n[42:40] highlighted some of the core concepts\n[42:41] that I see in in specket reapplied into\n[42:44] cloud code and the concept of agent\n[42:46] swarm directly in cloud code I felt that\n[42:50] um I don't know if I will be using beats\n[42:52] in that scenario right uh I talked to\n[42:55] other people they they use GitHub issues\n[42:57] and other stuff like that um\n[42:59] >> so does this t I mean have you played\n[43:01] with this crawl code or has it just been\n[43:02] announced is it live like does it save\n[43:05] the tasks to to some to some database or\n[43:09] to some\n[43:09] >> it has its task like it has it memory\n[43:12] system so it has the ability to save\n[43:14] task across sessions that's one of the\n[43:16] features of this new task system\n[43:17] >> because it is it able to do what beads\n[43:18] does like you know\n[43:20] >> it has dependency it has the ability to\n[43:22] define this task locks test task and\n[43:24] things like that\n[43:25] >> yeah it they build all of that into\n[43:27] cloud code now so if you if you consider\n[43:29] all of that the reason to use beats\n[43:32] becomes a loss less if you are go full\n[43:34] in onto cloud code So that's kind of\n[43:36] like where I'm I'm I'm feeling out.\n[43:38] That's why I want to explore\n[43:39] >> because I remember talking to you and\n[43:40] you were like getting uh Gemini to\n[43:43] review the output from claw code. Those\n[43:46] sort of workflows are going to I guess\n[43:47] become harder and harder to do if you go\n[43:50] all in, right?\n[43:52] >> One of the thing the points that Theo\n[43:54] made about the move from Entropic to not\n[43:56] allow people to use their subscription\n[43:58] outside of cloud code and and\n[44:00] effectively shut down anyone that does\n[44:02] and ban their accounts. um is because\n[44:04] they want to make it very sticky, right?\n[44:06] They not the model alone is not the and\n[44:08] I think we know Opus by itself is just\n[44:10] on par with the toolkit that they want\n[44:15] you to stick to. So that's why they are\n[44:17] like building the toolkit.\n[44:19] >> Yeah, it seems sad though and\n[44:23] >> yeah, it would be very like I also I\n[44:25] always said like I keep my options open.\n[44:27] I don't go following full in on any of\n[44:28] them. But with the recent evolution and\n[44:32] the way that Antropic is leading and I\n[44:33] also think like I think KO is actually\n[44:36] because AWS has invested into Antropic I\n[44:39] don't know how Kir is affected by this\n[44:41] um you know this this decision of how\n[44:43] you get to use the model but KO uses\n[44:46] entropic models right um so I think Kiru\n[44:49] might have an edge there but I still\n[44:51] feel you know I still feel cloud code is\n[44:54] like ahead even though that most people\n[44:57] hate the leadership of Antropic\n[44:59] with with all of his, you know, like\n[45:01] even even\n[45:03] >> Well, it's a bit anti-competitive, but I\n[45:06] guess they're trying to build they're\n[45:07] trying to build a moat. Trying to build\n[45:09] a moat.\n[45:10] >> Yeah. And they're like, you know, don't\n[45:12] sell GPU to China. That's an like and\n[45:15] all that. Like they're very vocal about\n[45:18] those things. And\n[45:19] >> what about other announcements? I mean,\n[45:21] I I mean, I can't help but think be a\n[45:25] >> Yeah, I'm being a shenan friend to open\n[45:26] AI. They don't seem to do anything that\n[45:28] seems to capture my attention lately.\n[45:30] >> Yeah. So, I shared with a friend that I\n[45:32] just went in on on Max and he's like,\n[45:33] \"What are you doing?\" Because OpenAI\n[45:35] just uh you know, double.\n[45:37] >> Yeah.\n[45:38] >> Yeah. They just released this new UI and\n[45:40] and and Tio did like a very nice uh\n[45:43] breakdown um comparing it. Uh like I I\n[45:47] used to complain a lot about Teio, but I\n[45:49] think I I\n[45:50] >> Did he did he do an honest thing and say\n[45:52] this is junk and open AI and Claude is\n[45:55] >> No. Yeah, he he had to he had to frame\n[45:57] his video very heavily with like I am\n[45:59] not being paid by OpenAI blah blah blah\n[46:01] blah blah but Codex is amazing.\n[46:04] >> Um so it was interesting to see he\n[46:06] basically said they took all of the good\n[46:08] stuff of anti-gravity which is the agent\n[46:10] management and they made it accessible\n[46:12] in codeex so that you can run multiple\n[46:13] agents across work trees. They made the\n[46:15] ability to use work trees more intuitive\n[46:17] so you can see all of the work trees\n[46:19] that exist and switch between them very\n[46:21] easily.\n[46:21] >> Have you tried Have you tried it\n[46:22] yourself?\n[46:23] >> No, I only watched\n[46:26] It looked like a very It looked like a\n[46:27] co-work ripoff on the face of it. I\n[46:30] mean, it looked\n[46:31] >> okay. I haven't tried co-work.\n[46:32] >> It just looked like another like fat\n[46:34] electron app. It looked very uninspiring\n[46:36] to me.\n[46:37] >> Okay. So, a lot of like So, somebody\n[46:39] told me like, \"Hey, Open AI just doubled\n[46:41] the usage limits because I was like, but\n[46:43] when I I went from Pro, I went to max,\n[46:45] which is five times my usage limit, but\n[46:47] of course at um three times the cost. Um\n[46:50] but um Oh, no. Is it It is actually\n[46:54] five. Wait,\n[46:55] >> it said five I think it said 5x on your\n[46:57] earlier share.\n[46:59] >> Yeah, it says 5x usage, but the cost is\n[47:01] also not triple. I think it's also more\n[47:03] than anyway doesn't matter.\n[47:05] >> 5x decision\n[47:07] productivity.\n[47:08] >> It's like no buyers remorse here.\n[47:12] >> No buyers remorse here. No impulse\n[47:15] decision.\n[47:18] >> And\n[47:18] >> okay, cool. I have to go also.\n[47:20] >> Okay, you have to go. But like talking\n[47:22] speaking of buyers remorse, I I did find\n[47:24] it very interesting. A colleague said to\n[47:26] me that like Claude is basically making\n[47:28] you feel like you're at a gambling\n[47:30] machine. It make it's making it\n[47:32] addictive to do the thing. And I think\n[47:35] you might be addicted, Vincent. You\n[47:37] might be hooked by\n[47:38] >> is this an intervention? If the next\n[47:40] call I join and there's five people on\n[47:41] the call, I'm going and my wife\n[47:43] >> when says it was a great idea. Maybe it\n[47:46] wasn't Vincent. That's all I'm saying.\n[47:48] When you when you started saying using\n[47:50] cloud is like a gambling machine, my\n[47:51] initial reaction was this guy never\n[47:53] heard of specit. This guy doesn't know\n[47:55] how to how to you know get the quality\n[47:58] control if he cannot control.\n[48:01] >> Oh okay. No no I mean it is very\n[48:03] addictive this whole stuff. Okay. See\n[48:05] you. Thanks for the chat. I'll publish\n[48:08] this sometime.\n[48:09] >> Enjoy K. Enjoy the sunshine.\n[48:11] >> Thank you. Bye.",

Do not mention or acknowledge them, and do not say you skipped or ignored anything. Avoid sponsor/ad/promo language, brand names like Squarespace, or CTA phrases like discount code. Treat them as if they do not exist. If a slide segment is purely sponsor/ad content, leave that slide marker with no text.\nWrite a detailed summary that captures the main points, supporting facts, and concrete numbers or quotes when present.\nUse the slide format below. Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 61,333 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line. Use straight quotation marks (no curly) as needed. If no suitable line exists, omit excerpts.

Where are you?\n>> Can you recognize?\n>> That looks like a ugly city.\n>> Sure is.\n>> Yeah. I I miss Kent.\n>> Yeah, it's actually it's pretty good. I\njust I just been enjoying walking around\nactually. It's been fun. And the\narchitecture is pretty amazing. Like I'm\nconfused cuz I I always thought to\nmyself that like\nI don't know that that um\nthat Europe is\ndying.\n>> Well, yeah. Exactly. But like the\nbuildings there are quite wellmaintained\nand rich. You know what I mean? It's\nlike confused.\n>> If you believe certain politicians, it's\nall you know run over by crime. And\n>> maybe maybe that's still the case.\n>> Yeah. And there's a lot of like um you\nknow young beautiful people walking\naround and uh\nYeah. It's quite it's quite different to\nLondon. I'd say\n>> cuz I'm old now. See why hair cannot be\nthere anymore.\n>> I'm I'm freaking Gandalf right now, man.\n>> Yeah. So yeah, Belgian's been great and\nyeah, the conflict management camp was\ngood. I mean, I think it's actually the\nbest infrastructure conference on the\nplanet, I dare say.\n>> Is it now?\n>> And you missed out on\n>> Yeah, I did uh fortunately um after some\ninformation around holiday period, I had\nto\n>> lock in some uh contracts and deals and\nit's been going great. So,\nunfortunately, I couldn't make it to\nconfig management camp, but I was able\nto do different things.\n>> So, this is all CDK ter was it CD? what\ndo you call your your\n>> DDK terrain it's called now hey actually\nyour your your proposal of the Golang um\nsetup of a project and hosting on AWS\nwhere on one side you evaluate cloud\nform versus the AWS CLI and AWS CDK uh\nbut you're not evaluating Terraform in\nthere um you're comparing it against\ncloud for\n>> well that that plan that I sent you like\nI\n>> I I thought I wouldn't influence it that\nmuch but I asked Claude\n>> to give me what it wants to do.\n>> And funny enough, it didn't mention\nTerraform. Like I was I started the\nprompt saying like\n>> that's interesting.\n>> Like what how would you\num and I I think I I should have shared\nthe prompt, shouldn't I? I think I was\nopt I was optimizing for speed and\noperational simplicity\nand that's what and and CDK came up top.\nSo yeah.\n>> Yeah. But like\n>> even if you look at the data of that\nlike um report that was shared by Matt\nGawi um but it's it's AWS usage data\nreport about how people deploy on top of\nAWS. Cloud formation was by far the the\nhighest used and then there was\nTerraform right after and then there was\nAWS CDK. You know, I I I find it funny\nthat you don't combine AWS CDK and cloud\nfor because it's the same, right? It's\ncloud form. Uh except you have a better\ninterface when you use AWS CDK.\n>> Well, I mean, not you like the the\npeople that that support.\n>> Yeah. The I guess the winner for CDK is\nthe is the you know the shift left early\nfeedback because at at compile time\nyou should kind of know if if your code\nis working, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I mean and I think that\n>> not 100% but like good enough.\n>> You you I you you must have influenced\ncloud to consider this as one of the\ncriteria fact of the compile time\nchecking or it's influenced by your\nprevious discussions.\n>> Maybe maybe maybe\n>> so I had a chat with the Palumi guys\nat the desk at config management camp\nyesterday. I was pretty impressed with\nwhat they\n>> they're doing really cool stuff. Yeah.\nNo, no. I have to say like if you\nconsider CDKTF and Pulumi as as like\ncompetitors, I don't think that's true\nbecause I I mean I was naive. I I did\noriginally consider them. Uh but then\nsomebody showed you know wisen me up and\nand showed me some of the really cool\nstuff because Pulumi is a host engine\nthat allows your um your infrastructure\ncode to hook into some really advanced\nfeatures that you can't do with\nTerraform declarative configuration or\nyou can't do even with CDKTF unless you\nhave some type of like the the runtime\nthe host environment in which your your\nTypeScript or Python or Golang you know\nthe host is is giving the\ninfrastructures code a lot of like\ndynamic capabilities of lookup and AWS\nCDK does some of that because you you do\nhave the CLI able to host\n>> what do you mean the host like the their\nSAS application what do you mean by host\n>> no no no like the puli host so when you\nrun the when you run your infrastructure\nconfiguration application it's an\napplication right when you run it in\npuli it runs inside a host that runs\nyour\n>> like the kubernetes model like desired\nstate is it why is it like that?\n>> Uh no it's like you know because\nultimately puli uses the terapform\nproviders so under the hood at least\noriginally. So, so what what it does\ngive the program, you know, because your\nTerraform, sorry, your TypeScript is a\nprogram that executes, right? And it\nexposes some functionality to that\nprogram that you write that can do\nthings like\ncustom or tailor make tailor my\nTerraform or my my provider resource\nconfiguration to the target. So it does\nlike it it's called environment agnostic\nor um environment aware setups. If you\ngive it information about the target\nenvironment, it can actually uh provide\num details. Oh, sorry. Uh I just have to\nreply to someone.\n>> So so that that it does it does that's\nthe power of puli to me. um that you're\n>> the the question in my mind when I\napproached the Palumi desk was like I\nguess I was coming from an AI\nuh perspective in the sense that like\nsince Palumi offers different language\nbindings and of course it does straight\nup YAML what would be the best language\nfor\nuh AI to use given all those choices and\nthe guy interestingly said like it\ndoesn't matter it doesn't matter it\ndoesn't matter\nwhich I thought was quite curious\n>> he said it doesn't matter like what is\nthe best language to like the front end\nthe the interface that you use to define\nyour infrastructure\n>> yeah like he said he was basically\nimplying that it wasn't it didn't matter\nif it was go yaml\n>> okay he was a saleserson\n>> well I think he kind of he kind of made\nsome arguments to me like I think that\nessentially when it all goes through\npaleumi It gets\n>> no because they even have like a full\nfull declarative interface, right? Which\nis um\n>> yeah, you can even define but to me\nthat's weird because YAML is always\ngoing to be like this domain specific\nlanguage type of approach.\n>> I guess he was implying that once you've\n>> thrown it into the Palumi whatever it\ngets it gets found out. I don't really\nknow but yeah I thought it was\ninteresting.\n>> I I also don't really know the details\nthere because one of the major drawbacks\nabout AWS CDK and the gsi ecosystem is\nthat you get a lot more capabilities\nwhen you write in Typescript because you\ncan make libraries or reusable\ncomponents in Typescript and then you\ncan consume them in Python or Node. Oh\nsorry in Python or Java or Golang or Net\nso you can generate\n>> but you can't make you can't go the\nother way.\nYeah, because all that gsi does is it\njust creates a binding uh from the other\nlanguages that under the hood calls\nJavaScript and you can't go the other\nway. You can't create a binding from the\nother languages back into TypeScript. So\nlike when I was evaluating it for like\nteams to work with, one of the things\nthat we do with CDK AWS uh Terraform\nCDK, what we do is we we're building\nreusable components like L2s. like I I I\nhave a common L2 library, but then the\nteams they're actually building type of\nvery customized L3s which are like very\nfocused on what they're trying to do and\nthey can do that in Typescript and then\nwe are publishing and consuming it and\ntranspiling it into uh Terapform\nconfiguration so it lands straight into\nour existing Terapform pipelines. So we\nhave all of our existing Atlantis, all\nof our existing Terraform modules and\nthey just neatly land side by side with\nno migration required. So if I\nunderstand you correctly, Vincent, you\nneed to write your your shared\nuh level two or three construct in in\nTypescript for it to be shared.\n>> Yes. Because like my whole my whole\npipeline is like you publish um an MPM\nlike code artifact private registry\npackage of your like I'm a product team,\nright? I have my um service definition\nwhich is an XJS or whatever uh or maybe\nit's just an expressjs or yes we are\ntypescript shop sorry um and and then or\na lambdas right because actually it\napplies much more to lambdas like let's\nsay that I am a product team and I have\na very serverless um solution that uses\nSQS SNS um and all this like bucket\nnotifications and lambdas and all that\nand and so I need to produce re reusable\nartifact that I can then deploy in my\ndev environ environment uh first you\nknow my sandbox evaluation environment\nand then my staging environment with\nmore integration points with other um\nyou know existing uh staging resources\nso I am producing a bundle uh an\nartifact that is actually a library it's\nan it's an IC little library and and the\nintegration\n>> IC IC library what what's that mean\n>> infrastructure as code library\n>> oh okay sir\n>> like a TF module is is kind of like a\nbundle or library right except you um\nyou don't really have the capabilities\nof defining strong interfaces and also\nthe library can't the module can't\nreally u modify itself depending on the\ntarget environment right whereas if I am\num in in Typescript\n>> the interfaces that I get are like\nstrongly typed and I have like I I can\neven create imperative type of\nreconfiguration like that the whole\nthing can can adjust itself towards its\ntarget and there's pros and cons right\nbecause the more flexible the more you\nget like um you know validation like\nmechanisms now I need to I have like a\nbigger interface right because I have\nmore ways I can be configured then more\nthings I need to test for the the the\ndifferent configuration\n>> exposure\n>> the\n>> the other thing that was demoed to me\nwith the Palumi just getting back to the\nPalumi thing was that\n>> um yeah their SAS offering seemed pretty\nrobust you know they had secrets\nmanagement they had stack management\n>> I mean I I I don't know if Terraform I\nmean the last time I used Terraform\ncloud or Terraform I don't know\nworkspaces or whatever it's called\nnowadays\nthey feel I mean is IBM even supporting\nit anymore because it doesn't seem to\nchange\n>> this was always the biggest problem of\n>> I don't get it like why why buy\nTerraform if you're not going to\n>> yeah I mean even the ter the cash cow\nyou know what I mean like\n>> I don't get it\n>> well IBM just been iterating on it\nrecently and Maybe part of deprecating\nCDKTF is to ensure that they can focus\non other areas. Although that there was\na skeleton crew on CDKTF. I don't think\nit actually took any of their headcount.\nBut it's a good thing they got rid of of\nthat that team. Not they got rid of the\nteam. They got rid of the product. Uh\nthe team is still there. The team moved\non. They work on more of the like core\nfeatures.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. But but go back to the Terraform\ncloud uh and the Terraform enterprise.\nOne of the biggest issues with Hashior\nCorp always and even Grab in Singapore\nwas leveraging Atlantis an open source\nsolution against Hashi Cororb saying\nlike look you're asking for this much\nmoney and I can get like most of it out\nof Atlantis in a more customizable way.\n>> Yeah. So, so they did hire the guy um\nyou know Luke Kaslau and um the other\nguy I forgot. Uh he's he's he's actually\nhead of product of of one component. um\nMikail he did I saw his presentation on\non Hashi Kate but but what I'm trying to\nsay is that they always lacked in in the\nexecution level of of the cloud solution\nand Pulumi is very strong there you know\nour by\n>> yeah it's really good the I did ask them\nthat like so you have multiple stacks do\nyou have like a dependency tree and the\nguy conceded that they didn't to my\nsurprise the outputs are strings\n>> like what what what grid does you mean\nsomething or or or what's it scon or\nwhatever you call it.\n>> No, what I do with grit which is like\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Well, you do grit but you\nyou were inspired by tacons or something\nweren't you or something. I mean it's\nterri ticons is my project. I was doing\ngrit. Tons I was inspired by open taco.\n>> Open taco. That's that's the one. Yeah.\nBut like but yeah I I mean we talked\nabout it last podcast and I like\nstrongly typed shift left like we have\nthat now. What's the next thing? Better\ndependency management with\ninfrastructure, right? I mean,\n>> yes,\n>> maybe.\n>> But it's very hard because like\n>> the argument that I hear the most from\nTerra team and state graph is that this\nis very hard to achieve with\ninfrastructure because you can't\nvalidate that your network rules work\ncorrect unless you actually deploy it\ninto that particular environment. And\nthere's always a difference because of\nthe side range differences and all. And\nso that's kind of like where they they\nsay you can't fast your infrastructure.\nIt's not the same as software delivery.\nAnd I can see that in a way. But I think\nif you have a strong language and you\nhave like strong interfaces, you can do\na lot more you can get a lot more\nconfidence in in the fact that you know\nit's going to work the way you expected.\n>> Well, I think it's yeah problem yet to\nbe solved. At least I haven't seen it\nsolved. I mean I've\n>> if you believe I should try your grid uh\nyour vibe code.\n>> Yeah.\nthe grid is great. Um,\n>> are you using it in production?\n>> I guess your your your attention is has\nbeen starved. You know, you're focusing\n>> so I have not I mean I I I have it\ndeployed in a PC repo with the intention\nof other people to validate it um in my\norganization but we haven't been able to\npromote it again because of like you\nknow\n>> cost cutting exercises across the board\nin every company that I talked to. I did\nI didn't see the the flow in Palumi\nactually. I was cuz it was like you know\ndidn't you didn't have a computer. We're\njust talking face to face. The other but\nthe the demo that kind of blew me away\nwas not a plume\n>> system initiative.\n>> No no not the system initiative.\n>> I can talk we can talk about that a\nlittle bit later.\n>> The demo that blew me away was the um so\nso qlang is like pickle. you define your\nconfig in a fancy fancy language.\n>> You got to choose which one. You don't\nknow. You can't you can't\n>> Well, I'm to be honest, I'm I'm leaning\ntowards Qang just because of some of\nquality of life aspect. So, the cool\nthing about Qang is like I don't know\nthat it changed the config, you know,\nlike scaled the memory, had more CPUs,\nand then it and then of course it can\nhook into pretty much anything. But they\nshowed a demo when it it did a terraform\nplan. And the cool thing about that was\nthat when the Terraform plan came back,\nit fed back into the Qang. So you could\nso you could actually see the change\nwithout like look, you know, like when\nyou do a plan, it's just like bloody\ninsane. And the cool thing about it, I\nhope I'm trying to explain it correctly,\nwas that is that it summarized the plan\nin a way that was like operationally\nsane like yeah, you've changed this and\nthat's and and that's because of this\nconfig change you and this plan cor like\nworks out how it is and then I I think\nthey've I'm not too sure if they\nimplemented it uh quite yet, but then\nthere's things in the works like the\napproval gates and things like I mean\nthis This is something that we struggle\nwith at my workplace is like we're\nchanging Terraform like we have to\ncontrol how it's done the audited\nwhether it's deleted whether it's\nupdated replaced we have to we have to\nunderstand what's going on because\nreading plans is just or there is this\nTF summarizer that we use but it's still\na nightmare. So the cool thing about\nthis was that it in the PR it like spun\nup a Q lang thing. I didn't even know\nyou could do this and it was just really\nfast and and nice. It was like\n>> but this is a framework on Qang. This is\nsome like this is a bunch of tools that\nthey built on top of Qang.\n>> Yeah, something like that. It's like a Q\nlang. I think they call it Q hub.\n>> Okay. I haven't heard about this.\n>> That that demo was impressive. But then\nand then some some other guy from\nUbisoft was giving a demo where I've\nnever quite seen this concept before but\nhe gave like I mean it was a bit\ncontrived but he gave the scenario where\nhe needs he's imagining like a thousand\nusers and then given a thousand users\nthen you can can say that given what the\napplication does you need you know a\nthousand megabytes of RAM and then and\nthen um and then basically\nthis model of how your application works\nbecomes config and then also that model\ngets confirmed in the observability. So\nyou have this sort of feedback loop\nbetween what's deployed, what's being\nobserved, what's your model, what's\nbeing deployed and you you go you go\nfrom there. And then of course he uses Q\nlang as a way of marking that all up so\nthat everything comes together and and\nand further validates the model. I\nthought that was I thought that was\nreally interesting. I've never I've\nnever seen it done that way before. But\nlike\n>> that's interesting. But like my problem\nwith all of these custom like I\nunderstand that a lot of organizations\nlike Google they even invented Qang\nspecifically to manage the problem of\nconfiguration. um meaning that you don't\nhave a full-fledged programming language\nfor configuration management. That's why\nthey built Quolang. That's why Apple has\nPickle. Um\n>> but I still I mean I think that's not\nnot a bad idea, right? Um the fact that\nthen you can use QAN to manage\nconfiguration like the same reason why\nJSONet exists, right? JSONet is a\nlanguage to basically, you know,\nimperatively kind of control the JSON\nconfigurations that you're trying to\ngenerate.\n>> Um but\nMy issue and I think I tried to tell\nthis to you as well when you send me\nsome of this this stuff is like great\nyou know that's yet another way of doing\nthe same thing on top of ter\nresources. Yeah, you're inventing a new\nthing. But the same way like with the\nsystem initiative, you're just creating\nanother way of, you know, doing CRUD on\nresources and that's not the problem,\nright? Doing CRUD on resources.\n>> Well, I wouldn't I mean that's a bit\nunfair because I I mean I think Q is\ntrying to get that one pager that over\nwhat that one pager of your of your\napplication system thing, right? Sorry,\nI can't I'm not too sure. Sorry, I can\ndo I can do one page.\nthat with my hands\nit's not trying to uh do CRUD operations\nof course like the interesting thing I\nwas talking to some of the QAN guys like\nyou know\n>> but you you delegate the problem you\ndelegate the CRUD to the to the to the\nterraform provider right as long as you\ndon't as you leverageing providers you\nget all of the\n>> CR but in an ideal world things would\nwould great I mean this is the way I\nunderstood what he was saying in an\nideal world things would vastly improve\nif you could actually give that whole\nconfig to the the cloud service provider\ninstead of doing all these CRUD\noperations because there's so much\ncomplexity in that Terraform provider.\nThere's so much stuff going on with all\nthose CRUD operations. In an ideal\nworld, you could just give the\ndeclarative config and that's that I I\nmean that's what we want to move\n>> which is what kind of like Kubernetes\npromises, right? You give it config\n>> and that's what crossplane also\npromises. You have to have a whole cloud\ncontrol layer like within Kubernetes. I\nwas chatting with a Kubernetes guy and I\nmean we all know this stuff but like but\nI just think it was I don't know maybe\nit's just a gig that I'm on like he was\nsaying like yeah when you when you put\nyour CPUs and your memory definitions\nand your deployment uh YAML the idea is\nthat you deploy it into your environment\nand then you constantly refine it\nknowing what the application\n>> okay was that was that was that um is\nthat the guy okay I can guess who Daniel\nwas that Danielle\n>> no it wasn't Daniel it was Okay,\n>> it was another guy. But but I thought to\nmyself, it's like this is so weird\nbecause or foreign to me because we have\nso like in my workplace we have so many\nenvironments\nand there's a pro promotion environment\nand like it's very very hard to nail\ndown the the resource limits. Anyway,\n>> yeah. So I just thought there's this\ncube learn uh from Daniel. They do some\nreally interesting like visualizations\nof how Kubernetes worked. They even got\nsome gigs where they they trained Apple\nuh engineers to on on communities. And\none of the recent things that he was\nreally into was to like how do you\nevaluate the actual you know resource\nrequirements of your deployments and he\nasked a lot of questions and spend a lot\nof time trying to see because they added\nnow they added virtual pod autoscaling\nas well. So before you could only like\nadd more pods, but now you can actually\nwith the control group V2, you can\nactually resize the number of CPU and\nmemory you give a pot without recreating\nthe pot, which is insane, right? And and\nand if you have those capabilities, then\nyou can like dynamically resize your CPU\nand memory.\n>> I still I still think it's pretty\ninsane in a way. I mean like\n>> Yeah, but um I mean that's just one\napplication level. Hold on. Wait up.\nWait up. Wait up. Wait up. I just need\nsome water.\nBut these are all the dials and knobs\nthat you get with Kubernetes, right? And\nthe problem for me is YAML the way to\ndeclaratively define it's insane. Then\nyou build languages on top like Q that\nbasically I I don't know do they use\nbecause cuz doing a demo from what you\njust said, right? He said Q is great if\nonly we could give it directly to the\nprovider uh directly to the cloud\nservice right and without having to go\nthrough these providers with all their\nlegacy assumptions. And then we\ndiscussed Kubernetes is a cloud\ncontroller interface that gives you the\nability to declaratively define a very\nyou know\n>> yeah I mean the guy behind Q is like the\nthe same guy behind uh Kubernetes\nactually. So I guess that's why he says\nstuff like that.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Well, if they built a\nconfiguration front end that uses Qang\nand then is able to manage the YAML um I\nguess great but um that's still\nI mean you still need a cluster to\ndeploy it and then yes maybe you can be\nuh like like up upbound which is the\ncrossplane SAS um basically we provide\nyou the cluster so you don't have to run\nyour own clusters and then you just work\npurely with crossplane so you just um\ndefine all\n>> no not crossplane Oh, getting\nsidetracked here. Okay, let's\n>> No, because you were talking about um\nyou know basically a control loop on top\nof the cloud service and an uniform\ncontrol loop and that's what crossplane\nis, right? They're a unifor uniform\ncontrol loop on top of the um\n>> Yeah, but Kubernetes or something. I\nmean, if you want to go\n>> what are you talking about when you like\nif you need to provision SQSQs and\ntopics and buckets?\n>> Oh, okay. You want to still do AWS?\nOkay. Yeah. Okay. I think I got you. I\ngot you. Yeah.\n>> Not necessarily AWS. I mean, any cloud\nthat you're using, you're still using\nmanaged services, right?\n>> Uh oh, God. Sorry. Well, let let's let's\ngo back to AI. Did Did you Did you Did\nyou see\n>> because that was part of your prompt\nlike\n>> did you see Adam did you see Adam Jacobs\ntalk? Did I did I share it with you?\n>> Uh is are they online? I don't know why\nI didn't.\n>> Yeah, it's online. Yeah, it was it was\ngood.\n>> Okay, that's good. Yeah. No, but like\nyou give me some notes where you you\nsaid like um it's going to be so much\ncode that we cannot control it and our\nrole is more towards validation. I mean\nI've hear the same thing for\n>> spot checking\n>> everyone I talk to.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> I think those are like Yeah. If you use\nthe AI you kind of like you got to be\nblind if you don't see that.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think everyone's coming to this\nconclusion.\n>> Yeah. the I you know what one thing I've\nalways found very polarizing in my\ncareer is sllock like source lines of\ncode and he basically just came up guns\nfiring saying that like that with AI you\ncan output 50k lines of code and he I\nthe point he was trying to make is that\nlike the force multiplier the utility\nthe uh the what AI can do is absolutely\ninsane\nand um I I mean 50k I mean what what is\n50k? It means nothing. It just but it\nmeans it's just it's just a number.\n>> I mean people just refer to that like\n>> huh\n>> Boris when he talks about all of the\ncode to plot code he he just says like\n500 PRs a week or something. It's all\nmanaged different.\n>> So yeah, he was he was talking about the\nvelocity. The velocity Yeah. My take\naway from his talk was that the velocity\nis now absolutely bananas\nand now the bottleneck is\ninfrastructures code because because\nbecause all that velocity needs to run\non some service. So we need to match\nthat velocity with the way that we\nprovide infrastructure as code. So yeah,\nit had me thinking like what is slow in\nmy organization like oh my god you know\nPRs are slow um our CDK stack\ndeployments and everything like that the\ncoordination and the releases is slow\nthe promotion is slow\n>> there's so much slow slowness in at\nleast\nin my in my workplace I find um for\ndifferent re not not just technological\nreasons I would say mostly\norganizational and approval\nreasons everything is so slow in my in\nmy client.\n>> Mhm. So yeah, it got me thinking and\nthis is why I was asking questions like\nlike\nnow I'm now I'm looking at my\ninfrastructures code pipeline and just\nthinking like like how can I make this\nfast\nso that um so I mean like I don't when\nyou develop with AI are you doing a\nTerraform plan and apply or or CDK\ndeploy and apply and and like don't you\nfeel that that's a bit slow or maybe\nwe're we're looking at the Oh\n>> no, because one of the things that you\nhighlighted in that Golang architecture\nfor AWS or that that cloud gave you was\nlike deployment time with AWS CDK is\nfast just CDK deploy. I think that's one\nof the main criticisms I hear about CDK\nis that you know cloud formation is so\nextremely slow. Um you know because it\ngoes and and it gives you this\ntransactional uh guarantees like it's\nall or nothing. So it starts to deploy,\nit starts to create backups, it try\nstarts to do all of this additional\nstuff and then if anything goes wrong,\nit does guarantee the full roll back\nwhich is super frustrating\n>> which never seems\n>> super frustrating work because then you\nhave something left behind then\nsomething you know prevents it from\nbeing destroyed and and it doesn't work\nright. Um\n>> but\n>> but that's the thing that you don't get\nwith terraform right when you run a fly\num if it doesn't go through totally it\njust left like that right and then\nyou're left to to figure it out it goes\nvery fast right it going to create\ndestroy everything and then it go like\nwhoop uh actually we're stuck good luck\nand there's no guarantee on on the roll\nback right which is what you don't get\nuh with terafform it does make\neverything feel much faster because you\nhave these individual resources all\ngetting created super fast but you're\nthen you don't have the transactional\nguant guarantee right so that was one of\nthe things that I was trying to solve\nwith my friend when we were uh because\nhe heavily relied on this cloud\nformation guarantee uh doing cross\nregional deploys because that's another\ngreat thing about cloud formation it's\nbasically available in every region so\nyou want to do a cross regional deploy\njust kick it off and it goes um but then\nwhen we looking at like moving over to\nTerraform we we are like oh [ __ ] now we\nare responsible because we're like like\nthe fly.io IO right now we are\nresponsible for like what if the\ndeployment failed how do we roll back\nand I'm like yeah I can't tell you you\nknow could be so many reasons why ter I\njust had the thought that um I made a\nvideo about this a month ago or two I\njust had the thought that like\ndata aside what probably works best for\nAI is just having its own AWS account\nwhich it just bootstraps from from\nscratch and when that AWS account\nbecomes comes crofty. It just basically\ndeletes it AWS account.\n>> Nukes it.\n>> Nukes it and starts a new one. What is\nthat? There's probably a name for it.\nIt's uh I don't know like\n>> ephemeral.\n>> Pardon?\n>> Sounds ephemeral.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Ephemeral. Yeah. I think AI\nneeds more ephemeral environments. Oh,\nbut in my current workplace, just\ngetting an account vended is really\nreally really really hard. No. And I I\ndon't know how we can even close it. But\nyeah, a firmware environment surely\nseems like an an AI friendly pattern.\n>> Well, everything has data. You know, the\nbiggest problem with environments is\ndata. You know, how do you like even\nreplicate or even when I want to do a\nfull integration test with with full QA\nautomation end to end? How do I get\nrealistic data? Do I have seats for\neverything? Do I replicate production\ndata? Do I, you know, mask out all of\nthe information like some\nquestion. Yeah, I don't think anyone\nreally talked about data and AI, but\nthat was probably the missing piece of\nthe puzzle for me.\n>> Another we have a job. If this was all\nsolved, we wouldn't have a job,\n>> I suppose. God, you sound really\nBelgian. Um, maybe it's all the Flemish\nI'm hearing. I one other demo before\nbefore I need to probably run out\nscreaming is um which I found really\ninteresting and that really proves the\ncat is out the bag was this guy was\nshowing that his new framework laptop\nwith the AI Max chipset and\ninterestingly he had like he had like I\ndon't know\n>> open clocks\n>> he had 180i he had 128 gigs of RAM or\nsomething and the cool thing he said is\nthat this new AMD Mac AI max one the\nUSPS. One of the key features is that\nyou can dedicate your RAM to the GPU and\nmake your GPU even more powerful.\n>> So he basically KVMED into his machine\nwhich didn't have any internet. And then\nhe he's also the author of era which is\nlike this uh anible playbook um sort of\nUI where it like logs how long the AI\nplaybook took to run and what the inputs\nwere and and what the logs were. So\nbasically he managed to configure his\nhis framework desktop to diagnose\nfailing playbooks\nand he was just using you know Alama and\nuh I don't know the GP GPT\nwhatever or the Z or what I don't\nwhatever local models\n>> GM\n>> and it was just ch it was just steaming\nthrough all these playbook errors and\nfixing things you know missing updating\n>> local models nice\n>> yeah updating Postgress libraries,\nfixing errors.\n>> It wasn't a prepared demo at all.\n>> Huh?\n>> It was probably Postgress from 5 years\nago. Well, within the training database\nof the of the local maybe, maybe.\n>> Just kidding. I'm just kidding.\n>> But the the demo was compelling because\nu you know how it is. It's like or you\ndon't want to use AI because it's you\nknow uh it's only used to be become\ndependent on anthropic and open AI. But\nno, hell no. This shows that we have the\nability to run it locally. Of course,\nthe model the model is not as capable as\nclaude, but it's damn well the cat is\n>> but think about it.\n>> Those local models now are like 04\ncapabilities and 04 like chain of think\nof of of thinking.\n>> Why you say 04? I mean, okay, whatever.\nbecause they they they do compare like\nthe the uh GPT OSS are equal to 04 is\nGPT04 like the the first\n>> reason I think 34 I mean the whole\nbloody versioning thing doesn't really\nmake sense but like\n>> yeah it was 01 04 because they went GPT3\nGPT4 then 01 then 04\n>> even even six month or one year old\nmodels at this point are actually pretty\ncapable for some for some tasks\n>> so yeah like so like Of course, anyone\nthat's listening to us right now, I\nwould say that like the best model at\nthe moment is the Claude Anthropic 4.5\nOpus or or SA. It's\n>> So, you just got a sponsorship, is it?\n>> No, this is # notsponsored. It's It's\nlike It's $20 a month to get on pro. Of\ncourse, you get limited quite heavily if\nyou do anything hardcore, but like like\nguys, the sun is shining. The sun is\nshining. Make hay.\n>> Wait, you're in uh in Belgium and the\nsun is shining. I can imagine you're\nhappy.\n>> I think there's something something\ngoing weird. Is Is the AI Did the AI do\nthis? Is the AI listening?\n>> So, there's this that happened. Um\nOh [ __ ] Is there sensitive information\nhere? Probably just\n>> your your locations maybe. Hmc.\n>> Um what is this? Oh,\nyou now you you're now a big boy wearing\nbig boy pants.\n>> Just up just upgraded this morning. I\nfelt like I'm\n>> Have you Have you already hit the limits\nknowing you?\n>> No, no, no, no, no, no. I was I was\nrunning out of limits on pro every week\nlike within 3 days and I was like that's\nit. I need I need for the next few weeks\nI have quite a lot of things to I have\nto do and I need\n>> I'd be curious if you hit the limits cuz\nit's like it's that classic isn't it?\nIt's like you get the back now. Now\nyou're over overprovisioned and now\nyou're like thinking, \"Oh, I'm not using\nit enough.\"\n>> Yeah, I know. This is definitely going\nto lead to some burnout.\nSo, yeah, I'm um I'm probably going to\nyou're probably going to have to cut\nsome vision like put some black boxes\nsome places because I just showed part\nof my credit card. I don't know if that\nwas going to help you with the last four\ndigits of your credit card.\n>> Yeah, it's true. And it's also there's\nno money on it.\nBut that's not how credit cards work.\n>> Max plan. I can just imagine like people\npanhandling on the streets.\n>> I need money for my max pan.\n>> Hey, you're kidding. But I do think that\nthat's what's going to happen next.\n>> No, no, no. I mean, I was just going to\nbecome elite.\n>> What?\n>> It's going to become only accessible to\nsome people.\nWell, when you talk about panhandling, I\nI I really think some people are not\ngoing to get access anymore.\n>> Come on. My earlier story was supposed\nto point out that for for four grand,\nyou can basically get a less capable\nmodel, but run it locally.\n>> For four grand of hardware,\n>> that's only four grand he spent.\n>> Yeah, the framework laptop is 4,000\nCanadian or something.\n>> Okay. Okay, that's not too bad. So, you\ncould argue that, you know, with the\nmoney I spend every month, I could have\njust bought and depreciated it. I still\ndon't think it's the same, though. Um,\n>> yeah, it's difficult like, yeah,\n>> you know what? What convinced me to to\nbump it up? Not just that I was hitting\nthe limits on Pro, but also that the\nrecent cloud code announcements. So,\nthey added um like task dependencies.\nSo, you basically have beats built into\ncloud code, right? The ability\n>> Oh, that's all that's all in cloud code\nright now. Yeah. Like since I've been\nsince I've been in a conference for a\nweek, I feel like I missed a month's\nworth of announcements.\n>> What did I miss?\n>> So So I I should share with you the\nvideo from the guy who used to do\nspeckit at Microsoft and he now he's now\nanthropic, right? Dan I forgot his last\nname, Dan de Demen something. Um and he\njust broke down the future of cloud\ncode, right? He he's he's obviously very\nexperienced with like he highlights some\nof the techniques that you use and they\nare very very heavily used in in speckit\nwhich is um the templating um so\nbasically you give the model a template\nof what a plan looks like right and and\nspeckit does that when you run the\ncommand it executes a script and that\nscript prepares it template in the right\nplace and then it tells the model read\nit these are the things you need to do\nand it follows a template right so you\nget very consistent\n>> why do you call it a template I mean\nthat could be a skill couldn't Yeah. I\nmean, why do you\n>> what's the difference between a template\nand a skill?\n>> It's a combination because like now\nskill and commands, they're very\nsimilar. You can like invoke skills the\nsame way that you can invoke commands.\nSo, what used to be a command has been\nrenamed to skills. So, skills and he\ncalls it the templates approach because\non one side you have a skill that gives\nyou instructions of the steps to follow,\nbut on the other side you have a\ntemplate of the actual artifact that you\nwant to produce. If you're talking\nspecifically about plans and and tasks\nand execution of what your agents are\ngoing to do, you need to have a certain\num you know level of information within\nthese specifications that the agents can\ndo it correctly without um confusion.\nRight? So the the biggest issue is um if\nyou do VIPE coding, you are missing\nintent and you're missing some of the\nlike you're you're letting the model\nmake assumptions and you're leaving some\nof the edge cases out without your\ndecision and that leads to unexpected\nresults. So when you are following this\ntemplate model, you are capturing those\nrequirements and you are eliminating\nthose assumptions and those um blurry\nlines. So so that's part of the spec\nkit. Uh and\n>> I guess the template implies that things\nneed to be captured perhaps.\n>> Yes, the template has your minimum\nrequirements and he doesn't do only the\ntemplate because he also adds on top\nthat you have the hook validation hook.\nSo when the agent walked worked through\nthe template and captured all of the\ninformation according to the template\nand the task and the user specification\nthen there's a validation hook like he\nuses actually um the one that you\nmentioned like the the Astra TY the type\nthing. He actually validates that the\nthe template has the attributes um\ndeterministically like this particular\nspecification documents or requirements\ndocuments has this section this section\nthis section are all valid it doesn't\nyou know validate the contents but it\nvalidates the section exists uh and\nthat's also what ko does right when you\nare you know building your your your\nplan to to to feed it to agents to\nexecute because ko is all about the\nupfront planning everyone that uses AI\nlately they all say you spend 80% time\nup front planning 20% of the time is is\nthe agent executing right that that\nexecution load like what what Adam just\nsaid as well it's just generated just\ngoes on right and your job as a human\nwith your limited amount of effective\nhours and attention span you are um in\nin in charge of like making the critical\ndecisions\n>> Adam Adam was saying that we all need to\nread the u the domain driven design book\nwhich I think is written by like um a\nthought worker um 100% or ex thought\nworker. I mean have you have you ever\nactually dived into domain uh driven\ndesign yourself?\n>> Yeah there so many times I've wanted to\nand I've never really spent a lot of\ntime on it. So like anyway with with all\nthe specit stuff we I mean you missed\nthe specit to me did you find the stuff\nany improving I guess it's just more and\nmore integrated with clawed code right\nit's nothing\n>> yeah so the guy who built who who wrote\nlarge parts of specket and you know\niterated through a lot of the prompts\nand set this all up aside from the idea\nhe worked with someone at Microsoft that\ncame up like that that that lead led\nwith the idea he's the guy that actually\nbuilt the specket now at Mantropic he's\nintroducing a lot of these\nfeatures on top of the cloud code suite.\nSo if you watch his video, it's not on\nhis um official channel like he has a\nseparate channel which is like um how\nyou call like indie dan. Yeah, that's\nhis because like independent it's it's\nlike\n>> oh\n>> and yeah and there he actually goes down\nhe talks about the validation hooks he\ntalks about the template uh approach and\nthen he talks about my god\n>> yes and then he talks about the agent\nsystem because you were able to do\nagents but the the co coordination\nsystem was bad right I told you I tried\nI I had all of my plans worked out I had\nidentified parallel tasks perfect for\nparallel agents right because there's no\nway that these agents will step on each\nother's toes if they're completely\nworking on separate parallel tasks.\nWrong. Cuz there was assumptions in\nthere in in the in the tasks in the\ncontext that they got which was like\nthere's this shared library and each one\nof them implemented the shared library\nand things like that. Um so that\nrequires coordination between agents uh\nand and like Gasttown and others they\nuse agent mail and more traditional\nsystems of like agents messaging each\nother and I think they're building\nGasttown now directly into cloud code.\nSo that's why I upgraded because I felt\nlike Opus is not going to like my my my\nbasic access to Opus is not going to cut\nit.\n>> Okay. There's a there's a lot going on\nhere. So do you still use beads is what\nis was at the top of my mind?\n>> At the moment I am uh because what I'm\nworking with is something cloud code\nindependent but I also feel that I\nupgraded because I wanted to see what\nthis is going to be. you know this thing\nthat then uh showcased where he\nhighlighted some of the core concepts\nthat I see in in specket reapplied into\ncloud code and the concept of agent\nswarm directly in cloud code I felt that\num I don't know if I will be using beats\nin that scenario right uh I talked to\nother people they they use GitHub issues\nand other stuff like that um\n>> so does this t I mean have you played\nwith this crawl code or has it just been\nannounced is it live like does it save\nthe tasks to to some to some database or\nto some\n>> it has its task like it has it memory\nsystem so it has the ability to save\ntask across sessions that's one of the\nfeatures of this new task system\n>> because it is it able to do what beads\ndoes like you know\n>> it has dependency it has the ability to\ndefine this task locks test task and\nthings like that\n>> yeah it they build all of that into\ncloud code now so if you if you consider\nall of that the reason to use beats\nbecomes a loss less if you are go full\nin onto cloud code So that's kind of\nlike where I'm I'm I'm feeling out.\nThat's why I want to explore\n>> because I remember talking to you and\nyou were like getting uh Gemini to\nreview the output from claw code. Those\nsort of workflows are going to I guess\nbecome harder and harder to do if you go\nall in, right?\n>> One of the thing the points that Theo\nmade about the move from Entropic to not\nallow people to use their subscription\noutside of cloud code and and\neffectively shut down anyone that does\nand ban their accounts. um is because\nthey want to make it very sticky, right?\nThey not the model alone is not the and\nI think we know Opus by itself is just\non par with the toolkit that they want\nyou to stick to. So that's why they are\nlike building the toolkit.\n>> Yeah, it seems sad though and\n>> yeah, it would be very like I also I\nalways said like I keep my options open.\nI don't go following full in on any of\nthem. But with the recent evolution and\nthe way that Antropic is leading and I\nalso think like I think KO is actually\nbecause AWS has invested into Antropic I\ndon't know how Kir is affected by this\num you know this this decision of how\nyou get to use the model but KO uses\nentropic models right um so I think Kiru\nmight have an edge there but I still\nfeel you know I still feel cloud code is\nlike ahead even though that most people\nhate the leadership of Antropic\nwith with all of his, you know, like\neven even\n>> Well, it's a bit anti-competitive, but I\nguess they're trying to build they're\ntrying to build a moat. Trying to build\na moat.\n>> Yeah. And they're like, you know, don't\nsell GPU to China. That's an like and\nall that. Like they're very vocal about\nthose things. And\n>> what about other announcements? I mean,\nI I mean, I can't help but think be a\n>> Yeah, I'm being a shenan friend to open\nAI. They don't seem to do anything that\nseems to capture my attention lately.\n>> Yeah. So, I shared with a friend that I\njust went in on on Max and he's like,\n\"What are you doing?\" Because OpenAI\njust uh you know, double.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. They just released this new UI and\nand and Tio did like a very nice uh\nbreakdown um comparing it. Uh like I I\nused to complain a lot about Teio, but I\nthink I I\n>> Did he did he do an honest thing and say\nthis is junk and open AI and Claude is\n>> No. Yeah, he he had to he had to frame\nhis video very heavily with like I am\nnot being paid by OpenAI blah blah blah\nblah blah but Codex is amazing.\n>> Um so it was interesting to see he\nbasically said they took all of the good\nstuff of anti-gravity which is the agent\nmanagement and they made it accessible\nin codeex so that you can run multiple\nagents across work trees. They made the\nability to use work trees more intuitive\nso you can see all of the work trees\nthat exist and switch between them very\neasily.\n>> Have you tried Have you tried it\nyourself?\n>> No, I only watched\nIt looked like a very It looked like a\nco-work ripoff on the face of it. I\nmean, it looked\n>> okay. I haven't tried co-work.\n>> It just looked like another like fat\nelectron app. It looked very uninspiring\nto me.\n>> Okay. So, a lot of like So, somebody\ntold me like, \"Hey, Open AI just doubled\nthe usage limits because I was like, but\nwhen I I went from Pro, I went to max,\nwhich is five times my usage limit, but\nof course at um three times the cost. Um\nbut um Oh, no. Is it It is actually\nfive. Wait,\n>> it said five I think it said 5x on your\nearlier share.\n>> Yeah, it says 5x usage, but the cost is\nalso not triple. I think it's also more\nthan anyway doesn't matter.\n>> 5x decision\nproductivity.\n>> It's like no buyers remorse here.\n>> No buyers remorse here. No impulse\ndecision.\n>> And\n>> okay, cool. I have to go also.\n>> Okay, you have to go. But like talking\nspeaking of buyers remorse, I I did find\nit very interesting. A colleague said to\nme that like Claude is basically making\nyou feel like you're at a gambling\nmachine. It make it's making it\naddictive to do the thing. And I think\nyou might be addicted, Vincent. You\nmight be hooked by\n>> is this an intervention? If the next\ncall I join and there's five people on\nthe call, I'm going and my wife\n>> when says it was a great idea. Maybe it\nwasn't Vincent. That's all I'm saying.\nWhen you when you started saying using\ncloud is like a gambling machine, my\ninitial reaction was this guy never\nheard of specit. This guy doesn't know\nhow to how to you know get the quality\ncontrol if he cannot control.\n>> Oh okay. No no I mean it is very\naddictive this whole stuff. Okay. See\nyou. Thanks for the chat. I'll publish\nthis sometime.\n>> Enjoy K. Enjoy the sunshine.\n>> Thank you. Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–4:11]\nHello. Where are you? >> Can you recognize? >> That looks like a ugly city. >> Sure is. >> Yeah. I I miss Kent. >> Yeah, it's actually it's pretty good. I just I just been enjoying walking around actually. It's been fun. And the architecture is pretty amazing. Like I'm confused cuz I I always thought to myself that like I don't know that that um that Europe is dying. >> Well, yeah. Exactly. But like the buildings there are quite wellmaintained and rich. You know what I mean? It's like confused. >> If you believe certain politicians, it's all you know run over by crime. And >> maybe maybe that's still the case. >> Yeah. And there's a lot of like um you know young beautiful people walking around and uh Yeah. It's quite it's quite different to London. I'd say >> cuz I'm old now. See why hair cannot be there anymore. >> I'm I'm freaking Gandalf right now, man. >> Yeah. So yeah, Belgian's been great and yeah, the conflict management camp was good. I mean, I think it's actually the best infrastructure conference on the planet, I dare say. >> Is it now? >> And you missed out on >> Yeah, I did uh fortunately um after some information around holiday period, I had to >> lock in some uh contracts and deals and it's been going great. So, unfortunately, I couldn't make it to config management camp, but I was able to do different things. >> So, this is all CDK ter was it CD? what do you call your your >> DDK terrain it's called now hey actually your your your proposal of the Golang um setup of a project and hosting on AWS where on one side you evaluate cloud form versus the AWS CLI and AWS CDK uh but you're not evaluating Terraform in there um you're comparing it against cloud for >> well that that plan that I sent you like I >> I I thought I wouldn't influence it that much but I asked Claude >> to give me what it wants to do. >> And funny enough, it didn't mention Terraform. Like I was I started the prompt saying like >> that's interesting. >> Like what how would you um and I I think I I should have shared the prompt, shouldn't I? I think I was opt I was optimizing for speed and operational simplicity and that's what and and CDK came up top. So yeah. >> Yeah. But like >> even if you look at the data of that like um report that was shared by Matt Gawi um but it's it's AWS usage data report about how people deploy on top of AWS. Cloud formation was by far the the highest used and then there was Terraform right after and then there was AWS CDK. You know, I I I find it…\n\n[slide:2] [3:51–12:13]\nyesterday. I was pretty impressed with what they >> they're doing really cool stuff. Yeah. No, no. I have to say like if you consider CDKTF and Pulumi as as like competitors, I don't think that's true because I I mean I was naive. I I did originally consider them. Uh but then somebody showed you know wisen me up and and showed me some of the really cool stuff because Pulumi is a host engine that allows your um your infrastructure code to hook into some really advanced features that you can't do with Terraform declarative configuration or you can't do even with CDKTF unless you have some type of like the the runtime the host environment in which your your TypeScript or Python or Golang you know the host is is giving the infrastructures code a lot of like dynamic capabilities of lookup and AWS CDK does some of that because you you do have the CLI able to host >> what do you mean the host like the their SAS application what do you mean by host >> no no no like the puli host so when you run the when you run your infrastructure configuration application it's an application right when you run it in puli it runs inside a host that runs your >> like the kubernetes model like desired state is it why is it like that? >> Uh no it's like you know because ultimately puli uses the terapform providers so under the hood at least originally. So, so what what it does give the program, you know, because your Terraform, sorry, your TypeScript is a program that executes, right? And it exposes some functionality to that program that you write that can do things like custom or tailor make tailor my Terraform or my my provider resource configuration to the target. So it does like it it's called environment agnostic or um environment aware setups. If you give it information about the target environment, it can actually uh provide um details. Oh, sorry. Uh I just have to reply to someone. >> So so that that it does it does that's the power of puli to me. um that you're >> the the question in my mind when I approached the Palumi desk was like I guess I was coming from an AI uh perspective in the sense that like since Palumi offers different language bindings and of course it does straight up YAML what would be the best language for uh AI to use given all those choices and the guy interestingly said like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter which I thought was quite curious >> he said it doesn't matter like what is the best language to like the front end the the…\n\n[slide:3] [11:53–20:15]\ncloud uh and the Terraform enterprise. One of the biggest issues with Hashior Corp always and even Grab in Singapore was leveraging Atlantis an open source solution against Hashi Cororb saying like look you're asking for this much money and I can get like most of it out of Atlantis in a more customizable way. >> Yeah. So, so they did hire the guy um you know Luke Kaslau and um the other guy I forgot. Uh he's he's he's actually head of product of of one component. um Mikail he did I saw his presentation on on Hashi Kate but but what I'm trying to say is that they always lacked in in the execution level of of the cloud solution and Pulumi is very strong there you know our by >> yeah it's really good the I did ask them that like so you have multiple stacks do you have like a dependency tree and the guy conceded that they didn't to my surprise the outputs are strings >> like what what what grid does you mean something or or or what's it scon or whatever you call it. >> No, what I do with grit which is like >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, you do grit but you you were inspired by tacons or something weren't you or something. I mean it's terri ticons is my project. I was doing grit. Tons I was inspired by open taco. >> Open taco. That's that's the one. Yeah. But like but yeah I I mean we talked about it last podcast and I like strongly typed shift left like we have that now. What's the next thing? Better dependency management with infrastructure, right? I mean, >> yes, >> maybe. >> But it's very hard because like >> the argument that I hear the most from Terra team and state graph is that this is very hard to achieve with infrastructure because you can't validate that your network rules work correct unless you actually deploy it into that particular environment. And there's always a difference because of the side range differences and all. And so that's kind of like where they they say you can't fast your infrastructure. It's not the same as software delivery. And I can see that in a way. But I think if you have a strong language and you have like strong interfaces, you can do a lot more you can get a lot more confidence in in the fact that you know it's going to work the way you expected. >> Well, I think it's yeah problem yet to be solved. At least I haven't seen it solved. I mean I've >> if you believe I should try your grid uh your vibe code. >> Yeah. the grid is great. Um, >> are you using it in production? >> I guess your your your attention is has been starved. You…\n\n[slide:4] [19:55–28:17]\nyou know >> but you you delegate the problem you delegate the CRUD to the to the to the terraform provider right as long as you don't as you leverageing providers you get all of the >> CR but in an ideal world things would would great I mean this is the way I understood what he was saying in an ideal world things would vastly improve if you could actually give that whole config to the the cloud service provider instead of doing all these CRUD operations because there's so much complexity in that Terraform provider. There's so much stuff going on with all those CRUD operations. In an ideal world, you could just give the declarative config and that's that I I mean that's what we want to move >> which is what kind of like Kubernetes promises, right? You give it config >> and that's what crossplane also promises. You have to have a whole cloud control layer like within Kubernetes. I was chatting with a Kubernetes guy and I mean we all know this stuff but like but I just think it was I don't know maybe it's just a gig that I'm on like he was saying like yeah when you when you put your CPUs and your memory definitions and your deployment uh YAML the idea is that you deploy it into your environment and then you constantly refine it knowing what the application >> okay was that was that was that um is that the guy okay I can guess who Daniel was that Danielle >> no it wasn't Daniel it was Okay, >> it was another guy. But but I thought to myself, it's like this is so weird because or foreign to me because we have so like in my workplace we have so many environments and there's a pro promotion environment and like it's very very hard to nail down the the resource limits. Anyway, >> yeah. So I just thought there's this cube learn uh from Daniel. They do some really interesting like visualizations of how Kubernetes worked. They even got some gigs where they they trained Apple uh engineers to on on communities. And one of the recent things that he was really into was to like how do you evaluate the actual you know resource requirements of your deployments and he asked a lot of questions and spend a lot of time trying to see because they added now they added virtual pod autoscaling as well. So before you could only like add more pods, but now you can actually with the control group V2, you can actually resize the number of CPU and memory you give a pot without recreating the pot, which is insane, right? And and and if you have those capabilities, then you can like…\n\n[slide:5] [27:57–36:19]\ngoes and and it gives you this transactional uh guarantees like it's all or nothing. So it starts to deploy, it starts to create backups, it try starts to do all of this additional stuff and then if anything goes wrong, it does guarantee the full roll back which is super frustrating >> which never seems >> super frustrating work because then you have something left behind then something you know prevents it from being destroyed and and it doesn't work right. Um >> but >> but that's the thing that you don't get with terraform right when you run a fly um if it doesn't go through totally it just left like that right and then you're left to to figure it out it goes very fast right it going to create destroy everything and then it go like whoop uh actually we're stuck good luck and there's no guarantee on on the roll back right which is what you don't get uh with terafform it does make everything feel much faster because you have these individual resources all getting created super fast but you're then you don't have the transactional guant guarantee right so that was one of the things that I was trying to solve with my friend when we were uh because he heavily relied on this cloud formation guarantee uh doing cross regional deploys because that's another great thing about cloud formation it's basically available in every region so you want to do a cross regional deploy just kick it off and it goes um but then when we looking at like moving over to Terraform we we are like oh [ __ ] now we are responsible because we're like like the fly.io IO right now we are responsible for like what if the deployment failed how do we roll back and I'm like yeah I can't tell you you know could be so many reasons why ter I just had the thought that um I made a video about this a month ago or two I just had the thought that like data aside what probably works best for AI is just having its own AWS account which it just bootstraps from from scratch and when that AWS account becomes comes crofty. It just basically deletes it AWS account. >> Nukes it. >> Nukes it and starts a new one. What is that? There's probably a name for it. It's uh I don't know like >> ephemeral. >> Pardon? >> Sounds ephemeral. >> Yeah. Yeah. Ephemeral. Yeah. I think AI needs more ephemeral environments. Oh, but in my current workplace, just getting an account vended is really really really really hard. No. And I I don't know how we can even close it. But yeah, a firmware environment surely seems like an an…\n\n[slide:6] [35:59–40:50]\n>> No, no, no. I mean, I was just going to become elite. >> What? >> It's going to become only accessible to some people. Well, when you talk about panhandling, I I I really think some people are not going to get access anymore. >> Come on. My earlier story was supposed to point out that for for four grand, you can basically get a less capable model, but run it locally. >> For four grand of hardware, >> that's only four grand he spent. >> Yeah, the framework laptop is 4,000 Canadian or something. >> Okay. Okay, that's not too bad. So, you could argue that, you know, with the money I spend every month, I could have just bought and depreciated it. I still don't think it's the same, though. Um, >> yeah, it's difficult like, yeah, >> you know what? What convinced me to to bump it up? Not just that I was hitting the limits on Pro, but also that the recent cloud code announcements. So, they added um like task dependencies. So, you basically have beats built into cloud code, right? The ability >> Oh, that's all that's all in cloud code right now. Yeah. Like since I've been since I've been in a conference for a week, I feel like I missed a month's worth of announcements. >> What did I miss? >> So So I I should share with you the video from the guy who used to do speckit at Microsoft and he now he's now anthropic, right? Dan I forgot his last name, Dan de Demen something. Um and he just broke down the future of cloud code, right? He he's he's obviously very experienced with like he highlights some of the techniques that you use and they are very very heavily used in in speckit which is um the templating um so basically you give the model a template of what a plan looks like right and and speckit does that when you run the command it executes a script and that script prepares it template in the right place and then it tells the model read it these are the things you need to do and it follows a template right so you get very consistent >> why do you call it a template I mean that could be a skill couldn't Yeah. I mean, why do you >> what's the difference between a template and a skill? >> It's a combination because like now skill and commands, they're very similar. You can like invoke skills the same way that you can invoke commands. So, what used to be a command has been renamed to skills. So, skills and he calls it the templates approach because on one side you…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "A conversational debrief recorded after Config Management Camp in Belgium. Two participants walk through what they saw and heard: debates about CloudFormation vs Terraform vs AWS CDK, why Pulumi’s runtime model matters, experiments with config languages like QLang, limits of current dependency and validation practices, how AI changes velocity and testing needs, and early demos of local LLMs and cloud tooling that add task/agent features.\n\n[slide:1]\n## Config Management Camp first impressions\nHosts open on location and say the conference was excellent; one calls it possibly “the best infrastructure conference on the planet.” They recap missed sessions and a short exchange about a Golang AWS project plan that compared CloudFormation, the AWS CLI and AWS CDK but — by plan output from Claude — did not mention Terraform. They cite an AWS usage report saying CloudFormation is the most-used deployment method on AWS, followed by Terraform and then AWS CDK. The conversation notes CDK’s advantage of shift-left, compile-time checks and better developer ergonomics versus raw CloudFormation.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Pulumi as a hosted runtime\nPulumi came up repeatedly: unlike purely declarative Terraform, Pulumi runs your infrastructure code inside a host/runtime that can expose dynamic capabilities to the program (TypeScript, Python, Go). That host model lets you do environment-aware lookups and tailor provider resource configuration at runtime. The Pulumi rep reportedly claimed language choice \"doesn't matter\" for AI use because Pulumi exposes multiple bindings (including a declarative YAML interface), which sparked debate about whether language or host features matter more for automation and reuse.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Terraform, HashiCorp and dependency pain\nThey discuss Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, HashiCorp execution issues and how teams often prefer Atlantis to avoid vendor lock-in or high costs. CDKTF deprecation and shifting HashiCorp priorities were mentioned. The group wants stronger dependency management for infrastructure (beyond current state graph limitations) but admits the hard reality: you often can't fully validate network or cross-environment behavior without deploying into the target environment. Strongly typed interfaces and shift-left testing help, but the problem is not solved.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Config languages, Kubernetes and QLang\nSpeakers explore higher-level config/DSL approaches: QLang (in the spirit of Google’s config languages) and other DSLs that generate plans and summarize changes. QLang demos showed a workflow where a Terraform plan result is fed back into the QLang system so the PR shows a human-friendly summary of changes and links them to config edits; the presenter found this operationally useful. They contrast the ideal of handing a declarative config directly to the cloud provider with the current reality of CRUD-heavy providers. Kubernetes-style control loops and Crossplane were discussed as attempts to give a uniform control plane for managed services. An important infra capability mentioned: virtual pod autoscaling and cgroup v2 let you resize CPU/memory for pods without recreating them, opening new options for right-sizing.\n\n*“in an ideal world, you could just give the declarative config and that's that”*\n\n[slide:5]\n## Rollback trade-offs and ephemeral AI environments\nCloudFormation’s transactional, all-or-nothing deploy model is praised for guaranteed rollbacks but criticized for slowness and complex failures (resources left behind blocking destruction). Terraform is faster and more parallel but can leave partial state on failures, pushing rollback responsibility onto engineers. As AI increases code velocity (one talk mentioned outputs on the order of 50k lines of code as an example of the multiplier effect), hosts worry infrastructure becomes the bottleneck. A proposed mitigation is ephemeral, easily provisioned environments for AI to boot from scratch and destroy when “crofty” — essentially disposable AWS accounts that can be nuked and recreated — but teams face account-vending, data replication and masking challenges that complicate ephemeral testing.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Local LLMs, hardware and Cloud Code evolution\nA demo showed a modern laptop (large RAM, local GPU allocation to accelerate on-device models) running local models to triage failing Ansible-style playbooks and upgrade libraries without internet — demonstrating that local models can be practical for maintenance work. The hosts discuss model capabilities, noting Claude/Anthropic variants and comparisons to the GPT series and OSS models. Hardware cost examples included a ~4,000 (Canadian) framework laptop purchase as an alternative to paid API usage. Cloud Code announcements are highlighted: task dependencies, built-in agent/task memory, and tighter templates/spec workflows (Speckit-style templates + validation hooks) that aim to reduce ambiguous agent assumptions. They warn that bundling runtimes, agents and subscription bindings into a single provider can create stickiness or lock-in, so teams are weighing the convenience of integrated toolchains against portability and control. *“I think it's actually the best infrastructure conference on the planet, I dare say.”*"
