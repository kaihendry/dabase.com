    "content": "Transcript:\nOh man, it's it it's these weeks have\nflown by and there's so many\ndevelopments. Uh I don't know where to\nstart even like like uh Okay. What do\nyou think of the Gemini 3 Pro thing?\nHave you managed to get on it?\n>> Um I'm using anti-gravity and I got some\nGemini 3 Pro for free, so obviously my\nlimits are pretty bad. Um, and it has\nbeen I mean I started I'm like a day I'm\nshifted in in like 12 hours compared to\nwhen they announced it, right? But that\nalso means that I'm online when most\nAmericans that try it out are offline.\nSo I I have to fight with other\nSoutheast Asianbased people which not\neveryone is following the latest Gemini\ntree release. So the first day I had a\ndecent amount of work done by Gemini 3.\nIt was pretty good. The experience in\nanti-gravity was also pretty nice. It\ngives you a couple of new like things\nreviewing files. I haven't used cursor\nso I wasn't too familiar with like a\nproper IDE integration. I've given up on\nVisual Studio Code Copilot for a while\nalready. I'm purely in CLI land. So\nusing an IDE and you know it's it's\n[snorts] been a long time before the LM\nwas like rewriting the whole file and\nyou had to watch it rewrite and you go\nlike no don't change that. Ah and now\nit's it just instantly pops up with like\num this has changed this has changed you\ncan review this file. So it's pretty\npretty cool. Yeah\n>> because um I don't know if you saw that\nlink I sent you yesterday to some AR AI\nsummit with Steve Jger and uh\n>> it was it was live right? I I didn't\nwatch it live\n>> because I like to fast forward and so\non. So,\n>> well, I I just someone shared the link\nand I just tapped on it and like Steve\nJger was giving his uh his his spiel\nlive and uh it was pretty good. It\n>> It was a pretty good\n>> I definitely want to see that now. You\ntold me that he's talking about it. I\nsee a lot of improvements on the\n>> but like one of his like he says like,\n\"Oh, I needed to give a hot take and\nhere's my hot take. You're a bad\nengineer if you use an IDE by the end of\nthe year. Thought\n>> by the end of the year. Oh, that's a hot\ntake.\n>> Interesting.\n>> Like but like an IDE.\n>> Is he sponsored by Warp now? [laughter]\n>> Well, the thing is the AI summit was\nlike sponsored by I think Google and\nGoogle was like anti-gravity this,\nanti-gravity that. So I thought it was a\nlittle bit rude of him to to basically\ndrop a bombshell. Don't use an IDE. But\nlike I think it perhaps what he's trying\nto say is that you you don't need to\nedit code. You don't need to edit code.\n>> Yeah. Because you definitely want to see\nthose diffs and and and to be honest\neven cloud code is integrated within\nVisual Studio Code or whatever IDE you\nrun it. Every other ID is a V VS code\nfork anyway.\n>> Um so so it it's really nicely\nintegrated like it opens up the de for\nyou. You can clearly see it. those\nthings still need a proper and and what\nanti-gravity does really well is and I'm\nstill learning but it gives you like a\nproposal and I was like great like I\ndon't see where I need to click but then\nthere was a small button at the top\nwhich is like review and then you can\nlike highlight which they show I've seen\non the product demo and you can\nhighlight like here it made an\nassumption I say well this is a wrong\nassumption and then I feed back the it's\nlike a PR review you can just highlight\ndifferent sections and put a comment on\nthat\n>> it's like a different take on that whole\nplan mode include cuz I really like plan\nmode in the sense that it's like\nprompting you this this that like making\n>> now it's new right now now when it's\nplanning it goes like I have a couple of\nclarify questions and it it asks those\nquestions to you which is something that\nspeckit also did and now they kind of\nbuild it into cloud code like it goes it\ngoes off into a planning agent which is\nrunning Sony 4.5 goes through your code\nwith the requirements and comes back\nwith like a plan and some clarifications\nand it asks you like I have five\nclarifying questions and then you answer\nthem and you submit it and then comes up\nwith a plan which is a very nice uh\nexperience.\n>> Yeah. I mean I'm more CLI gang because I\nfeel like you know moving between the\nkeyboard moving like ABC like I can be a\nlittle bit faster cuz the ide can be a\nbit clumsy but it's it feels like we're\nalways going to go back we it feels like\nwe're going we're in this golden age\nwhere it's like terminal claw code. it's\nprobably going to last a few more months\nand then then they all go back to some\nIDE uh you know noob land or something\nlike that\n>> if they can address I guess the heart\nlike the problems that people have with\nIDs I know a friend of mine really likes\ncursor and he swears by cursor it's\nmostly front end maybe that's why I\ndon't know u but like another thing that\nI really like when you were saying about\ncurs um cloud code um terminal based\nview Gemini CLI did a big upgrade on\ntheir terminal all um you can do Ctrl S\nnow to go into selection mode and select\nthings and copy paste them and the\nscroll experience they say we fixed the\nflickering like you know cloud code\nstarts to disco um Gemini CLI has this\nnew way of of scrolling I found it slow\nmy machine is not slow but when I was\nscrolling it was sometimes a bit laggy\nbut if it fixes some of the like\nscrolling problems because if you're\nreading an LLM and it puts out a message\nand it scrolls all the way back down and\nyou have to go back to where you were to\nlike the thinking. It's so annoying.\n>> These little things are like so\nimportant, aren't they? Like that.\n>> Well, Gemini is doing a good like I used\nit two weeks ago. It was horrible. I\nposted it. It was on LinkedIn and I was\nlike that was a horrible experience.\n>> We were living in a golden age where\nlike this this competition between\nGemini and Claude. I don't know where I\nI I did use codeex the other day, but\nlike I was I was flabbergasted because\ncodeex doesn't have like support for\nproject based configuration and things\nlike this.\n>> Yeah. No, you Yeah, you want the prompt.\n>> I mean, how easy is that a feature to\nimplement? Like\n>> horrible.\n>> And you don't have a shell also like you\ncan't exclamation mark. And I've tried\nto search how do I run terminal shell\ncommands in inside codeex and it's like\nyou can't um which is\n>> Codex is basically off the map at this\npoint. I mean what?\n>> Yeah. Which is but then OpenAI says okay\nwe give Codex uh JGBD 5.1 CEX Pro to\neveryone. Right after Gemini was\nannounced Gemini 3. They go like hey\neveryone access to this now. [laughter]\n>> But I mean I don't really see the value\nin I mean I'm a clawed 4.5 gang still.\nI don't I don't get anything out of uh\nopen AI because like that that's the\ntrouble like people I think a couple of\nchats ago you were saying that you you\nput on auto but I'm I'm now thinking\nlike no I need claw 4.5 or or this is\nnot going to work\n>> auto\num like you you let it like auto approve\nand\n>> well auto choose the models like I'm\nchoose I want to choose the model\n>> yeah I also change um for Gemini CLI\ndefinitely I don't want it to go into\nflash. So, I don't choose it to I don't\nlet it choose. I I think that's mainly\nwhy I was having so many frustrations\nwith Gemini CI because they were going\ninto Flash.\n>> So, I mean like would you like if you\nwere ranking the models, would you say\nClaude is still top or would you say\nGemini is three 3 is now Eclipse?\n>> It's very hard to to say because my\naccess to Gemini 3 has been quite\nlimited. Like I said, um I haven't tried\nit in preview mode on on the paid\nsubscription of Gemini CLI. I'm using it\nin anti-gravity free. So, um\n>> I think I think you can assume you got\nthe you got the uh tasty experience\nthere.\n>> Yeah, I did some really cool stuff. Um\nbut again, like I don't I'm not doing\nbenchmarks cuz I find this is the\nhardest thing for me to make an opinion\nabout these things is I I Okay, so\nbasically what happened to me this week\nwas\n>> benchmarks are always like weirdly weird\nand manipulated. I think I think it it\nis that to go on fields basically.\n>> I don't think so because it's so hard to\nto basically I saw some Reddit posts and\npeople were like I gave all three models\nthe same prompt. This is how how they\nfared. I think that's a valid thing but\nI don't have time for that because like\nwhat happened to me was I I promised to\nget something deployed um by this by\ntoday like two hours ago. uh supposed to\nfinish it and I started on Monday and\nthen I realized I kind of underestimated\nit as usual as all software engineers do\nall the time [laughter]\nand maybe maybe not all just me then I\nguess um but\n>> I get it wrong.\n>> Yeah. So, so then what happened is I I\nhad to get things done and I was like\nwatch watching my weekly budget on\nentropic carefully because I cannot run\nout of tokens when I wanted to send it\noff.\n>> It's like a drug, isn't it? It's like,\noh, I check my supply. Yeah, I I kind of\nchoose what jobs I what I I will do\nmyself and like I don't let the model do\nsome stuff. But if I wanted to do like a\nheavy troubleshoot going across a 100\nfiles, I'd let the model do that, right?\nUh it's going to be a lot faster than me\ntrying to do it. If I have to rename a\ncouple of files and and and and do\nthings like that, I'm not going to say,\n\"Yeah, go ahead and go do that and\nwaste, you know, a million tokens\nrenaming files or or or you know,\nreading a whole file and then outputting\nthe same file into a new directory.\"\nThat's ridiculous. Yeah. So anyway, I\nwas kind of hitting close to the limits\nby by Wednesday and there was all this\nspeculation about like Gemini coming\nout, these batting screenshots getting\nshared. It was pretty cool to and funny\nto see all of that, but I was like\nbetting on it that it come out and then\nI have access to a free LLM on top of\neverything.\n>> And so\n>> the moment it came out, I literally have\nlike oh and I also have the cloud code\nweb version and I thought what you know\nI never tried it. I have $250 credits\nthere. Uh, and I thought given the API\ncalls a day for me, easily around $100.\n>> So, you have a different credit set for\nthe different\n>> Yeah. So, so with Entropic subscription,\nyou you get your cloud code access, but\nthen they give everyone that has a\nsubscription, depending on their tier, a\nnumber of credits. So, like if you're in\na prom max 200, whatever, you got like\n$1,000 to try out their web interface.\nSo, you can go to cloud.ai/codes AI/ uh\ncode and it's a web version of cloud\ncode. So you don't have all of your\nCLIs, you don't have like your\ncredentials, everything there. It just\nhave access to your git repo and it can\ndo some tasks. And I was like, I I want\nto try out a new um interface like a\nReact library of components. Uh and I\nwas like, you don't need any tools for\nthat. So I have $250 credits there.\nGiven the amount of credits I spend a\nday, $100, I think in three days, um I\nwill be able to spend $250. I I again I\nthought that this was going to be like\nAPI because the API is charged very\nheavily whereas you pay $20 a month but\nit telling me that I'm using over like\n$600 of API calls. That's how the tool\ntracks my calls and says this is how\nmany you are actually spending if you\nwere actually paying for every API call.\nSo So yeah. So so 250 I thought was\ngoing to be over in a minute, right? And\nit literally spent $8 only and it\nfinished. Why? Why is it because is it\nbecause the web one is more efficient?\n>> I don't know. Maybe it's because it's I\ndon't I I have no idea why the web was\nso efficient.\n>> So, are you are you on the max plan or\nthe pro plan?\n>> I'm on the pro. I pray $20 a month. I I\nI'm I'm diversifying, right? I have put\n$20 in OpenAI, $20 in, and $20. And just\nto reiterate what you were saying, so\nyou have you're on like a weekly limit\nby the sounds of things for the\n>> pretty much every provider gives you um\na 5 hour session token budget and then a\nweekly token budget. Before they only\ngave you 5 hours session token budget\nand then people were running it and\nsharing keys and they were just\nmaximizing it um by by having pools of\nkeys and so now they put uh like weekly\nbudget um which basically equates to\nabout 10 sessions that you 10 5 hour\nsessions.\nBesides like you know tracking your your\ntokens and your credits, have you been\ntrying to make your your prompts more\ntur? I mean I think we I think we agreed\nthat that MCP sucks. So\n>> yeah,\n>> have you dropped you you don't use any\nMCP servers?\n>> I I just run MCTP on my cloud\ncoordinates has zero MCPs connected.\nMaybe it's because you just updated.\n>> What other token optimizations have you\nbeen making?\n>> Okay, so\nI find these prompts are so difficult to\nget right unless you are running an eval\nsuite that evaluates your use cases to\nto make sure that the prompts still work\nwith the model and all that. I I I don't\nwant to write them myself. I don't want\nto maintain them myself. So I'm using\nspec kit and I've customized it a tiny\nbit. I removed anything that says you're\ngonna write out everything uh into a\ndifferent markdown file. I'm gonna make\nsure that you use uh beats Steve's thing\nto do the the issues, right?\n>> Be kit and and Steve.\n>> Yeah. And and it's going all right. I've\ntested it out. I I started recording. I\nsay this every time we talk like I have\ngot a recording, but it's like I'm still\nnot happy with it. [laughter]\nUm but yeah, it's going all right.\n>> Oh, by the way, can you can you take\ntake the framing out? It auto frames\nyour your face all the time.\n>> I don't know how to do that. Uh it's\n>> Are you Are you on me last time?\n>> I think I think it's called center\nstage. You just click the green icon and\nyou turn off center stage.\n>> Uh it's on Zoom.\n>> I'm not too sure. I think it's I think\nit's a a Mac feature actually.\n>> But where do I disable it then? Because\nI'm on a Zoom call. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Well, in in my in my in my Mac OS\nmachine, I have this green icon when\nwhen it's like showing the usage of the\n>> and then [snorts] you just click the\ngreen icon and\n>> enter stage.\n>> Oh, it was not on.\n>> Now it's Now it's off. Now it's on.\n>> Okay, there's something.\n>> Maybe. Okay, maybe go video settings. I\nIt's probably in video settings\nand zoom then. Yeah, it's zoom. Of\ncourse.\n>> Zoom doom doom.\n>> Video settings.\n>> Yeah. Autoframing. New. Turn that off.\n>> Video settings.\nVirtual background appearance.\n>> It's It's an appearance.\n>> Autoframing. Oh,\nokay. It's off. Wait. My video is off\ntoo now.\n>> Okay. It stops, right? Hopefully.\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay. But you were saying do you like\nhow do you keep your prompts st\nyour token usage down\n>> cuz like I'm like for example when I'm\nworking with\n>> uh Claude\nI need to give quite a lot of context\ncuz I'm working on a huge code base to\nbe honest and like I'm never too sure if\nit's like looking through my git logs.\nUm, I I know it kind of shows the\nthinking, but I'm like it doesn't like\nevery stage when it does the thinking,\nuh, it doesn't really give a good\nfeedback about how many tokens it's used\nor what it's actually consumed. So I so,\nso I'm always in this like gray zone of\nlike am I using my tokens efficiently or\nnot? But\n>> so there is this\n>> Yeah,\n>> there's this one person ship hu I think\nshe wrote a book about AI cookbook or\nsomething. She posted on LinkedIn a\nscript that parses through your cloud\nlocks, like your cloud code locks\nbecause, so this is interesting. When\nyou run cloud code, it stores all of\nyour conversations on JSON files in\nsomewhere home directory or somewhere,\nright? Including every single\nscreenshot. So if you take a screenshot\nand you paste it, that gets checked some\nu uh what's it called? Uh B 64 encoded\nand written down into this JSON file. So\nthey she said no not she some people\nsaid that there were like gigabytes of\nof of logs in there but maybe if you're\nreally curious about your token usage\nyou could try and she posted a script\nthat she did to parse it and it\nbasically in her case she wanted to look\nat how many times does um a tool use or\na command fail for example it tries to\nread the file and says I can't find it\noh I'm in the wrong directory I need to\ngo up a directory and so on right and\nshe says is like she analyzed how many\ntimes which commands failed and then she\nupdated her cloud autom to like specify\nlike if like focus on this focus on this\n>> there's definitely like people who are\nstarting AI consultancies right now and\nI can't help but think that would be\nlike a key tool some key tooling in your\nAI consultancy like you would you you\nknow if you're trying to upskill a team\nyou would want these logs or you would\nwant to run your your tool over those\nlogs\nto better uh train to make people better\nat using the AI.\n>> So I think this is a very good\nobservation that the fact that as an\nengineer we must know how to use these\ntools. Using these tools is not easy.\nthey changes so fast. Um, and there's a\nlot of\nAI slop being generated as solutions\naround these tools.\n>> Like the the signal the signal and noise\nis pretty intense.\n>> Actually, come to think of which which\nReddit are you on? because I I posted\nlike a genuine AI question on the VS\nCode Reddit and everyone was replying to\nme like I was like they didn't even\nunderstand what I was saying.\n>> The VS Code doesn't sound like somewhere\nyou would get I I'm usually on the\nentropic um on the LLM devs. There's so\nmany. I I have no idea. Like sometimes\nand but Reddit also suggests posts that\ndo not belong to any subreddit that\nyou're subscribed to, but because you\nvisited one Reddit, it will sub um it\nwill suggest these post because they're\nsimilar to what you normally look at. So\n>> usually if I see something nice, I I\nsubscribe to that uh subreddit and it's\nlike cloud code, cloud dev, llmdev. So I\nlike a whole list over time.\nBut but Reddit as as a platform seems to\nbe the the best one for you still.\nYou're not in you're not one of these\ndiscord disco bunnies. Nitro\n>> course is a bit like slack where you you\ncan have like a thousand slacks\nconnected and you don't remember. You\ndon't know what\n>> so busy so noisy.\n>> Also I have like agents of AI uh AI\nagents AI agents AI gamedev AI prompt\nprogramming.\nSo you you just hop between them and\njust just try to I mean\n>> it's on my front feet usually sl\nartificial\nartificial intelligence.\n>> The other person I the other person I\nlike to follow is is Simon Willis. Do\nyou ever like check out his blogs? I\nmean he blogs about AI like three times\na day almost.\n>> You shared it with me, didn't you? You\nshare me a blog post of him.\n>> Yeah, I like I like his work a lot. He\nand the thing that blew me away about\nthe Gemini 3 release is that he was\ntalks he he has his like own unofficial\nor official test of drawing a pelican on\na bicycle and the Gemini 3 did actually\na really good job compared to all the\nother ones. [snorts]\n>> There's also Chpt Coding and Chpt Pro\njust I thought those and yeah and Cloud\nAI cloud cloud code.\n>> So you're in like 20 Reddits. Oh my god.\nYou're you're living. You're you're\nyou're deep diving, man.\n>> No, I'm only listing the AI related\nones. Not [laughter] the other one. Not\nthe one.\n>> Cursed AI. Oh, no. Not Not that one. Not\ncursed.\n>> What about all the Don't you have any\nother interests like uh kite surfing or\nwhatever the thing?\n>> I'm not listing those.\nUm,\n>> I did did you see that thing on hacker\nnews about\nuh Europe relaxing their GDPR rules\naround uh AI? And um when I looked into\nthe comments, most most people sort of\ninterpreted this as a victory for\ncookies. So we don't have cookie banners\nanymore in Europe. It's funny, right? Uh\nthis whole cookie thing. But but coming\nback to the the the Simon Willis uh test\nof asking you to draw a pelican on a\nbike. Um we were talking earlier about\nlike benchmarks that that people run and\nI think that's a type of benchmark right\nthat's that's interesting that other\npeople um you know evaluate a model\nagainst um there was something\nuh I forgot because\nyeah usually I also just go off of like\nwhat other people say about like I've\ngiven if this test definitely if they\nare providing like receipts right if\nthey're saying here's is a repo. Here's\nthe assignment. Here's how they did.\nThis is what I saw. And then also if\nit's not like overexaggerated and\nrepeated cuz then it's like clearly AI\ngenerated and it's so painful to read\nthrough because it just repeats itself\nand you're like, \"Oh my god, can you\njust get to the point?\"\n>> That's actually a good telltale sign of\nAI. Sometimes it repeats, doesn't it?\nSo, that's funny because a lot of\nsubreddits um immediately ban a post if\nit has too many emojis cuz it's like\nclassic AI to generate emojis or m\ndashes and things like that.\n>> So, um yeah.\n>> Yeah.\nWhen I'm using Claude, I I I get it I\nget it to give me the solution and then\nwhen I validate it's working and then I\nfeel like I have to go through this\nuh step or stage or phase where where\nI'm basically saying less code, suck\nless,\nmake it more tight\nbecause it's\n>> Yeah. So it's pretty verbose by default.\nSo with the crunch that I'm under for\ndelivering something right now, I have\nand you were saying earlier you have a\nreally large code base and and you then\nwent on to say that it's very hard to\ncontrol how much token it's using and so\non. But when we go back to the very\nlarge core bait part um when you said\none of the issues I have I I just give\nit like a really big like seven-year-old\nGolang monor repo that I adopted like\nforked and added my own features on top\nand usually hacked them in. So, it's\nsuper messy code and I'm always like a\nlittle bit, you know, reluctant or I\nalways try to just find the different\npaths. I kind of know the codebase where\nit needs to go and change things and I\nwas like, I don't know. I'm going to do\nthis myself. But then I tried\nanti-gravity Gemini tree. It's a really\nlight 7-year-old codebase and it pretty\nit was I didn't have to give it anything\nlike I didn't have an agent. MD or\nanything like that and I said like look\nI I'm adding a new CLI. So the root\nright now main.go is at the root but we\nneed to move it refactor it so that the\nthe CLI are separate directory so we can\nmint or build the different binaries\nfrom it and and then we need to like\nhave a shared interface between those\ntwo binaries because one will write\nfiles on this the other one reads it. So\num where like I suggest we put it here\nthere I went a bit back and forth with\nHGBT on the web actually while in the\ngym which is pretty cool. You can just\ntalk and then you know brainstorm and\nthen I took the prompt gave it to the\nanti-gravity and it did an amazing job.\nIt did a really good job. And in terms\nof code, the test suite on that repo is\nquite extensive. I went in, I wrote my\nown tests in the in that one area. So,\nit's kind of like a golden.\n>> How do you write your test your in Go\ntests or what?\n>> Yeah. Um,\nit's funny because when I first started\nworking with this repository, I was very\nsurprised by their test approach. They\nhave like this golden files approach\nwhich is kind of very more popular now\nas snapshot testing when they just\n>> Oh, yeah. Um, Hashimoto talked about\nthat.\n>> I think you shared me a post or or it\nwas on Reddit.\n>> Hashimoto did a did a call did a talk\nback in 2007 of how they wrote no 2017\nof how they wrote Terraform and how they\nwrote wrote their test suites and he did\ndifferent testing mechanisms and then I\nsaw he did a newer one uh\n>> it was linked in the same YouTube video.\nSo I I I looked at the new one as well.\nVery interesting. But that's how the\ntests were written. So they were all\ngolden tests there. It's a directory\nwith all the poss like different\nscenarios of of the config file, which\nis ugly YL. I hate Yaml, but anyway,\nit's a like I said, seven-year-old\nthing. It uses a YAML file as an input\nfile. So, I just added a couple new\nfields in the config, and then I\nactivated those fields in the test uh in\nthe test data. I ran the generate all\nthe golden files. I reviewed it if it\nmakes sense. And then I just let uh\nGemini and the LLM do its thing. No\nmatter like the code I I saw like\nthere's a whole bunch of lines there and\nit's like duplicated and I committed\neverything and I said like hey can we\nlook at this and clean this up and it\nsays done it's cleaned up. I ran the\ngolden test fail error. I was like okay\nthere's something wrong because you\nduplicate like all of these additional\nlines are here that shouldn't be there\nand then the LLM says oh yeah my\nrefactor did not take into account this\nedge case and that add case. And I just\nwent like revert everything. I stick to\nthe commit. I [laughter] don't care my\ntests are passing. Um, I'm not going to\nbother too much. Again, under crunch, I\ncan understand that over time. Um, it\ncan result in a horrible spaghetti code\nand hard to maintain problems.\n>> So, it's kind of like the balance.\nClassic tech.\n>> Speaking of reverting a commit, I'm very\nnervous about letting AI make a commit.\n>> No. Yeah, I didn't revert to commit. I\non stage like reverted all the changes\n>> cuz sometimes claude\n>> last commit\n>> I feel takes some liberties because like\nI don't want it to uh do get commits. I\nshould put that\n>> absolutely not. No,\n>> I should put that in my claw. MD, but\nsometimes it does it. I'm like dude\nstop.\n>> Well, so I am very reluctant to let the\nLLM do a commit. I usually I usually\nstage the files and then I let I I\nprompt the LLM and then I look at what\nit did against the stage files and if\nI'm happy I then stage additional files.\nSo that's like I I should be committing\nmore aggressively myself but I'm just\nstaging files until I'm happy and I know\nthat things work and then I want to do\ncommit because I like my commits to\nwork.\n>> What is your workflow? cuz like for me\nit's like I um I'm using VS Code at work\nto be honest but but if I'm if I'm at\nhome I'm using claude code and then I\nhave another terminal where I'm like\nchecking the things that it does and\nthen in that terminal I'm also doing get\nads but I'm just curious if you are some\nin turbo lazy get mode or something.\n>> Yeah, so I have I have VS Code and I use\na shell the terminal in VS Code uh to\nrun cloud code which has an ID\nintegration. So that means cloud code\nwill open files into VS code to to show\nthe diff. If I didn't allow it to to to\nmake changes itself.\n>> Uh also I don't know if it always\ncaptures it but if you select something\nthen when you do a prompt it will say\nand you have also the selected so it\nreads your\n>> Yeah. Um and then what I do is I stage\nfiles that I like know that I'm happy\nwith the changes it made. Um just in the\nUI on the left and you're just gonna\n>> Yeah, I st but when I do the commits I\nalways do lazy get because I used to use\nG g I used to like sign my commits and\nfor some reason it doesn't I I don't\nhave it now with my latest laptop but\nI've got the habit now to always commit\nthrough the terminal um because the\n>> so you stage in VS Code and then you\njump into Lazy G to commit.\n>> Yeah. Yeah,\n>> it seems a bit more audible, but uh\n>> no. Um\n>> I I kind of like the VS Code commit\nbecause it does the automatic commit\nmessage summary.\n>> H you know um\nmy commit messages are kind of like just\nusually one headline of the feature or\nthe chore or the fix and then some\ncomments. Usually I look at the stage\nfiles that I look at like I go through\nthe files on the left while I'm looking\nat like oh we also added this oh we also\nadded that and then I just um yeah it's\nconventional commits and and some\nmessage body um but that's my usual\nworkflow\n>> but but then when you were saying\nearlier we're afraid of letting it\ncommit but when you work with cloud code\nweb and I I just like told it here's my\nrepo um integrate this new react\ncomponent library to replace my custom\ncomponents that that are kind of bad\nthat you wrote by the way. [laughter]\nUm, and then cloud code just created a\nbranch and of course it has the only way\nto get its work is by it committing and\nit was committing all the time and uh it\nwas pretty cool. I just pulled the\nchanges to my local and then made some\nchanges, pushed it and\n>> I guess that's like a that's like the\nthing I want to control. I can get yes\nor no. I can get yes or no.\n>> Oh [snorts] my god. So with the with the\nPR workflow that I'm setting up the\nrelease workflow now I'm I'm I'm doing\nrelease please with um with go releaser\nand I want the PRs to be merged uh\nsquash merged merged so no matter how\nmany commits it did on the branch it\nwill all become one commit when the PR\nis merged.\n>> Right. Right. Right.\n>> And that works well with with like\nrelease please to find what has changed\nand then it creates a release PR keeping\ntrack of every uh PR merge that\nhappened.\n>> Yeah. I mean when I'm devel I mean I was\ndeveloping like a Terraform workflow\nyesterday\nI I kind of wish that I could have got\nAI to do it but it was one of those\nthings where this [clears throat] a this\nworkflow was part of all these other\nworkflows and these all these other\nsecrets so you could only trigger it\nthrough GitHub workflow. So I was going\nreally really really slowly because I\nwas like get commit uh you know - a - m\nfix uh and and git push and then and\nthen triggering a workflow.\nOne good thing is that I got AI to to be\nable to read the the workflow error log.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then it can help me iterate on that\nthing. But it's still it was slow to\niterate and it was uh yeah\n>> CI/CD is always slow.\n>> That's why you need you need project\nlike earthly or what's it called? Dagger\nfrom the Docker Solomon.\n>> I've been I've been dipping into Dagger\nbut I never got much out of it. I mean\nhave you got any joy out of\n>> Did I say Docker Solomon? I meant\nSolomon hikes from Docker. Yeah, I\nhaven't.\n>> [snorts]\n>> So the I really like the idea behind\nDagger.\n>> Um because Doc Solomon says\nwe failed. If Docker is just a runtime\nfor containers, Docker failed um because\nthe idea was to improve the the\necosystem dev ecosystem, right? um\nDocker Docker Mac uh is basically a\ntransparent way of um getting things to\nwork on your machine and that their\nfocus was always dev tooling.\n>> Not super transparent to be honest, but\nyeah. Okay,\n>> that was their idea, right? The whole\nidea of um cloud when they released\nDocker, their internal container stuff\nwas dev tooling and they really\noptimized the dev workflow, you know, of\nbuilding and having it run across\ndifferent machines, right? build chip\nrun was always uh\n>> their their moto right um and so with\nDagger says I'm focused on the dev\nworkflow like CI/CD is horrible\nexperience we want to be the ability to\num reproducibly have our CI/CD pipeline\nand at the same time there was\nearthly.dev dev and there was another\none as well that were trying to do the\nsame thing\n>> but but but I mean they must have failed\nbecause I don't know anyone who's doing\nthis stuff locally everyone GitHub\nworkflows have won the day\n>> and uh I mean I have this really\n>> this is a horrible experience um but I\nhad the same with AI though it's really\nnice I used the GitHub CLI did you is\nthat how you integrated with the with\n>> Yeah yeah yeah I have this like MCP\nsnippet where I just expose the the\nactions tool tool set because the MCP\n>> is too big\n>> is too big from GitHub.\n>> So this is where I do few shop samples,\nright? I I basically push my commit to\nthe PR the the workflows run and I I go\ninto a cloud code. I run the shell. I\nsay GitHub dash uh or GitHub PR check\nnumber three. And then it shows these\nare all the checks that run and these\nsucceeded. This how how much they took.\nThis is a job uh description or the link\nto the job ID. Um and then you just go\nuh GitHub CLI um PR or is it run view\nand then you can do either run id or or\nwith the argument flag d- job and you\njust pass that job from that PR check in\nthere. And when I first show to cloud\ncode I do these commands myself. So it\nsees the output and you can you can do\nd-lock failed and whatever. Then it\nstarted using jq to like you know JSON\noutputs to parse through things. Um, but\nit was I don't know. It did things that\nI thought wasn't really necessary. But I\ndon't need an MCP. I don't need\nanything. I'm just showing it the GitHub\nCLI command\n>> and then it just goes in a loop. It just\nlike, oh, I see it's failing here. Oh, I\nsee this problem.\n>> So, I'm in I'm in that team showing\nGitHub what to do. But like\n>> not repeatedly, not every time, all the\ntime.\n>> My my colleague my colleague asked u\na good question in a sense. is like he\nasked like what do I uh I need to use\nthe GitHub CLI what should I use the\nGitHub MCP\nor some other approach and then\nbasically I chimed in and said like well\nthe GitHub C MCP sucks because it's too\nverbose and it wastes your tokens but if\nyou use the GitHub um API or CLI sorry\nif you use the GH CLI you have to tell\nit how what to use. So my my colleague\nis a bit of a noob.\n>> I I think to be honest he wasn't he was\na little bit confused by what I was\nsaying like you have to teach\nuh GHLI you have to you have to teach\nthe the the\nbetter way is to teaching the AI how to\nuse the command. I mean that kind of\nblew his brain.\n>> Cloud skills are full right?\n>> I need Okay, then I need a skill to use\nthe GitHub CLI. That's a good\n[clears throat] weekend project. That's\na good weekend project.\n>> For sure there's one.\n>> For sure there's one.\n>> There's actually people that are writing\nLLM like agents to create skills and you\ngive it a couple of prompts of what it\ndoes and then it will explore the CLI\nand it will write an a like an agent\nskill which I think is a bit dumb right\nuh but like if it works it works. The\nwhole idea of the of cloud skills is\nprogressive disclosure. So you start\nwith like the first basic flows and then\nif you need more do this, if you need\nmore, do that. And then cloud is\nsupposed to like parse through it and\nand and progressively\nread more to like be able to do more.\nAnd and yes, that should be the way that\nyou don't always have to show how to use\na GH CLI every time, but you\n>> You're right. You're right. I should\nhave thought about that cuz I think my\ncolleague just was thinking I was an\nidiot or something like that. Like\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I need to I need Do do\nyou have you created any skills?\n>> No, I've only like played with the beats\nskill, right? But I don't like I\nintegrated it so it's living somewhere\nin my I think it's in your home\ndirectory.\n>> The the problem is in my world like I\nhave my personal claude code space which\nis fun but daytoday in my in my\nworkplace I'm using VS code and VS code\ndoesn't support skills. I believe\n>> they they have something in speckit they\nhave like they have a different way now\nto expose different agents sub agents\ninto your VS code as well when when I\nlook at the specit latest presentation\nfrom from the guy who who uh is like one\nof the main advocates on YouTube he\nshowed how they have like integrated\nspeckit into vs code settings like\ncopilotcopilot/s\nsettings.json JSON or something and they\nhave like declared all of the agents\nthat the specket provides. So then when\nyou are in the chat window of VS code\nyou can switch between these agents and\none of them is like the speckit plan\n>> better at VS code or something like\nthat.\n>> Look at the the speckit YouTube video\nchannel and then one of the latest\nvideos he shows how how they they are\nthey are exporting the LLM specket\nagents into VS code. So I think if you\ncan do that, you have dedicated agents,\nmaybe there's a way to like have the\nagent skills as well. Um cuz again like\nthey are constantly feeding off each\nother, right? One one company brings\nsomething out, another one copies it.\n>> Oh, sorry. I'm getting distracted. My\nwife is messaging me about the school\nrun.\nWhat time do you have to go back to work\nin 20 minutes or something?\n>> Yeah, something like that.\nYou said earlier something about um when\nyour colleague asked and teaching it how\nto use ah um I think that's where if you\nare a terminal like somebody who likes\nto live in the terminal tools like cloud\ncode kind of feels very cool because you\nare then you already are used to create\npull requests using gh right you already\ngo ghbrr create-fill\nwhatever u you push your branches from\nwith git so you're you're not someone\nthat goes to to the web and then clicks\non a button to create and so and so on.\nRight?\n>> So that's where I think that transfers\neasily into these other\n>> going back right back to what Steve Jo's\ntalk was about was that like he was\nsaying that the statistics in companies\nwhere people are adopting AI and they\nare are are by all measures uh becoming\nmore productive and then there's the\nsenior staff engineers who go who who\nwho there there people in a company who\nare not adopting it.\n>> So what do you do with those people who\nare not adopting it? And to be honest, I\nsee that in my workplace. It's like I'm\nusing AI like uh like like you, I\nsuppose, and I see the benefit, but\nthere's some there's there's there's\ndefinitely uh members of my team who are\njust completely not interested in in\npicking up these new workflows. I'm\nlike,\n>> so I had I I went to a Q Q&A conference\nback in June and one of I did I was\ninvited on the panel and one of the\naudience questions was exactly this like\nas a team lead because QA and and and\nand LLMs it's quite a big a big changing\nthere right automation of of LLM\ngenerating test cases and all sorry\nautomation of of tests and generating\ntest cases and test data um so one of\nthe the people there was like how can I\nhelp or ensure everyone within the team\num picks up on these LLMs um and and the\nreply from the the panel members and\nsome some somebody worked at Singapore\nAirlines and he says we we create a\nprompt database we do regular brown bags\nwe we um you know we share people with\ndifferent workflows on on how it helps\nuh but at the same time when you're\nsaying like there's these senior\nengineer who is really reluctant to to\npick us up I think maybe you need\nsomeone of those in your company, right?\nMaybe you need someone. Uh, and that\nthat makes me think of a Reddit post I\nsaw on the DevOps subreddit, I think\nthis week, which was like, I'm so\nfrustrated. Everyone in my team is using\nLLM and I'm like the only one that's\nactually doing manual reviews of all\nthese PRs and I'm reading all these PRs\nand I'm like the I feel like I'm the\nonly one like commenting on these lines\nof code and saying like why is this like\nthat and so on. So, so um\n>> but still I mean maybe yeah, I see your\npoint. There's definitely\ndefinitely like an argument to be made.\nOkay, here's another problem that I hit\nout of work, right, is that strictly\nspeaking, we have a co-pilot license\nand I think there's basically the JBT\nmodels exposed there,\n>> but I want to use I want to use Claude.\nSo, VS Code gives me an ability and to\npaste in an API key for uh Claude as\nwell as Google Gemini and all the other\nstuff.\n>> But then you then you have this\nconundrum like hm the company hasn't\nexpressly approved this model and that\nmodel.\n>> Can I use it?\n>> Yeah. And and then furthermore, there's\na whole uh topic around um the you know,\nwho's going to pay for this.\n>> Um\n>> I feel like these are unresolved issues,\nbut maybe maybe let's get back to I\nthink I think I need to do the school\nrun. It's it's it's icy out here. My\nwife doesn't want to drive in that in\nthe\n>> I need to take the kids to school. Okay.\nYeah. Um just on that point right for me\ncurrently\nI'm I'm using I'm this is I think if\nyou're in in infrastructure and DevOps\nI've always said these are to me are the\nmost interesting fields to be in because\nit's the same everywhere. It's not\nsecret sauce. It's not this the the the\nthe secret terraform everywhere.\n>> What do you mean?\n>> Yeah. I mean the ideas of running\ninfrastructure on the cloud and setting\nup uh you know observability dashboards\nand monitors and CI/CD pipelines it's\nnot a core differentiator or secret\nsauce of an organization it's not like\nsomething that's propri saying yeah\nright the skills are transferable\n>> exactly so I used to coach or work with\nproduct engineers and then try to\nconvince them like why do you you know\nbother with working purely on business\num um business feature uh tickets, user\nstories and so on. I isn't it way more\ninteresting to be in the DevOps space\nand then be like exposed to something\nthat's you much more transferable\nbetween organizations when you want to\nchange as well. Um but that was then\nuntil I got into a position where DevOps\nwas really seen as a cost center and\nthen you are like completely blocked to\ndo any type of refactoring because why\nwould you want to do this and and um you\nknow\n>> this sounds like my life right now to be\nhonest.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and I was always\nsuper happy to be DevOps. Uh but then\nyou have the ne negatives which are like\num you know unthankful because nobody\ncares everything's running. and people\nare wondering what is this guy doing\nuntil there's an outage and then\neveryone's you know breathing down your\nneck and why is it down [laughter] and\nthen uh I had a few companies where\nthere was like a celebrity uh but that\nwas a pretty dire state right because\nthe whole website was down and you\nmanaged to recover it within x amount of\ntime and then you're like\n>> this hero [laughter] this hero thing\nlike yeah you saved the day dude you got\nthe website back up maybe it shouldn't\nhave been down in the first place for\nChrist's sake\n>> yeah it depends also if you're the fire\nstarter right if you're the ones putting\nfires all the time that you are actually\nthe fire starter [laughter] but yeah\nyeah yeah um yeah it's that was\n>> industry isn't it\n>> so that's where I think using LLMs for\nDevOps related tasks is easier because\nit's like it's not so proprietary and a\nlot of the things I do I actually take\nan open source library and I I work on\nadding features there so I'm saying to\neveryone like hey don't I I this rule\ndoesn't apply to me because I'm taking\nan Apache 2 library I'm putting it as an\nopen source fork and all of my cloud\ncode generated code uh is not related to\nany company data. But but like do you\nthink like for example do you think\nGoogle uh trains\nthe Gemini model on their own\nproprietary uh code base? I I I think\nthere would be afraid that there would\nbe excilation of data, right? That I\nthink there's clear cases of of\n>> So basically like you so if you went to\nGemini say create me a Google search\nengine, they would it just wouldn't\n>> I'm pretty sure that there's a whole\n[snorts] like actors trying to\nexcfiltrate as much. I mean they all\nthey always say that Quen when it was\nlike trained and like how many% of the\ntotal cost that OpenAI and other\ncompanies spend quen AI from China was\ndeveloped with like a fraction of the\ncost and they say it's trained on\nsynthetic data. trained exfiltrated uh\nfrom all of the um you know open AI\nmodels and so on right so so there's\ndefinitely organizations trying to\nexcfiltrate any type of proprietary\ninformation from companies and I think\nGoogle must separate the training data\nfor\n>> but I don't think other companies have\nthat luxury I think that I think the um\nI mean\nokay\nobviously people are trying to keep\ntheir own proprietary source code um\nsafe and obviously their their private\nGitHub repos are not being indexed\nby um by a model. But nonetheless,\num,\nyou know, I'm sure if you ask a CTO of\nof a company with a big code base and\nthey and and you asked and you said to\nthem like, uh, would you like a model\nthat knows about your coding style and\nyour uh, and your existing code? They\nwould jump at it, right?\n>> Yeah, there's companies doing that,\nright?\n>> So, there's a bit of a a chasm there,\nlike how do you bridge that? So, so\nsource graph is had very has a a lot of\ninteresting YouTube videos because\nsource graph positioned themselves as\nthe originally enterprise solution for\ncode like search right so they have big\ncontracts with enterprises for you know\npropriety self-hosted deployments um to\nindex the code and for you know JP\nMorgan whatever huge clients to to for\ntheir software engineers to quickly find\num code or relevant um microservices for\ncertain functionality across all of the\ncode base right so [snorts] then they\nthey are also having their LLM on top of\nthis now like Annie I think it's called\nor uh\n>> okay so there there are products for\nthis okay\n>> yeah yeah um and and a lot of yeah when\nearlier\n>> I mean I mean GitHub GitHub needs to do\nthis next seriously I mean like\n>> so when we talked about I'm using VS\nCode and um and then I'm not sure which\nmodel I have access to I can give it an\nAPI key and what's the contract like\nwhen I talk to someone from GitHub he\nwas visiting in Vietnam. He told me that\nthey have very strict um contracts in\nplace with enterprises and how they are\nusing the code. And also when you sign\nwith with the with Microsoft and on the\nGitHub enterprise, you decide like\nfor example, one of the risks that\ncompanies have is that they get um a\nlawsuit for copying code, right? if they\nuse an AI, how can GitHub copilot\ndeployed across all of these people that\nare using the AI guarantee that I'm not\ngenerating code that is proprietary or\nthat is copyrighted and that's now in my\ncodebase. Like imagine it's a GPL and\nnow I have to open source everything. Um\nso so that's a risk. So so Microsoft has\nthese contracts in place that says first\noff it it sources different it generates\nsolutions\n>> mess up like what stops one of my team.\n>> Hold on. You haven't listened how they\nsolved it yet. So he told me that they\nare generating different code solutions\nand then they do a cross check to any\nlike existing and licensed code in their\ndatabase and then they're you know\nrejecting anything that could be and\nthen they're sending you only the one\nthat is passing all of that. Sometimes\nco-pilot gives you code and then\nsuddenly gets removed says like this is\na copyrighted code I can't give you that\n>> and then the second thing is what he\ntold me is that Microsoft actually will\nsponsor you in if there's a lawsuit if\nyou if you prove that this code is\ngenerated by co-pilot and Microsoft will\nbe part of the lawsuit that's why he\ntold me like part of the contract\nstipulates that if your company gets um\ngets what's it called um\n>> extra lawsuit yeah no gets a lawsuit\nagainst you like um then\n>> Oh, okay. Because you're using source\ncode that might be interpreted as being\nproprietary.\n>> Yeah. So, so basically you said it's\nvery hard but he was saying that's one\nof the things Microsoft has to convince\nenterprise users that they are\nprotecting. seems like a a good tact but\nbut I mean at the end of the day that's\nthat's Microsoft that's GitHub they they\nknow about your proprietary code but\nlike\n>> like how how about this scenario like\nthere's a new there's a new edit there's\na new IDE let's call it anti-gravity and\nsomeone like oh wow this can help me do\nmy job and then he just launches on his\nproprietary codebase and then all of a\nsudden\n>> so that's where Um it's it's important\nfor organizations to put in place AI\npolicies and and and books um what's it\ncalled? Runbooks or guides because if if\nthis happens, right, it means that the\nuser hasn't really been informed um or\nor [snorts] he's like maliciously doing\nit. He knows that it's not allowed but\nhe's going to do it or he's not know he\ndoesn't know about the risk and he just\ninstalls it and then he hasn't been\ntrained. Right? So, so in my\norganization we had um to sign a\ncontract that says that I will not copy\nproprietary and this is we had to first\nlearn what is propriety and confidential\ninformation. who like no be no no be uh\nno before trainings and then also sign a\ncontract saying like\n>> you know if they find out that I do this\nbut I'm not doing it [laughter]\n>> then I will be\n>> like one thing in in some workplaces\nthat I like to do is to encourage the\nuse of code spaces do you know GitHub\nGitHub code space\n>> yeah I haven't used it but yeah\n>> but the cool thing about that is that\nlike the code is there and it's not on\nyour local machine and it's there's a\nnice clear division And\nyeah, I'm just finding it hard like\nbecause\nlike yeah, like we we like I I we have a\nspecial API key with u with a particular\nvendor. I'm not going to say who, which\ngives us private confidentiality with\nthe code that we use on it. But then\nit's not clear if we have permission\nfrom the client if we can\nuse uh\n>> snippets of the like like to be honest\nI'm not even using\nthe code base right it's it's like what\nyou were saying with the Terraform it's\nlike uh I mean not Terraform like\ninfrastructures code it's like maybe I'm\ntrying to debug a GitHub workflow that's\nno different to anyone else's Terraform\nplan and apply and I would want to use\nthat that that paid for model and and\nand then I'm always a little bit like hm\nI'm not sure I can do this because\ntechnically what I've just copy and\npasted here is proprietary code but it\nisn't really and yeah all this ambiguity\nmakes makes the whole experience a\nlittle bit crappy\nright um but but I was going to say that\nyou are somebody that then worries about\nthat either because you've been trained\nor informed about these risks. Um so you\nknow that's because your company has put\nin place policies so that you are\nknowledgeable about these things right\nif if you look at many other people\n>> but the policies are not clear they they\njust create FUD you know what I mean\nlike and FUD is worse than\n>> fear uncertainty and doubt\n>> which is a crypto term like crypto\n>> I mean [sighs]\nhow many how many companies have really\nclear policies with AI like you can only\nuse this model and that model and that's\nit. I don't I don't think I've seen any\nI don't seen I don't think I've seen\nany.\n>> I think that's where your organization\nis providing you with access to AI and\nmy organization is giving us access to\nGitHub copilot. I I am naming it. Um but\num that also at the enterprise level the\norganization level they control which\nmodels the users have access to. In our\ncase, we can only select the ones that\nthat they have approved in our\norganization.\n>> Okay. In in code in VS Code basically,\nright?\n>> And I only know this I don't manage\nthis, but I know this because somebody\nin in the chat asked like, \"Hey, they\njust released Sun 4.5. We can only\naccess four. Can you give us access to\nthis new model and then somebody has to\ngo into it and then give access to it?\"\n>> You say that and I think it's I think\nwhat you're saying is true, but at the\nsame time, VS Code gives me the option\njust to paste in an API key. So like\n>> Yeah. I don't know like I'm not using\nthe VS code one and again I'm I'm\nexcusing my not using it by only working\non on repositories that are not private\n[laughter]\nand um and basically if I do something\num yeah anyway so so I don't know if I\ncan add the key but earlier you also say\nif you use VS code in the first place\nright um the guy who was working at\nMicrosoft was telling me that the plugin\nsystem at the time which is more than a\nyear ago had no control about like VS\nCode did not have any any constraints on\nwhat the plug-in could read. So a\nplug-in could just read anything from\nyour your your folder, right? And I\nthink they have improved that now\nbecause now whenever you install an\nextension, it tells you like, \"Watch\nout. Do you trust these people?\" And\nthat's all they did basically.\n>> Yeah. I mean, yeah. V extensions.\n>> Yeah. Like\n>> Yeah. I mean, that's a good that's a\ngood uh segue because, you know, people\ngo like, \"Oh, did you get approval to\nuse these model thing like that?\"\nThey're like, \"It's there. I mean, I\ndidn't uh you know, if they wanted to\nprohibit it, they Yeah, but you should\nget approval before you use anything.\nIt's like, how many extensions do you\nhave installed? You're like, how many\ntools do you have installed? Did you get\npermission for every one of those\nextensions or tools that you get have\ninstalled? I mean, you're being\nridiculous. So,\n>> and that's one of the things the\nMicrosoft guy told me as well. This is\nsomething that they as the uh copilot\nextension implementation uh provider he\nhe said it was actually GitHub acquired\nby Microsoft right he said that they\nguarantee that it will only read files\nthat you have open in the editor it will\nnot read anything from the disk so um\nthat's the type of guarantees that you\nlike I don't know that until he told me\nright it's probably somewhere in the\nfine print I don't know about the MD\ngravity right now uh from Google I just\ninstalled it I gave it the code base\nwhich is open source uh to work on and\nit probably read everything anyway and\nit must be able to because if it can't\nit wouldn't wouldn't have been able to\ndo such a good job to find exactly where\nit needed to change what right\n>> yeah\nwell okay I I wanted to end the the\nconversation on something a little bit\nmore positive but um I guess the\npositive thing is that the all these uh\nwe're living in a really exciting time\nreally I'm really digging the fact that\nI'm alive I mean it's amazing I mean\nlike the future's is is bonkers, isn't\nit? It's incredible.\n>> So, I agree absolutely with what you\njust said, but my second the second part\nabout the future is where I'm like, for\nhow long? [laughter]\nFor how long?\n>> I do feel I do feel this stuff for $20 a\nmonth.\n>> I'm probably like in\npositive. I'm I'm in that that maybe the\nplateau camp like I do feel like we are\nhitting a surge cuz some people say like\noh this thing is just going to go like\nthis like like like forever and I'm like\nI think the models are improving but not\nas fast as you would think cuz the\nmodels I I feel have a limited training\nsupply right they're not they're not\ngoing to invent new information that\nit's going to plateau essentially by how\nmuch good stuff there is for it to be\ntrained on, right?\n>> If it's like software,\num\nwhere it's just an ever expanding gas,\nit takes up whatever resources are\navailable. Um I think with with AI right\nnow, it's taking up every resource it\ncan in terms of electricity and power\nand um you know, GPU capacity. Um, it's\nvery hard to predict because\nbefore the release of Gemini 3 this\nweek, everyone was like, \"What happened\nto Google? Gemini 2.5 Pro, me included,\nin March was great. Now, what's what\nreally have to like be really good? Is\nit delay?\" Because is there a disarray?\nThere was so many articles about cuz I\nsearched Gemini 3.0 release pretty much\nevery day to find out if there was any\nnews and every article you're like,\n\"When is the next?\"\n>> Yeah. because I had to get things done\nby Wednesday and I was like hoping\nGemini 2.3 zero release I get some free\ncredits.\n>> Your claw tokens or your claw budget was\nalmost expired.\n>> Every article I read before Wednesday\nwas like\n>> the truth and the disarray within\nGoogle. Google is completely unable to\nhandle it. Google has lost has lost it.\nYou know what is about these TPUs?\nthere's a TPU supposedly rolled out and\ngive them the edge across the world but\nthe infrastructure is delayed that's why\nGemini 3 is delayed and blah blah blah\nbut then Gemini came out and everyone's\nlike Google did it Google is the market\nleader look at at um how Google Gemini\n3.0 zero is like this high in the\nbenchmarks. Does that give like um what\nthey called it again? Because you have a\nmuch small smarter model within your\norganization and you have full access to\nit. That means that you have the ability\nto accelerate much faster than the other\ncompanies, right? So with the\nannouncement of Gemini 3 and in how good\nit is compared to GPT 5.1 and 74.5 that\ngives them not just like a small edge\nthat gives them a massive edge because\nit means internally they can have like a\nhundreds of Gemini trees running and\nimproving on the product.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean like I definitely\nfelt that uh maybe as long as a year ago\nthat that all of a sudden like Google\nSheets and uh Google Docs basically got\na whole bunch of new features and like\nprevious 5 years\nGoogle Docs and the Google Suite felt\nfrankly unmaintained. And I was thinking\nto myself like why all of a sudden is\nthere so many cool new features\n>> after they lay off 30,000 people or\nsomething. [laughter] Why suddenly\nGoogle Sheets have all these new\nfeatures? H\n>> well okay there could be other\nmitigating factors but I did I did I did\nbasically occur to me that like maybe\nthey have some technology that we don't\nhave or something or or do you think\nit's the fact that they laid off people?\n>> No. No, no, no. I was just correlating\nwith the fact that they laid off people\nand and so it must be llams or\nsomething, right? How can you suddenly\nhave a whole bunch of new kettle of fish\n>> after you lay off all these people?\n>> Yeah, let's let's get back to that. I I\nthink I've got to wind this up. Anyway,\nit's been it was a great chat. I'll\nupload it. I'll share the link and I ask\neveryone to\nplease like and subscribe and share the\npodcast.\n>> And and and and comment below like if we\nsaid something stupid or something\nbetter if we could have said something\nbetter or then let let us know that\n>> this comment will be Google did not lay\noff 30,000 people. It was more like\n100,000 people.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. We're hoping to get in intelligent\ncomments. To be honest, the comments\nsection is always not as good as I hoped\nit to be. All right.\nSo, you're instigating right now.\n>> I wouldn't I wouldn't take it.\n>> I speak the truth only.\n>> I wouldn't I wouldn't take it.\n>> Okay. See you. See you, Vincent. Bye.",

What do\n[0:12] you think of the Gemini 3 Pro thing?\n[0:15] Have you managed to get on it?\n[0:19] >> Um I'm using anti-gravity and I got some\n[0:22] Gemini 3 Pro for free, so obviously my\n[0:25] limits are pretty bad. Um, and it has\n[0:30] been I mean I started I'm like a day I'm\n[0:35] shifted in in like 12 hours compared to\n[0:37] when they announced it, right? But that\n[0:39] also means that I'm online when most\n[0:41] Americans that try it out are offline.\n[0:43] So I I have to fight with other\n[0:46] Southeast Asianbased people which not\n[0:49] everyone is following the latest Gemini\n[0:51] tree release. So the first day I had a\n[0:56] decent amount of work done by Gemini 3.\n[0:59] It was pretty good. The experience in\n[1:01] anti-gravity was also pretty nice. It\n[1:03] gives you a couple of new like things\n[1:05] reviewing files. I haven't used cursor\n[1:07] so I wasn't too familiar with like a\n[1:09] proper IDE integration. I've given up on\n[1:12] Visual Studio Code Copilot for a while\n[1:14] already. I'm purely in CLI land. So\n[1:18] using an IDE and you know it's it's\n[1:21] [snorts] been a long time before the LM\n[1:23] was like rewriting the whole file and\n[1:24] you had to watch it rewrite and you go\n[1:26] like no don't change that. Ah and now\n[1:29] it's it just instantly pops up with like\n[1:31] um this has changed this has changed you\n[1:34] can review this file. So it's pretty\n[1:36] pretty cool. Yeah\n[1:37] >> because um I don't know if you saw that\n[1:38] link I sent you yesterday to some AR AI\n[1:41] summit with Steve Jger and uh\n[1:44] >> it was it was live right? I I didn't\n[1:46] watch it live\n[1:47] >> because I like to fast forward and so\n[1:49] on. So,\n[1:50] >> well, I I just someone shared the link\n[1:52] and I just tapped on it and like Steve\n[1:53] Jger was giving his uh his his spiel\n[1:57] live and uh it was pretty good. It\n[2:01] >> It was a pretty good\n[2:03] >> I definitely want to see that now. You\n[2:05] told me that he's talking about it. I\n[2:06] see a lot of improvements on the\n[2:08] >> but like one of his like he says like,\n[2:10] \"Oh, I needed to give a hot take and\n[2:11] here's my hot take. You're a bad\n[2:13] engineer if you use an IDE by the end of\n[2:16] the year. Thought\n[2:17] >> by the end of the year. Oh, that's a hot\n[2:18] take.\n[2:19] >> Interesting.\n[2:21] >> Like but like an IDE.\n[2:23] >> Is he sponsored by Warp now? [laughter]\n[2:25] >> Well, the thing is the AI summit was\n[2:27] like sponsored by I think Google and\n[2:29] Google was like anti-gravity this,\n[2:31] anti-gravity that. So I thought it was a\n[2:34] little bit rude of him to to basically\n[2:36] drop a bombshell. Don't use an IDE. But\n[2:38] like I think it perhaps what he's trying\n[2:40] to say is that you you don't need to\n[2:42] edit code. You don't need to edit code.\n[2:46] >> Yeah. Because you definitely want to see\n[2:47] those diffs and and and to be honest\n[2:50] even cloud code is integrated within\n[2:52] Visual Studio Code or whatever IDE you\n[2:53] run it. Every other ID is a V VS code\n[2:57] fork anyway.\n[2:59] >> Um so so it it's really nicely\n[3:01] integrated like it opens up the de for\n[3:03] you. You can clearly see it. those\n[3:05] things still need a proper and and what\n[3:08] anti-gravity does really well is and I'm\n[3:11] still learning but it gives you like a\n[3:12] proposal and I was like great like I\n[3:16] don't see where I need to click but then\n[3:17] there was a small button at the top\n[3:18] which is like review and then you can\n[3:20] like highlight which they show I've seen\n[3:22] on the product demo and you can\n[3:23] highlight like here it made an\n[3:25] assumption I say well this is a wrong\n[3:26] assumption and then I feed back the it's\n[3:29] like a PR review you can just highlight\n[3:31] different sections and put a comment on\n[3:32] that\n[3:33] >> it's like a different take on that whole\n[3:35] plan mode include cuz I really like plan\n[3:37] mode in the sense that it's like\n[3:38] prompting you this this that like making\n[3:41] >> now it's new right now now when it's\n[3:43] planning it goes like I have a couple of\n[3:44] clarify questions and it it asks those\n[3:46] questions to you which is something that\n[3:48] speckit also did and now they kind of\n[3:50] build it into cloud code like it goes it\n[3:52] goes off into a planning agent which is\n[3:54] running Sony 4.5 goes through your code\n[3:57] with the requirements and comes back\n[3:59] with like a plan and some clarifications\n[4:00] and it asks you like I have five\n[4:02] clarifying questions and then you answer\n[4:03] them and you submit it and then comes up\n[4:05] with a plan which is a very nice uh\n[4:08] experience.\n[4:09] >> Yeah. I mean I'm more CLI gang because I\n[4:12] feel like you know moving between the\n[4:14] keyboard moving like ABC like I can be a\n[4:16] little bit faster cuz the ide can be a\n[4:18] bit clumsy but it's it feels like we're\n[4:21] always going to go back we it feels like\n[4:24] we're going we're in this golden age\n[4:25] where it's like terminal claw code. it's\n[4:28] probably going to last a few more months\n[4:29] and then then they all go back to some\n[4:31] IDE uh you know noob land or something\n[4:34] like that\n[4:34] >> if they can address I guess the heart\n[4:36] like the problems that people have with\n[4:38] IDs I know a friend of mine really likes\n[4:40] cursor and he swears by cursor it's\n[4:42] mostly front end maybe that's why I\n[4:44] don't know u but like another thing that\n[4:47] I really like when you were saying about\n[4:49] curs um cloud code um terminal based\n[4:53] view Gemini CLI did a big upgrade on\n[4:56] their terminal all um you can do Ctrl S\n[5:00] now to go into selection mode and select\n[5:01] things and copy paste them and the\n[5:04] scroll experience they say we fixed the\n[5:06] flickering like you know cloud code\n[5:07] starts to disco um Gemini CLI has this\n[5:11] new way of of scrolling I found it slow\n[5:14] my machine is not slow but when I was\n[5:16] scrolling it was sometimes a bit laggy\n[5:18] but if it fixes some of the like\n[5:20] scrolling problems because if you're\n[5:22] reading an LLM and it puts out a message\n[5:24] and it scrolls all the way back down and\n[5:26] you have to go back to where you were to\n[5:27] like the thinking. It's so annoying.\n[5:30] >> These little things are like so\n[5:31] important, aren't they? Like that.\n[5:34] >> Well, Gemini is doing a good like I used\n[5:36] it two weeks ago. It was horrible. I\n[5:37] posted it. It was on LinkedIn and I was\n[5:39] like that was a horrible experience.\n[5:40] >> We were living in a golden age where\n[5:41] like this this competition between\n[5:45] Gemini and Claude. I don't know where I\n[5:47] I I did use codeex the other day, but\n[5:49] like I was I was flabbergasted because\n[5:51] codeex doesn't have like support for\n[5:54] project based configuration and things\n[5:57] like this.\n[5:58] >> Yeah. No, you Yeah, you want the prompt.\n[6:00] >> I mean, how easy is that a feature to\n[6:02] implement? Like\n[6:03] >> horrible.\n[6:04] >> And you don't have a shell also like you\n[6:06] can't exclamation mark. And I've tried\n[6:08] to search how do I run terminal shell\n[6:11] commands in inside codeex and it's like\n[6:13] you can't um which is\n[6:16] >> Codex is basically off the map at this\n[6:19] point. I mean what?\n[6:20] >> Yeah. Which is but then OpenAI says okay\n[6:22] we give Codex uh JGBD 5.1 CEX Pro to\n[6:26] everyone. Right after Gemini was\n[6:28] announced Gemini 3. They go like hey\n[6:30] everyone access to this now. [laughter]\n[6:32] >> But I mean I don't really see the value\n[6:35] in I mean I'm a clawed 4.5 gang still.\n[6:40] I don't I don't get anything out of uh\n[6:42] open AI because like that that's the\n[6:44] trouble like people I think a couple of\n[6:47] chats ago you were saying that you you\n[6:49] put on auto but I'm I'm now thinking\n[6:52] like no I need claw 4.5 or or this is\n[6:55] not going to work\n[6:57] >> auto\n[6:58] um like you you let it like auto approve\n[7:00] and\n[7:01] >> well auto choose the models like I'm\n[7:03] choose I want to choose the model\n[7:05] >> yeah I also change um for Gemini CLI\n[7:08] definitely I don't want it to go into\n[7:09] flash. So, I don't choose it to I don't\n[7:11] let it choose. I I think that's mainly\n[7:14] why I was having so many frustrations\n[7:15] with Gemini CI because they were going\n[7:17] into Flash.\n[7:18] >> So, I mean like would you like if you\n[7:21] were ranking the models, would you say\n[7:22] Claude is still top or would you say\n[7:24] Gemini is three 3 is now Eclipse?\n[7:26] >> It's very hard to to say because my\n[7:28] access to Gemini 3 has been quite\n[7:30] limited. Like I said, um I haven't tried\n[7:33] it in preview mode on on the paid\n[7:35] subscription of Gemini CLI. I'm using it\n[7:37] in anti-gravity free. So, um\n[7:40] >> I think I think you can assume you got\n[7:42] the you got the uh tasty experience\n[7:44] there.\n[7:45] >> Yeah, I did some really cool stuff. Um\n[7:48] but again, like I don't I'm not doing\n[7:49] benchmarks cuz I find this is the\n[7:51] hardest thing for me to make an opinion\n[7:53] about these things is I I Okay, so\n[7:56] basically what happened to me this week\n[7:58] was\n[7:59] >> benchmarks are always like weirdly weird\n[8:01] and manipulated. I think I think it it\n[8:04] is that to go on fields basically.\n[8:08] >> I don't think so because it's so hard to\n[8:11] to basically I saw some Reddit posts and\n[8:14] people were like I gave all three models\n[8:16] the same prompt. This is how how they\n[8:18] fared. I think that's a valid thing but\n[8:20] I don't have time for that because like\n[8:23] what happened to me was I I promised to\n[8:25] get something deployed um by this by\n[8:28] today like two hours ago. uh supposed to\n[8:31] finish it and I started on Monday and\n[8:35] then I realized I kind of underestimated\n[8:38] it as usual as all software engineers do\n[8:40] all the time [laughter]\n[8:42] and maybe maybe not all just me then I\n[8:44] guess um but\n[8:46] >> I get it wrong.\n[8:48] >> Yeah. So, so then what happened is I I\n[8:52] had to get things done and I was like\n[8:55] watch watching my weekly budget on\n[8:57] entropic carefully because I cannot run\n[9:01] out of tokens when I wanted to send it\n[9:03] off.\n[9:04] >> It's like a drug, isn't it? It's like,\n[9:05] oh, I check my supply. Yeah, I I kind of\n[9:08] choose what jobs I what I I will do\n[9:10] myself and like I don't let the model do\n[9:12] some stuff. But if I wanted to do like a\n[9:14] heavy troubleshoot going across a 100\n[9:15] files, I'd let the model do that, right?\n[9:18] Uh it's going to be a lot faster than me\n[9:19] trying to do it. If I have to rename a\n[9:21] couple of files and and and and do\n[9:23] things like that, I'm not going to say,\n[9:23] \"Yeah, go ahead and go do that and\n[9:25] waste, you know, a million tokens\n[9:27] renaming files or or or you know,\n[9:30] reading a whole file and then outputting\n[9:31] the same file into a new directory.\"\n[9:34] That's ridiculous. Yeah. So anyway, I\n[9:36] was kind of hitting close to the limits\n[9:39] by by Wednesday and there was all this\n[9:41] speculation about like Gemini coming\n[9:43] out, these batting screenshots getting\n[9:46] shared. It was pretty cool to and funny\n[9:48] to see all of that, but I was like\n[9:49] betting on it that it come out and then\n[9:51] I have access to a free LLM on top of\n[9:54] everything.\n[9:55] >> And so\n[9:56] >> the moment it came out, I literally have\n[9:58] like oh and I also have the cloud code\n[10:01] web version and I thought what you know\n[10:03] I never tried it. I have $250 credits\n[10:05] there. Uh, and I thought given the API\n[10:08] calls a day for me, easily around $100.\n[10:11] >> So, you have a different credit set for\n[10:13] the different\n[10:14] >> Yeah. So, so with Entropic subscription,\n[10:17] you you get your cloud code access, but\n[10:20] then they give everyone that has a\n[10:21] subscription, depending on their tier, a\n[10:23] number of credits. So, like if you're in\n[10:24] a prom max 200, whatever, you got like\n[10:26] $1,000 to try out their web interface.\n[10:30] So, you can go to cloud.ai/codes AI/ uh\n[10:33] code and it's a web version of cloud\n[10:34] code. So you don't have all of your\n[10:36] CLIs, you don't have like your\n[10:37] credentials, everything there. It just\n[10:39] have access to your git repo and it can\n[10:41] do some tasks. And I was like, I I want\n[10:44] to try out a new um interface like a\n[10:47] React library of components. Uh and I\n[10:50] was like, you don't need any tools for\n[10:51] that. So I have $250 credits there.\n[10:54] Given the amount of credits I spend a\n[10:56] day, $100, I think in three days, um I\n[10:58] will be able to spend $250. I I again I\n[11:02] thought that this was going to be like\n[11:04] API because the API is charged very\n[11:06] heavily whereas you pay $20 a month but\n[11:09] it telling me that I'm using over like\n[11:11] $600 of API calls. That's how the tool\n[11:14] tracks my calls and says this is how\n[11:16] many you are actually spending if you\n[11:17] were actually paying for every API call.\n[11:20] So So yeah. So so 250 I thought was\n[11:23] going to be over in a minute, right? And\n[11:25] it literally spent $8 only and it\n[11:28] finished. Why? Why is it because is it\n[11:31] because the web one is more efficient?\n[11:34] >> I don't know. Maybe it's because it's I\n[11:36] don't I I have no idea why the web was\n[11:37] so efficient.\n[11:38] >> So, are you are you on the max plan or\n[11:40] the pro plan?\n[11:41] >> I'm on the pro. I pray $20 a month. I I\n[11:43] I'm I'm diversifying, right? I have put\n[11:46] $20 in OpenAI, $20 in, and $20. And just\n[11:51] to reiterate what you were saying, so\n[11:52] you have you're on like a weekly limit\n[11:54] by the sounds of things for the\n[11:56] >> pretty much every provider gives you um\n[11:59] a 5 hour session token budget and then a\n[12:01] weekly token budget. Before they only\n[12:03] gave you 5 hours session token budget\n[12:05] and then people were running it and\n[12:06] sharing keys and they were just\n[12:07] maximizing it um by by having pools of\n[12:10] keys and so now they put uh like weekly\n[12:12] budget um which basically equates to\n[12:15] about 10 sessions that you 10 5 hour\n[12:18] sessions.\n[12:19] Besides like you know tracking your your\n[12:22] tokens and your credits, have you been\n[12:25] trying to make your your prompts more\n[12:29] tur? I mean I think we I think we agreed\n[12:32] that that MCP sucks. So\n[12:36] >> yeah,\n[12:37] >> have you dropped you you don't use any\n[12:38] MCP servers?\n[12:40] >> I I just run MCTP on my cloud\n[12:42] coordinates has zero MCPs connected.\n[12:45] Maybe it's because you just updated.\n[12:47] >> What other token optimizations have you\n[12:50] been making?\n[12:51] >> Okay, so\n[12:53] I find these prompts are so difficult to\n[12:56] get right unless you are running an eval\n[12:59] suite that evaluates your use cases to\n[13:01] to make sure that the prompts still work\n[13:02] with the model and all that. I I I don't\n[13:06] want to write them myself. I don't want\n[13:07] to maintain them myself. So I'm using\n[13:10] spec kit and I've customized it a tiny\n[13:13] bit. I removed anything that says you're\n[13:15] gonna write out everything uh into a\n[13:17] different markdown file. I'm gonna make\n[13:18] sure that you use uh beats Steve's thing\n[13:21] to do the the issues, right?\n[13:22] >> Be kit and and Steve.\n[13:25] >> Yeah. And and it's going all right. I've\n[13:27] tested it out. I I started recording. I\n[13:30] say this every time we talk like I have\n[13:31] got a recording, but it's like I'm still\n[13:33] not happy with it. [laughter]\n[13:35] Um but yeah, it's going all right.\n[13:38] >> Oh, by the way, can you can you take\n[13:39] take the framing out? It auto frames\n[13:41] your your face all the time.\n[13:44] >> I don't know how to do that. Uh it's\n[13:46] >> Are you Are you on me last time?\n[13:49] >> I think I think it's called center\n[13:50] stage. You just click the green icon and\n[13:53] you turn off center stage.\n[13:55] >> Uh it's on Zoom.\n[13:57] >> I'm not too sure. I think it's I think\n[13:58] it's a a Mac feature actually.\n[14:04] >> But where do I disable it then? Because\n[14:05] I'm on a Zoom call. [snorts]\n[14:07] >> Yeah. Well, in in my in my in my Mac OS\n[14:11] machine, I have this green icon when\n[14:12] when it's like showing the usage of the\n[14:15] >> and then [snorts] you just click the\n[14:16] green icon and\n[14:17] >> enter stage.\n[14:19] >> Oh, it was not on.\n[14:22] >> Now it's Now it's off. Now it's on.\n[14:26] >> Okay, there's something.\n[14:29] >> Maybe. Okay, maybe go video settings. I\n[14:32] It's probably in video settings\n[14:35] and zoom then. Yeah, it's zoom. Of\n[14:38] course.\n[14:38] >> Zoom doom doom.\n[14:41] >> Video settings.\n[14:42] >> Yeah. Autoframing. New. Turn that off.\n[14:47] >> Video settings.\n[14:51] Virtual background appearance.\n[14:53] >> It's It's an appearance.\n[14:56] >> Autoframing. Oh,\n[14:59] okay. It's off. Wait. My video is off\n[15:01] too now.\n[15:03] >> Okay. It stops, right? Hopefully.\n[15:08] >> Yes.\n[15:09] >> Okay. But you were saying do you like\n[15:11] how do you keep your prompts st\n[15:14] your token usage down\n[15:16] >> cuz like I'm like for example when I'm\n[15:18] working with\n[15:20] >> uh Claude\n[15:22] I need to give quite a lot of context\n[15:24] cuz I'm working on a huge code base to\n[15:26] be honest and like I'm never too sure if\n[15:29] it's like looking through my git logs.\n[15:32] Um, I I know it kind of shows the\n[15:34] thinking, but I'm like it doesn't like\n[15:36] every stage when it does the thinking,\n[15:39] uh, it doesn't really give a good\n[15:40] feedback about how many tokens it's used\n[15:42] or what it's actually consumed. So I so,\n[15:47] so I'm always in this like gray zone of\n[15:49] like am I using my tokens efficiently or\n[15:52] not? But\n[15:53] >> so there is this\n[15:54] >> Yeah,\n[15:55] >> there's this one person ship hu I think\n[15:58] she wrote a book about AI cookbook or\n[16:00] something. She posted on LinkedIn a\n[16:02] script that parses through your cloud\n[16:04] locks, like your cloud code locks\n[16:06] because, so this is interesting. When\n[16:08] you run cloud code, it stores all of\n[16:10] your conversations on JSON files in\n[16:12] somewhere home directory or somewhere,\n[16:14] right? Including every single\n[16:16] screenshot. So if you take a screenshot\n[16:17] and you paste it, that gets checked some\n[16:19] u uh what's it called? Uh B 64 encoded\n[16:23] and written down into this JSON file. So\n[16:27] they she said no not she some people\n[16:29] said that there were like gigabytes of\n[16:32] of of logs in there but maybe if you're\n[16:35] really curious about your token usage\n[16:37] you could try and she posted a script\n[16:40] that she did to parse it and it\n[16:43] basically in her case she wanted to look\n[16:45] at how many times does um a tool use or\n[16:48] a command fail for example it tries to\n[16:50] read the file and says I can't find it\n[16:52] oh I'm in the wrong directory I need to\n[16:53] go up a directory and so on right and\n[16:55] she says is like she analyzed how many\n[16:57] times which commands failed and then she\n[17:00] updated her cloud autom to like specify\n[17:02] like if like focus on this focus on this\n[17:05] >> there's definitely like people who are\n[17:07] starting AI consultancies right now and\n[17:09] I can't help but think that would be\n[17:10] like a key tool some key tooling in your\n[17:14] AI consultancy like you would you you\n[17:16] know if you're trying to upskill a team\n[17:19] you would want these logs or you would\n[17:21] want to run your your tool over those\n[17:24] logs\n[17:26] to better uh train to make people better\n[17:30] at using the AI.\n[17:32] >> So I think this is a very good\n[17:34] observation that the fact that as an\n[17:37] engineer we must know how to use these\n[17:38] tools. Using these tools is not easy.\n[17:40] they changes so fast. Um, and there's a\n[17:45] lot of\n[17:48] AI slop being generated as solutions\n[17:52] around these tools.\n[17:53] >> Like the the signal the signal and noise\n[17:57] is pretty intense.\n[17:59] >> Actually, come to think of which which\n[18:01] Reddit are you on? because I I posted\n[18:02] like a genuine AI question on the VS\n[18:05] Code Reddit and everyone was replying to\n[18:08] me like I was like they didn't even\n[18:10] understand what I was saying.\n[18:12] >> The VS Code doesn't sound like somewhere\n[18:14] you would get I I'm usually on the\n[18:16] entropic um on the LLM devs. There's so\n[18:21] many. I I have no idea. Like sometimes\n[18:22] and but Reddit also suggests posts that\n[18:25] do not belong to any subreddit that\n[18:27] you're subscribed to, but because you\n[18:28] visited one Reddit, it will sub um it\n[18:31] will suggest these post because they're\n[18:32] similar to what you normally look at. So\n[18:35] >> usually if I see something nice, I I\n[18:37] subscribe to that uh subreddit and it's\n[18:39] like cloud code, cloud dev, llmdev. So I\n[18:44] like a whole list over time.\n[18:46] But but Reddit as as a platform seems to\n[18:49] be the the best one for you still.\n[18:51] You're not in you're not one of these\n[18:53] discord disco bunnies. Nitro\n[18:57] >> course is a bit like slack where you you\n[18:59] can have like a thousand slacks\n[19:00] connected and you don't remember. You\n[19:02] don't know what\n[19:03] >> so busy so noisy.\n[19:05] >> Also I have like agents of AI uh AI\n[19:09] agents AI agents AI gamedev AI prompt\n[19:13] programming.\n[19:15] So you you just hop between them and\n[19:18] just just try to I mean\n[19:20] >> it's on my front feet usually sl\n[19:22] artificial\n[19:23] artificial intelligence.\n[19:24] >> The other person I the other person I\n[19:26] like to follow is is Simon Willis. Do\n[19:29] you ever like check out his blogs? I\n[19:31] mean he blogs about AI like three times\n[19:33] a day almost.\n[19:34] >> You shared it with me, didn't you? You\n[19:36] share me a blog post of him.\n[19:37] >> Yeah, I like I like his work a lot. He\n[19:41] and the thing that blew me away about\n[19:43] the Gemini 3 release is that he was\n[19:45] talks he he has his like own unofficial\n[19:47] or official test of drawing a pelican on\n[19:51] a bicycle and the Gemini 3 did actually\n[19:54] a really good job compared to all the\n[19:55] other ones. [snorts]\n[19:57] >> There's also Chpt Coding and Chpt Pro\n[20:01] just I thought those and yeah and Cloud\n[20:03] AI cloud cloud code.\n[20:04] >> So you're in like 20 Reddits. Oh my god.\n[20:07] You're you're living. You're you're\n[20:08] you're deep diving, man.\n[20:10] >> No, I'm only listing the AI related\n[20:12] ones. Not [laughter] the other one. Not\n[20:15] the one.\n[20:19] >> Cursed AI. Oh, no. Not Not that one. Not\n[20:22] cursed.\n[20:25] >> What about all the Don't you have any\n[20:26] other interests like uh kite surfing or\n[20:29] whatever the thing?\n[20:30] >> I'm not listing those.\n[20:32] Um,\n[20:33] >> I did did you see that thing on hacker\n[20:35] news about\n[20:36] uh Europe relaxing their GDPR rules\n[20:39] around uh AI? And um when I looked into\n[20:43] the comments, most most people sort of\n[20:46] interpreted this as a victory for\n[20:47] cookies. So we don't have cookie banners\n[20:50] anymore in Europe. It's funny, right? Uh\n[20:53] this whole cookie thing. But but coming\n[20:55] back to the the the Simon Willis uh test\n[20:58] of asking you to draw a pelican on a\n[21:00] bike. Um we were talking earlier about\n[21:03] like benchmarks that that people run and\n[21:07] I think that's a type of benchmark right\n[21:09] that's that's interesting that other\n[21:10] people um you know evaluate a model\n[21:13] against um there was something\n[21:18] uh I forgot because\n[21:21] yeah usually I also just go off of like\n[21:23] what other people say about like I've\n[21:26] given if this test definitely if they\n[21:28] are providing like receipts right if\n[21:29] they're saying here's is a repo. Here's\n[21:31] the assignment. Here's how they did.\n[21:34] This is what I saw. And then also if\n[21:36] it's not like overexaggerated and\n[21:38] repeated cuz then it's like clearly AI\n[21:40] generated and it's so painful to read\n[21:42] through because it just repeats itself\n[21:44] and you're like, \"Oh my god, can you\n[21:45] just get to the point?\"\n[21:46] >> That's actually a good telltale sign of\n[21:49] AI. Sometimes it repeats, doesn't it?\n[21:52] So, that's funny because a lot of\n[21:54] subreddits um immediately ban a post if\n[21:57] it has too many emojis cuz it's like\n[21:59] classic AI to generate emojis or m\n[22:02] dashes and things like that.\n[22:03] >> So, um yeah.\n[22:04] >> Yeah.\n[22:05] When I'm using Claude, I I I get it I\n[22:08] get it to give me the solution and then\n[22:10] when I validate it's working and then I\n[22:12] feel like I have to go through this\n[22:15] uh step or stage or phase where where\n[22:18] I'm basically saying less code, suck\n[22:21] less,\n[22:22] make it more tight\n[22:25] because it's\n[22:25] >> Yeah. So it's pretty verbose by default.\n[22:30] So with the crunch that I'm under for\n[22:33] delivering something right now, I have\n[22:35] and you were saying earlier you have a\n[22:37] really large code base and and you then\n[22:39] went on to say that it's very hard to\n[22:41] control how much token it's using and so\n[22:43] on. But when we go back to the very\n[22:45] large core bait part um when you said\n[22:49] one of the issues I have I I just give\n[22:51] it like a really big like seven-year-old\n[22:54] Golang monor repo that I adopted like\n[22:56] forked and added my own features on top\n[22:58] and usually hacked them in. So, it's\n[23:00] super messy code and I'm always like a\n[23:02] little bit, you know, reluctant or I\n[23:05] always try to just find the different\n[23:07] paths. I kind of know the codebase where\n[23:09] it needs to go and change things and I\n[23:11] was like, I don't know. I'm going to do\n[23:12] this myself. But then I tried\n[23:14] anti-gravity Gemini tree. It's a really\n[23:16] light 7-year-old codebase and it pretty\n[23:20] it was I didn't have to give it anything\n[23:22] like I didn't have an agent. MD or\n[23:24] anything like that and I said like look\n[23:26] I I'm adding a new CLI. So the root\n[23:28] right now main.go is at the root but we\n[23:30] need to move it refactor it so that the\n[23:32] the CLI are separate directory so we can\n[23:34] mint or build the different binaries\n[23:35] from it and and then we need to like\n[23:38] have a shared interface between those\n[23:40] two binaries because one will write\n[23:41] files on this the other one reads it. So\n[23:44] um where like I suggest we put it here\n[23:46] there I went a bit back and forth with\n[23:48] HGBT on the web actually while in the\n[23:50] gym which is pretty cool. You can just\n[23:51] talk and then you know brainstorm and\n[23:53] then I took the prompt gave it to the\n[23:54] anti-gravity and it did an amazing job.\n[23:57] It did a really good job. And in terms\n[23:59] of code, the test suite on that repo is\n[24:02] quite extensive. I went in, I wrote my\n[24:04] own tests in the in that one area. So,\n[24:06] it's kind of like a golden.\n[24:07] >> How do you write your test your in Go\n[24:09] tests or what?\n[24:11] >> Yeah. Um,\n[24:13] it's funny because when I first started\n[24:15] working with this repository, I was very\n[24:17] surprised by their test approach. They\n[24:18] have like this golden files approach\n[24:20] which is kind of very more popular now\n[24:22] as snapshot testing when they just\n[24:25] >> Oh, yeah. Um, Hashimoto talked about\n[24:27] that.\n[24:28] >> I think you shared me a post or or it\n[24:30] was on Reddit.\n[24:31] >> Hashimoto did a did a call did a talk\n[24:34] back in 2007 of how they wrote no 2017\n[24:38] of how they wrote Terraform and how they\n[24:40] wrote wrote their test suites and he did\n[24:41] different testing mechanisms and then I\n[24:44] saw he did a newer one uh\n[24:46] >> it was linked in the same YouTube video.\n[24:48] So I I I looked at the new one as well.\n[24:50] Very interesting. But that's how the\n[24:52] tests were written. So they were all\n[24:53] golden tests there. It's a directory\n[24:55] with all the poss like different\n[24:56] scenarios of of the config file, which\n[24:58] is ugly YL. I hate Yaml, but anyway,\n[25:00] it's a like I said, seven-year-old\n[25:01] thing. It uses a YAML file as an input\n[25:03] file. So, I just added a couple new\n[25:05] fields in the config, and then I\n[25:07] activated those fields in the test uh in\n[25:09] the test data. I ran the generate all\n[25:12] the golden files. I reviewed it if it\n[25:13] makes sense. And then I just let uh\n[25:16] Gemini and the LLM do its thing. No\n[25:19] matter like the code I I saw like\n[25:20] there's a whole bunch of lines there and\n[25:22] it's like duplicated and I committed\n[25:24] everything and I said like hey can we\n[25:26] look at this and clean this up and it\n[25:27] says done it's cleaned up. I ran the\n[25:29] golden test fail error. I was like okay\n[25:31] there's something wrong because you\n[25:33] duplicate like all of these additional\n[25:35] lines are here that shouldn't be there\n[25:36] and then the LLM says oh yeah my\n[25:38] refactor did not take into account this\n[25:40] edge case and that add case. And I just\n[25:41] went like revert everything. I stick to\n[25:44] the commit. I [laughter] don't care my\n[25:46] tests are passing. Um, I'm not going to\n[25:48] bother too much. Again, under crunch, I\n[25:51] can understand that over time. Um, it\n[25:54] can result in a horrible spaghetti code\n[25:56] and hard to maintain problems.\n[25:58] >> So, it's kind of like the balance.\n[26:00] Classic tech.\n[26:01] >> Speaking of reverting a commit, I'm very\n[26:04] nervous about letting AI make a commit.\n[26:07] >> No. Yeah, I didn't revert to commit. I\n[26:08] on stage like reverted all the changes\n[26:11] >> cuz sometimes claude\n[26:12] >> last commit\n[26:14] >> I feel takes some liberties because like\n[26:16] I don't want it to uh do get commits. I\n[26:18] should put that\n[26:19] >> absolutely not. No,\n[26:20] >> I should put that in my claw. MD, but\n[26:21] sometimes it does it. I'm like dude\n[26:23] stop.\n[26:24] >> Well, so I am very reluctant to let the\n[26:27] LLM do a commit. I usually I usually\n[26:30] stage the files and then I let I I\n[26:32] prompt the LLM and then I look at what\n[26:35] it did against the stage files and if\n[26:37] I'm happy I then stage additional files.\n[26:39] So that's like I I should be committing\n[26:41] more aggressively myself but I'm just\n[26:43] staging files until I'm happy and I know\n[26:45] that things work and then I want to do\n[26:47] commit because I like my commits to\n[26:48] work.\n[26:48] >> What is your workflow? cuz like for me\n[26:50] it's like I um I'm using VS Code at work\n[26:54] to be honest but but if I'm if I'm at\n[26:57] home I'm using claude code and then I\n[26:59] have another terminal where I'm like\n[27:01] checking the things that it does and\n[27:04] then in that terminal I'm also doing get\n[27:06] ads but I'm just curious if you are some\n[27:08] in turbo lazy get mode or something.\n[27:11] >> Yeah, so I have I have VS Code and I use\n[27:13] a shell the terminal in VS Code uh to\n[27:16] run cloud code which has an ID\n[27:18] integration. So that means cloud code\n[27:20] will open files into VS code to to show\n[27:22] the diff. If I didn't allow it to to to\n[27:24] make changes itself.\n[27:25] >> Uh also I don't know if it always\n[27:27] captures it but if you select something\n[27:29] then when you do a prompt it will say\n[27:30] and you have also the selected so it\n[27:32] reads your\n[27:33] >> Yeah. Um and then what I do is I stage\n[27:37] files that I like know that I'm happy\n[27:39] with the changes it made. Um just in the\n[27:42] UI on the left and you're just gonna\n[27:44] >> Yeah, I st but when I do the commits I\n[27:46] always do lazy get because I used to use\n[27:48] G g I used to like sign my commits and\n[27:51] for some reason it doesn't I I don't\n[27:54] have it now with my latest laptop but\n[27:56] I've got the habit now to always commit\n[27:57] through the terminal um because the\n[28:00] >> so you stage in VS Code and then you\n[28:02] jump into Lazy G to commit.\n[28:04] >> Yeah. Yeah,\n[28:06] >> it seems a bit more audible, but uh\n[28:09] >> no. Um\n[28:10] >> I I kind of like the VS Code commit\n[28:11] because it does the automatic commit\n[28:14] message summary.\n[28:16] >> H you know um\n[28:19] my commit messages are kind of like just\n[28:22] usually one headline of the feature or\n[28:24] the chore or the fix and then some\n[28:27] comments. Usually I look at the stage\n[28:29] files that I look at like I go through\n[28:31] the files on the left while I'm looking\n[28:33] at like oh we also added this oh we also\n[28:35] added that and then I just um yeah it's\n[28:38] conventional commits and and some\n[28:39] message body um but that's my usual\n[28:42] workflow\n[28:43] >> but but then when you were saying\n[28:44] earlier we're afraid of letting it\n[28:46] commit but when you work with cloud code\n[28:48] web and I I just like told it here's my\n[28:51] repo um integrate this new react\n[28:54] component library to replace my custom\n[28:56] components that that are kind of bad\n[28:58] that you wrote by the way. [laughter]\n[29:00] Um, and then cloud code just created a\n[29:02] branch and of course it has the only way\n[29:04] to get its work is by it committing and\n[29:06] it was committing all the time and uh it\n[29:10] was pretty cool. I just pulled the\n[29:11] changes to my local and then made some\n[29:13] changes, pushed it and\n[29:14] >> I guess that's like a that's like the\n[29:17] thing I want to control. I can get yes\n[29:20] or no. I can get yes or no.\n[29:23] >> Oh [snorts] my god. So with the with the\n[29:25] PR workflow that I'm setting up the\n[29:27] release workflow now I'm I'm I'm doing\n[29:29] release please with um with go releaser\n[29:32] and I want the PRs to be merged uh\n[29:35] squash merged merged so no matter how\n[29:37] many commits it did on the branch it\n[29:39] will all become one commit when the PR\n[29:41] is merged.\n[29:41] >> Right. Right. Right.\n[29:42] >> And that works well with with like\n[29:43] release please to find what has changed\n[29:45] and then it creates a release PR keeping\n[29:47] track of every uh PR merge that\n[29:49] happened.\n[29:50] >> Yeah. I mean when I'm devel I mean I was\n[29:52] developing like a Terraform workflow\n[29:54] yesterday\n[29:56] I I kind of wish that I could have got\n[29:58] AI to do it but it was one of those\n[30:00] things where this [clears throat] a this\n[30:02] workflow was part of all these other\n[30:04] workflows and these all these other\n[30:05] secrets so you could only trigger it\n[30:07] through GitHub workflow. So I was going\n[30:09] really really really slowly because I\n[30:11] was like get commit uh you know - a - m\n[30:17] fix uh and and git push and then and\n[30:21] then triggering a workflow.\n[30:24] One good thing is that I got AI to to be\n[30:27] able to read the the workflow error log.\n[30:30] >> Yeah.\n[30:31] >> And then it can help me iterate on that\n[30:34] thing. But it's still it was slow to\n[30:37] iterate and it was uh yeah\n[30:39] >> CI/CD is always slow.\n[30:41] >> That's why you need you need project\n[30:43] like earthly or what's it called? Dagger\n[30:45] from the Docker Solomon.\n[30:47] >> I've been I've been dipping into Dagger\n[30:49] but I never got much out of it. I mean\n[30:51] have you got any joy out of\n[30:54] >> Did I say Docker Solomon? I meant\n[30:55] Solomon hikes from Docker. Yeah, I\n[30:57] haven't.\n[30:58] >> [snorts]\n[30:59] >> So the I really like the idea behind\n[31:02] Dagger.\n[31:03] >> Um because Doc Solomon says\n[31:07] we failed. If Docker is just a runtime\n[31:10] for containers, Docker failed um because\n[31:14] the idea was to improve the the\n[31:17] ecosystem dev ecosystem, right? um\n[31:19] Docker Docker Mac uh is basically a\n[31:23] transparent way of um getting things to\n[31:25] work on your machine and that their\n[31:27] focus was always dev tooling.\n[31:29] >> Not super transparent to be honest, but\n[31:31] yeah. Okay,\n[31:32] >> that was their idea, right? The whole\n[31:34] idea of um cloud when they released\n[31:38] Docker, their internal container stuff\n[31:40] was dev tooling and they really\n[31:42] optimized the dev workflow, you know, of\n[31:44] building and having it run across\n[31:46] different machines, right? build chip\n[31:48] run was always uh\n[31:50] >> their their moto right um and so with\n[31:53] Dagger says I'm focused on the dev\n[31:55] workflow like CI/CD is horrible\n[31:57] experience we want to be the ability to\n[32:00] um reproducibly have our CI/CD pipeline\n[32:03] and at the same time there was\n[32:04] earthly.dev dev and there was another\n[32:05] one as well that were trying to do the\n[32:07] same thing\n[32:09] >> but but but I mean they must have failed\n[32:11] because I don't know anyone who's doing\n[32:12] this stuff locally everyone GitHub\n[32:14] workflows have won the day\n[32:17] >> and uh I mean I have this really\n[32:20] >> this is a horrible experience um but I\n[32:22] had the same with AI though it's really\n[32:24] nice I used the GitHub CLI did you is\n[32:26] that how you integrated with the with\n[32:28] >> Yeah yeah yeah I have this like MCP\n[32:30] snippet where I just expose the the\n[32:33] actions tool tool set because the MCP\n[32:37] >> is too big\n[32:38] >> is too big from GitHub.\n[32:39] >> So this is where I do few shop samples,\n[32:41] right? I I basically push my commit to\n[32:44] the PR the the workflows run and I I go\n[32:47] into a cloud code. I run the shell. I\n[32:49] say GitHub dash uh or GitHub PR check\n[32:55] number three. And then it shows these\n[32:57] are all the checks that run and these\n[32:58] succeeded. This how how much they took.\n[33:00] This is a job uh description or the link\n[33:02] to the job ID. Um and then you just go\n[33:06] uh GitHub CLI um PR or is it run view\n[33:11] and then you can do either run id or or\n[33:14] with the argument flag d- job and you\n[33:17] just pass that job from that PR check in\n[33:18] there. And when I first show to cloud\n[33:21] code I do these commands myself. So it\n[33:23] sees the output and you can you can do\n[33:25] d-lock failed and whatever. Then it\n[33:27] started using jq to like you know JSON\n[33:30] outputs to parse through things. Um, but\n[33:32] it was I don't know. It did things that\n[33:34] I thought wasn't really necessary. But I\n[33:36] don't need an MCP. I don't need\n[33:38] anything. I'm just showing it the GitHub\n[33:40] CLI command\n[33:41] >> and then it just goes in a loop. It just\n[33:43] like, oh, I see it's failing here. Oh, I\n[33:44] see this problem.\n[33:45] >> So, I'm in I'm in that team showing\n[33:47] GitHub what to do. But like\n[33:50] >> not repeatedly, not every time, all the\n[33:51] time.\n[33:52] >> My my colleague my colleague asked u\n[33:56] a good question in a sense. is like he\n[33:58] asked like what do I uh I need to use\n[34:02] the GitHub CLI what should I use the\n[34:04] GitHub MCP\n[34:06] or some other approach and then\n[34:09] basically I chimed in and said like well\n[34:12] the GitHub C MCP sucks because it's too\n[34:16] verbose and it wastes your tokens but if\n[34:19] you use the GitHub um API or CLI sorry\n[34:22] if you use the GH CLI you have to tell\n[34:24] it how what to use. So my my colleague\n[34:27] is a bit of a noob.\n[34:30] >> I I think to be honest he wasn't he was\n[34:33] a little bit confused by what I was\n[34:34] saying like you have to teach\n[34:37] uh GHLI you have to you have to teach\n[34:40] the the the\n[34:42] better way is to teaching the AI how to\n[34:44] use the command. I mean that kind of\n[34:46] blew his brain.\n[34:47] >> Cloud skills are full right?\n[34:52] >> I need Okay, then I need a skill to use\n[34:54] the GitHub CLI. That's a good\n[34:56] [clears throat] weekend project. That's\n[34:57] a good weekend project.\n[34:59] >> For sure there's one.\n[35:01] >> For sure there's one.\n[35:02] >> There's actually people that are writing\n[35:04] LLM like agents to create skills and you\n[35:07] give it a couple of prompts of what it\n[35:08] does and then it will explore the CLI\n[35:10] and it will write an a like an agent\n[35:12] skill which I think is a bit dumb right\n[35:14] uh but like if it works it works. The\n[35:16] whole idea of the of cloud skills is\n[35:18] progressive disclosure. So you start\n[35:20] with like the first basic flows and then\n[35:21] if you need more do this, if you need\n[35:23] more, do that. And then cloud is\n[35:25] supposed to like parse through it and\n[35:27] and and progressively\n[35:30] read more to like be able to do more.\n[35:32] And and yes, that should be the way that\n[35:34] you don't always have to show how to use\n[35:36] a GH CLI every time, but you\n[35:39] >> You're right. You're right. I should\n[35:40] have thought about that cuz I think my\n[35:41] colleague just was thinking I was an\n[35:43] idiot or something like that. Like\n[35:46] >> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I need to I need Do do\n[35:49] you have you created any skills?\n[35:51] >> No, I've only like played with the beats\n[35:54] skill, right? But I don't like I\n[35:57] integrated it so it's living somewhere\n[35:59] in my I think it's in your home\n[36:00] directory.\n[36:01] >> The the problem is in my world like I\n[36:03] have my personal claude code space which\n[36:06] is fun but daytoday in my in my\n[36:10] workplace I'm using VS code and VS code\n[36:12] doesn't support skills. I believe\n[36:14] >> they they have something in speckit they\n[36:16] have like they have a different way now\n[36:18] to expose different agents sub agents\n[36:21] into your VS code as well when when I\n[36:24] look at the specit latest presentation\n[36:26] from from the guy who who uh is like one\n[36:29] of the main advocates on YouTube he\n[36:31] showed how they have like integrated\n[36:33] speckit into vs code settings like\n[36:36] copilotcopilot/s\n[36:38] settings.json JSON or something and they\n[36:39] have like declared all of the agents\n[36:42] that the specket provides. So then when\n[36:45] you are in the chat window of VS code\n[36:47] you can switch between these agents and\n[36:49] one of them is like the speckit plan\n[36:51] >> better at VS code or something like\n[36:52] that.\n[36:53] >> Look at the the speckit YouTube video\n[36:56] channel and then one of the latest\n[36:57] videos he shows how how they they are\n[37:00] they are exporting the LLM specket\n[37:02] agents into VS code. So I think if you\n[37:06] can do that, you have dedicated agents,\n[37:08] maybe there's a way to like have the\n[37:10] agent skills as well. Um cuz again like\n[37:14] they are constantly feeding off each\n[37:16] other, right? One one company brings\n[37:18] something out, another one copies it.\n[37:21] >> Oh, sorry. I'm getting distracted. My\n[37:23] wife is messaging me about the school\n[37:24] run.\n[37:26] What time do you have to go back to work\n[37:28] in 20 minutes or something?\n[37:29] >> Yeah, something like that.\n[37:31] You said earlier something about um when\n[37:34] your colleague asked and teaching it how\n[37:36] to use ah um I think that's where if you\n[37:39] are a terminal like somebody who likes\n[37:41] to live in the terminal tools like cloud\n[37:43] code kind of feels very cool because you\n[37:47] are then you already are used to create\n[37:50] pull requests using gh right you already\n[37:52] go ghbrr create-fill\n[37:55] whatever u you push your branches from\n[37:57] with git so you're you're not someone\n[37:59] that goes to to the web and then clicks\n[38:02] on a button to create and so and so on.\n[38:04] Right?\n[38:05] >> So that's where I think that transfers\n[38:07] easily into these other\n[38:09] >> going back right back to what Steve Jo's\n[38:11] talk was about was that like he was\n[38:13] saying that the statistics in companies\n[38:16] where people are adopting AI and they\n[38:19] are are are by all measures uh becoming\n[38:24] more productive and then there's the\n[38:26] senior staff engineers who go who who\n[38:30] who there there people in a company who\n[38:33] are not adopting it.\n[38:34] >> So what do you do with those people who\n[38:38] are not adopting it? And to be honest, I\n[38:39] see that in my workplace. It's like I'm\n[38:41] using AI like uh like like you, I\n[38:45] suppose, and I see the benefit, but\n[38:49] there's some there's there's there's\n[38:50] definitely uh members of my team who are\n[38:54] just completely not interested in in\n[38:56] picking up these new workflows. I'm\n[38:57] like,\n[38:59] >> so I had I I went to a Q Q&A conference\n[39:03] back in June and one of I did I was\n[39:05] invited on the panel and one of the\n[39:06] audience questions was exactly this like\n[39:09] as a team lead because QA and and and\n[39:11] and LLMs it's quite a big a big changing\n[39:14] there right automation of of LLM\n[39:16] generating test cases and all sorry\n[39:18] automation of of tests and generating\n[39:21] test cases and test data um so one of\n[39:24] the the people there was like how can I\n[39:26] help or ensure everyone within the team\n[39:29] um picks up on these LLMs um and and the\n[39:33] reply from the the panel members and\n[39:35] some some somebody worked at Singapore\n[39:37] Airlines and he says we we create a\n[39:39] prompt database we do regular brown bags\n[39:42] we we um you know we share people with\n[39:45] different workflows on on how it helps\n[39:47] uh but at the same time when you're\n[39:49] saying like there's these senior\n[39:50] engineer who is really reluctant to to\n[39:53] pick us up I think maybe you need\n[39:55] someone of those in your company, right?\n[39:57] Maybe you need someone. Uh, and that\n[39:59] that makes me think of a Reddit post I\n[40:01] saw on the DevOps subreddit, I think\n[40:03] this week, which was like, I'm so\n[40:05] frustrated. Everyone in my team is using\n[40:07] LLM and I'm like the only one that's\n[40:09] actually doing manual reviews of all\n[40:10] these PRs and I'm reading all these PRs\n[40:13] and I'm like the I feel like I'm the\n[40:14] only one like commenting on these lines\n[40:16] of code and saying like why is this like\n[40:18] that and so on. So, so um\n[40:20] >> but still I mean maybe yeah, I see your\n[40:22] point. There's definitely\n[40:25] definitely like an argument to be made.\n[40:27] Okay, here's another problem that I hit\n[40:29] out of work, right, is that strictly\n[40:33] speaking, we have a co-pilot license\n[40:36] and I think there's basically the JBT\n[40:41] models exposed there,\n[40:43] >> but I want to use I want to use Claude.\n[40:46] So, VS Code gives me an ability and to\n[40:49] paste in an API key for uh Claude as\n[40:52] well as Google Gemini and all the other\n[40:55] stuff.\n[40:56] >> But then you then you have this\n[40:57] conundrum like hm the company hasn't\n[41:00] expressly approved this model and that\n[41:04] model.\n[41:04] >> Can I use it?\n[41:06] >> Yeah. And and then furthermore, there's\n[41:09] a whole uh topic around um the you know,\n[41:14] who's going to pay for this.\n[41:16] >> Um\n[41:19] >> I feel like these are unresolved issues,\n[41:20] but maybe maybe let's get back to I\n[41:23] think I think I need to do the school\n[41:25] run. It's it's it's icy out here. My\n[41:27] wife doesn't want to drive in that in\n[41:29] the\n[41:30] >> I need to take the kids to school. Okay.\n[41:32] Yeah. Um just on that point right for me\n[41:35] currently\n[41:37] I'm I'm using I'm this is I think if\n[41:39] you're in in infrastructure and DevOps\n[41:42] I've always said these are to me are the\n[41:43] most interesting fields to be in because\n[41:46] it's the same everywhere. It's not\n[41:48] secret sauce. It's not this the the the\n[41:50] the secret terraform everywhere.\n[41:54] >> What do you mean?\n[41:54] >> Yeah. I mean the ideas of running\n[41:56] infrastructure on the cloud and setting\n[41:57] up uh you know observability dashboards\n[42:00] and monitors and CI/CD pipelines it's\n[42:03] not a core differentiator or secret\n[42:06] sauce of an organization it's not like\n[42:08] something that's propri saying yeah\n[42:11] right the skills are transferable\n[42:13] >> exactly so I used to coach or work with\n[42:17] product engineers and then try to\n[42:18] convince them like why do you you know\n[42:21] bother with working purely on business\n[42:24] um um business feature uh tickets, user\n[42:28] stories and so on. I isn't it way more\n[42:30] interesting to be in the DevOps space\n[42:32] and then be like exposed to something\n[42:33] that's you much more transferable\n[42:36] between organizations when you want to\n[42:37] change as well. Um but that was then\n[42:40] until I got into a position where DevOps\n[42:42] was really seen as a cost center and\n[42:44] then you are like completely blocked to\n[42:45] do any type of refactoring because why\n[42:48] would you want to do this and and um you\n[42:50] know\n[42:51] >> this sounds like my life right now to be\n[42:52] honest.\n[42:53] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and I was always\n[42:54] super happy to be DevOps. Uh but then\n[42:56] you have the ne negatives which are like\n[42:59] um you know unthankful because nobody\n[43:02] cares everything's running. and people\n[43:04] are wondering what is this guy doing\n[43:05] until there's an outage and then\n[43:07] everyone's you know breathing down your\n[43:08] neck and why is it down [laughter] and\n[43:10] then uh I had a few companies where\n[43:12] there was like a celebrity uh but that\n[43:14] was a pretty dire state right because\n[43:16] the whole website was down and you\n[43:17] managed to recover it within x amount of\n[43:19] time and then you're like\n[43:20] >> this hero [laughter] this hero thing\n[43:22] like yeah you saved the day dude you got\n[43:25] the website back up maybe it shouldn't\n[43:26] have been down in the first place for\n[43:28] Christ's sake\n[43:29] >> yeah it depends also if you're the fire\n[43:31] starter right if you're the ones putting\n[43:33] fires all the time that you are actually\n[43:34] the fire starter [laughter] but yeah\n[43:36] yeah yeah um yeah it's that was\n[43:39] >> industry isn't it\n[43:41] >> so that's where I think using LLMs for\n[43:43] DevOps related tasks is easier because\n[43:45] it's like it's not so proprietary and a\n[43:48] lot of the things I do I actually take\n[43:49] an open source library and I I work on\n[43:52] adding features there so I'm saying to\n[43:54] everyone like hey don't I I this rule\n[43:57] doesn't apply to me because I'm taking\n[43:59] an Apache 2 library I'm putting it as an\n[44:02] open source fork and all of my cloud\n[44:04] code generated code uh is not related to\n[44:07] any company data. But but like do you\n[44:10] think like for example do you think\n[44:13] Google uh trains\n[44:16] the Gemini model on their own\n[44:18] proprietary uh code base? I I I think\n[44:22] there would be afraid that there would\n[44:23] be excilation of data, right? That I\n[44:25] think there's clear cases of of\n[44:27] >> So basically like you so if you went to\n[44:29] Gemini say create me a Google search\n[44:32] engine, they would it just wouldn't\n[44:34] >> I'm pretty sure that there's a whole\n[44:37] [snorts] like actors trying to\n[44:39] excfiltrate as much. I mean they all\n[44:40] they always say that Quen when it was\n[44:42] like trained and like how many% of the\n[44:45] total cost that OpenAI and other\n[44:47] companies spend quen AI from China was\n[44:50] developed with like a fraction of the\n[44:52] cost and they say it's trained on\n[44:53] synthetic data. trained exfiltrated uh\n[44:56] from all of the um you know open AI\n[44:58] models and so on right so so there's\n[45:01] definitely organizations trying to\n[45:03] excfiltrate any type of proprietary\n[45:05] information from companies and I think\n[45:08] Google must separate the training data\n[45:11] for\n[45:11] >> but I don't think other companies have\n[45:13] that luxury I think that I think the um\n[45:17] I mean\n[45:19] okay\n[45:20] obviously people are trying to keep\n[45:22] their own proprietary source code um\n[45:25] safe and obviously their their private\n[45:28] GitHub repos are not being indexed\n[45:31] by um by a model. But nonetheless,\n[45:37] um,\n[45:39] you know, I'm sure if you ask a CTO of\n[45:41] of a company with a big code base and\n[45:44] they and and you asked and you said to\n[45:46] them like, uh, would you like a model\n[45:49] that knows about your coding style and\n[45:52] your uh, and your existing code? They\n[45:55] would jump at it, right?\n[45:57] >> Yeah, there's companies doing that,\n[45:58] right?\n[45:58] >> So, there's a bit of a a chasm there,\n[46:00] like how do you bridge that? So, so\n[46:03] source graph is had very has a a lot of\n[46:06] interesting YouTube videos because\n[46:07] source graph positioned themselves as\n[46:09] the originally enterprise solution for\n[46:12] code like search right so they have big\n[46:14] contracts with enterprises for you know\n[46:16] propriety self-hosted deployments um to\n[46:19] index the code and for you know JP\n[46:22] Morgan whatever huge clients to to for\n[46:24] their software engineers to quickly find\n[46:26] um code or relevant um microservices for\n[46:30] certain functionality across all of the\n[46:31] code base right so [snorts] then they\n[46:33] they are also having their LLM on top of\n[46:35] this now like Annie I think it's called\n[46:37] or uh\n[46:38] >> okay so there there are products for\n[46:40] this okay\n[46:41] >> yeah yeah um and and a lot of yeah when\n[46:47] earlier\n[46:47] >> I mean I mean GitHub GitHub needs to do\n[46:49] this next seriously I mean like\n[46:52] >> so when we talked about I'm using VS\n[46:54] Code and um and then I'm not sure which\n[46:57] model I have access to I can give it an\n[46:58] API key and what's the contract like\n[47:00] when I talk to someone from GitHub he\n[47:03] was visiting in Vietnam. He told me that\n[47:05] they have very strict um contracts in\n[47:09] place with enterprises and how they are\n[47:12] using the code. And also when you sign\n[47:14] with with the with Microsoft and on the\n[47:16] GitHub enterprise, you decide like\n[47:20] for example, one of the risks that\n[47:22] companies have is that they get um a\n[47:24] lawsuit for copying code, right? if they\n[47:27] use an AI, how can GitHub copilot\n[47:30] deployed across all of these people that\n[47:31] are using the AI guarantee that I'm not\n[47:34] generating code that is proprietary or\n[47:36] that is copyrighted and that's now in my\n[47:39] codebase. Like imagine it's a GPL and\n[47:41] now I have to open source everything. Um\n[47:44] so so that's a risk. So so Microsoft has\n[47:47] these contracts in place that says first\n[47:49] off it it sources different it generates\n[47:52] solutions\n[47:52] >> mess up like what stops one of my team.\n[47:54] >> Hold on. You haven't listened how they\n[47:55] solved it yet. So he told me that they\n[47:57] are generating different code solutions\n[47:59] and then they do a cross check to any\n[48:01] like existing and licensed code in their\n[48:03] database and then they're you know\n[48:06] rejecting anything that could be and\n[48:08] then they're sending you only the one\n[48:09] that is passing all of that. Sometimes\n[48:11] co-pilot gives you code and then\n[48:12] suddenly gets removed says like this is\n[48:15] a copyrighted code I can't give you that\n[48:18] >> and then the second thing is what he\n[48:19] told me is that Microsoft actually will\n[48:23] sponsor you in if there's a lawsuit if\n[48:25] you if you prove that this code is\n[48:27] generated by co-pilot and Microsoft will\n[48:29] be part of the lawsuit that's why he\n[48:30] told me like part of the contract\n[48:32] stipulates that if your company gets um\n[48:35] gets what's it called um\n[48:38] >> extra lawsuit yeah no gets a lawsuit\n[48:41] against you like um then\n[48:44] >> Oh, okay. Because you're using source\n[48:45] code that might be interpreted as being\n[48:47] proprietary.\n[48:48] >> Yeah. So, so basically you said it's\n[48:50] very hard but he was saying that's one\n[48:51] of the things Microsoft has to convince\n[48:53] enterprise users that they are\n[48:55] protecting. seems like a a good tact but\n[48:57] but I mean at the end of the day that's\n[49:00] that's Microsoft that's GitHub they they\n[49:02] know about your proprietary code but\n[49:05] like\n[49:06] >> like how how about this scenario like\n[49:09] there's a new there's a new edit there's\n[49:11] a new IDE let's call it anti-gravity and\n[49:14] someone like oh wow this can help me do\n[49:16] my job and then he just launches on his\n[49:19] proprietary codebase and then all of a\n[49:21] sudden\n[49:23] >> so that's where Um it's it's important\n[49:27] for organizations to put in place AI\n[49:30] policies and and and books um what's it\n[49:33] called? Runbooks or guides because if if\n[49:36] this happens, right, it means that the\n[49:37] user hasn't really been informed um or\n[49:40] or [snorts] he's like maliciously doing\n[49:43] it. He knows that it's not allowed but\n[49:44] he's going to do it or he's not know he\n[49:46] doesn't know about the risk and he just\n[49:47] installs it and then he hasn't been\n[49:48] trained. Right? So, so in my\n[49:51] organization we had um to sign a\n[49:54] contract that says that I will not copy\n[49:56] proprietary and this is we had to first\n[49:58] learn what is propriety and confidential\n[50:00] information. who like no be no no be uh\n[50:03] no before trainings and then also sign a\n[50:06] contract saying like\n[50:07] >> you know if they find out that I do this\n[50:10] but I'm not doing it [laughter]\n[50:12] >> then I will be\n[50:13] >> like one thing in in some workplaces\n[50:16] that I like to do is to encourage the\n[50:18] use of code spaces do you know GitHub\n[50:21] GitHub code space\n[50:22] >> yeah I haven't used it but yeah\n[50:23] >> but the cool thing about that is that\n[50:25] like the code is there and it's not on\n[50:27] your local machine and it's there's a\n[50:29] nice clear division And\n[50:32] yeah, I'm just finding it hard like\n[50:34] because\n[50:37] like yeah, like we we like I I we have a\n[50:42] special API key with u with a particular\n[50:46] vendor. I'm not going to say who, which\n[50:48] gives us private confidentiality with\n[50:50] the code that we use on it. But then\n[50:53] it's not clear if we have permission\n[50:55] from the client if we can\n[50:58] use uh\n[51:01] >> snippets of the like like to be honest\n[51:02] I'm not even using\n[51:05] the code base right it's it's like what\n[51:07] you were saying with the Terraform it's\n[51:08] like uh I mean not Terraform like\n[51:10] infrastructures code it's like maybe I'm\n[51:12] trying to debug a GitHub workflow that's\n[51:15] no different to anyone else's Terraform\n[51:17] plan and apply and I would want to use\n[51:21] that that that paid for model and and\n[51:24] and then I'm always a little bit like hm\n[51:27] I'm not sure I can do this because\n[51:29] technically what I've just copy and\n[51:31] pasted here is proprietary code but it\n[51:34] isn't really and yeah all this ambiguity\n[51:39] makes makes the whole experience a\n[51:42] little bit crappy\n[51:45] right um but but I was going to say that\n[51:48] you are somebody that then worries about\n[51:49] that either because you've been trained\n[51:51] or informed about these risks. Um so you\n[51:55] know that's because your company has put\n[51:58] in place policies so that you are\n[52:01] knowledgeable about these things right\n[52:03] if if you look at many other people\n[52:04] >> but the policies are not clear they they\n[52:07] just create FUD you know what I mean\n[52:08] like and FUD is worse than\n[52:10] >> fear uncertainty and doubt\n[52:13] >> which is a crypto term like crypto\n[52:16] >> I mean [sighs]\n[52:18] how many how many companies have really\n[52:20] clear policies with AI like you can only\n[52:25] use this model and that model and that's\n[52:27] it. I don't I don't think I've seen any\n[52:31] I don't seen I don't think I've seen\n[52:32] any.\n[52:34] >> I think that's where your organization\n[52:35] is providing you with access to AI and\n[52:38] my organization is giving us access to\n[52:40] GitHub copilot. I I am naming it. Um but\n[52:44] um that also at the enterprise level the\n[52:47] organization level they control which\n[52:49] models the users have access to. In our\n[52:51] case, we can only select the ones that\n[52:53] that they have approved in our\n[52:55] organization.\n[52:56] >> Okay. In in code in VS Code basically,\n[52:59] right?\n[52:59] >> And I only know this I don't manage\n[53:00] this, but I know this because somebody\n[53:02] in in the chat asked like, \"Hey, they\n[53:04] just released Sun 4.5. We can only\n[53:06] access four. Can you give us access to\n[53:07] this new model and then somebody has to\n[53:09] go into it and then give access to it?\"\n[53:12] >> You say that and I think it's I think\n[53:13] what you're saying is true, but at the\n[53:15] same time, VS Code gives me the option\n[53:17] just to paste in an API key. So like\n[53:20] >> Yeah. I don't know like I'm not using\n[53:21] the VS code one and again I'm I'm\n[53:24] excusing my not using it by only working\n[53:26] on on repositories that are not private\n[53:29] [laughter]\n[53:30] and um and basically if I do something\n[53:34] um yeah anyway so so I don't know if I\n[53:39] can add the key but earlier you also say\n[53:41] if you use VS code in the first place\n[53:43] right um the guy who was working at\n[53:46] Microsoft was telling me that the plugin\n[53:50] system at the time which is more than a\n[53:51] year ago had no control about like VS\n[53:54] Code did not have any any constraints on\n[53:56] what the plug-in could read. So a\n[53:58] plug-in could just read anything from\n[53:59] your your your folder, right? And I\n[54:02] think they have improved that now\n[54:03] because now whenever you install an\n[54:04] extension, it tells you like, \"Watch\n[54:06] out. Do you trust these people?\" And\n[54:08] that's all they did basically.\n[54:10] >> Yeah. I mean, yeah. V extensions.\n[54:12] >> Yeah. Like\n[54:13] >> Yeah. I mean, that's a good that's a\n[54:15] good uh segue because, you know, people\n[54:18] go like, \"Oh, did you get approval to\n[54:21] use these model thing like that?\"\n[54:23] They're like, \"It's there. I mean, I\n[54:25] didn't uh you know, if they wanted to\n[54:27] prohibit it, they Yeah, but you should\n[54:29] get approval before you use anything.\n[54:31] It's like, how many extensions do you\n[54:33] have installed? You're like, how many\n[54:34] tools do you have installed? Did you get\n[54:36] permission for every one of those\n[54:38] extensions or tools that you get have\n[54:40] installed? I mean, you're being\n[54:41] ridiculous. So,\n[54:43] >> and that's one of the things the\n[54:44] Microsoft guy told me as well. This is\n[54:46] something that they as the uh copilot\n[54:48] extension implementation uh provider he\n[54:52] he said it was actually GitHub acquired\n[54:53] by Microsoft right he said that they\n[54:55] guarantee that it will only read files\n[54:58] that you have open in the editor it will\n[55:00] not read anything from the disk so um\n[55:03] that's the type of guarantees that you\n[55:04] like I don't know that until he told me\n[55:06] right it's probably somewhere in the\n[55:07] fine print I don't know about the MD\n[55:09] gravity right now uh from Google I just\n[55:11] installed it I gave it the code base\n[55:13] which is open source uh to work on and\n[55:15] it probably read everything anyway and\n[55:17] it must be able to because if it can't\n[55:19] it wouldn't wouldn't have been able to\n[55:21] do such a good job to find exactly where\n[55:23] it needed to change what right\n[55:25] >> yeah\n[55:27] well okay I I wanted to end the the\n[55:30] conversation on something a little bit\n[55:31] more positive but um I guess the\n[55:33] positive thing is that the all these uh\n[55:35] we're living in a really exciting time\n[55:38] really I'm really digging the fact that\n[55:40] I'm alive I mean it's amazing I mean\n[55:43] like the future's is is bonkers, isn't\n[55:46] it? It's incredible.\n[55:49] >> So, I agree absolutely with what you\n[55:52] just said, but my second the second part\n[55:54] about the future is where I'm like, for\n[55:57] how long? [laughter]\n[55:58] For how long?\n[56:00] >> I do feel I do feel this stuff for $20 a\n[56:02] month.\n[56:02] >> I'm probably like in\n[56:05] positive. I'm I'm in that that maybe the\n[56:07] plateau camp like I do feel like we are\n[56:11] hitting a surge cuz some people say like\n[56:14] oh this thing is just going to go like\n[56:15] this like like like forever and I'm like\n[56:19] I think the models are improving but not\n[56:22] as fast as you would think cuz the\n[56:24] models I I feel have a limited training\n[56:27] supply right they're not they're not\n[56:29] going to invent new information that\n[56:30] it's going to plateau essentially by how\n[56:34] much good stuff there is for it to be\n[56:37] trained on, right?\n[56:39] >> If it's like software,\n[56:41] um\n[56:43] where it's just an ever expanding gas,\n[56:45] it takes up whatever resources are\n[56:46] available. Um I think with with AI right\n[56:50] now, it's taking up every resource it\n[56:51] can in terms of electricity and power\n[56:54] and um you know, GPU capacity. Um, it's\n[56:59] very hard to predict because\n[57:02] before the release of Gemini 3 this\n[57:04] week, everyone was like, \"What happened\n[57:06] to Google? Gemini 2.5 Pro, me included,\n[57:08] in March was great. Now, what's what\n[57:12] really have to like be really good? Is\n[57:14] it delay?\" Because is there a disarray?\n[57:16] There was so many articles about cuz I\n[57:18] searched Gemini 3.0 release pretty much\n[57:21] every day to find out if there was any\n[57:22] news and every article you're like,\n[57:24] \"When is the next?\"\n[57:25] >> Yeah. because I had to get things done\n[57:28] by Wednesday and I was like hoping\n[57:30] Gemini 2.3 zero release I get some free\n[57:32] credits.\n[57:33] >> Your claw tokens or your claw budget was\n[57:36] almost expired.\n[57:37] >> Every article I read before Wednesday\n[57:40] was like\n[57:42] >> the truth and the disarray within\n[57:44] Google. Google is completely unable to\n[57:46] handle it. Google has lost has lost it.\n[57:49] You know what is about these TPUs?\n[57:51] there's a TPU supposedly rolled out and\n[57:53] give them the edge across the world but\n[57:54] the infrastructure is delayed that's why\n[57:56] Gemini 3 is delayed and blah blah blah\n[57:58] but then Gemini came out and everyone's\n[58:00] like Google did it Google is the market\n[58:01] leader look at at um how Google Gemini\n[58:04] 3.0 zero is like this high in the\n[58:06] benchmarks. Does that give like um what\n[58:08] they called it again? Because you have a\n[58:10] much small smarter model within your\n[58:12] organization and you have full access to\n[58:13] it. That means that you have the ability\n[58:16] to accelerate much faster than the other\n[58:17] companies, right? So with the\n[58:19] announcement of Gemini 3 and in how good\n[58:21] it is compared to GPT 5.1 and 74.5 that\n[58:24] gives them not just like a small edge\n[58:27] that gives them a massive edge because\n[58:28] it means internally they can have like a\n[58:30] hundreds of Gemini trees running and\n[58:32] improving on the product.\n[58:33] >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean like I definitely\n[58:35] felt that uh maybe as long as a year ago\n[58:39] that that all of a sudden like Google\n[58:42] Sheets and uh Google Docs basically got\n[58:45] a whole bunch of new features and like\n[58:48] previous 5 years\n[58:51] Google Docs and the Google Suite felt\n[58:53] frankly unmaintained. And I was thinking\n[58:56] to myself like why all of a sudden is\n[58:59] there so many cool new features\n[59:02] >> after they lay off 30,000 people or\n[59:04] something. [laughter] Why suddenly\n[59:06] Google Sheets have all these new\n[59:07] features? H\n[59:09] >> well okay there could be other\n[59:11] mitigating factors but I did I did I did\n[59:15] basically occur to me that like maybe\n[59:17] they have some technology that we don't\n[59:19] have or something or or do you think\n[59:22] it's the fact that they laid off people?\n[59:24] >> No. No, no, no. I was just correlating\n[59:26] with the fact that they laid off people\n[59:28] and and so it must be llams or\n[59:31] something, right? How can you suddenly\n[59:33] have a whole bunch of new kettle of fish\n[59:35] >> after you lay off all these people?\n[59:37] >> Yeah, let's let's get back to that. I I\n[59:39] think I've got to wind this up. Anyway,\n[59:41] it's been it was a great chat. I'll\n[59:43] upload it. I'll share the link and I ask\n[59:47] everyone to\n[59:50] please like and subscribe and share the\n[59:54] podcast.\n[59:57] >> And and and and comment below like if we\n[1:00:00] said something stupid or something\n[1:00:02] better if we could have said something\n[1:00:03] better or then let let us know that\n[1:00:06] >> this comment will be Google did not lay\n[1:00:07] off 30,000 people. It was more like\n[1:00:09] 100,000 people.\n[1:00:10] >> Yeah.\n[1:00:12] >> Okay. We're hoping to get in intelligent\n[1:00:14] comments. To be honest, the comments\n[1:00:16] section is always not as good as I hoped\n[1:00:19] it to be. All right.\n[1:00:22] So, you're instigating right now.\n[1:00:25] >> I wouldn't I wouldn't take it.\n[1:00:26] >> I speak the truth only.\n[1:00:28] >> I wouldn't I wouldn't take it.\n[1:00:29] >> Okay. See you. See you, Vincent. Bye.",

Do not mention or acknowledge them, and do not say you skipped or ignored anything. Avoid sponsor/ad/promo language, brand names like Squarespace, or CTA phrases like discount code. Treat them as if they do not exist. If a slide segment is purely sponsor/ad content, leave that slide marker with no text.\nWrite a detailed summary that captures the main points, supporting facts, and concrete numbers or quotes when present.\nUse the slide format below. Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 72,592 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line. Use straight quotation marks (no curly) as needed. If no suitable line exists, omit excerpts.

Uh I don't know where to\nstart even like like uh Okay. What do\nyou think of the Gemini 3 Pro thing?\nHave you managed to get on it?\n>> Um I'm using anti-gravity and I got some\nGemini 3 Pro for free, so obviously my\nlimits are pretty bad. Um, and it has\nbeen I mean I started I'm like a day I'm\nshifted in in like 12 hours compared to\nwhen they announced it, right? But that\nalso means that I'm online when most\nAmericans that try it out are offline.\nSo I I have to fight with other\nSoutheast Asianbased people which not\neveryone is following the latest Gemini\ntree release. So the first day I had a\ndecent amount of work done by Gemini 3.\nIt was pretty good. The experience in\nanti-gravity was also pretty nice. It\ngives you a couple of new like things\nreviewing files. I haven't used cursor\nso I wasn't too familiar with like a\nproper IDE integration. I've given up on\nVisual Studio Code Copilot for a while\nalready. I'm purely in CLI land. So\nusing an IDE and you know it's it's\n[snorts] been a long time before the LM\nwas like rewriting the whole file and\nyou had to watch it rewrite and you go\nlike no don't change that. Ah and now\nit's it just instantly pops up with like\num this has changed this has changed you\ncan review this file. So it's pretty\npretty cool. Yeah\n>> because um I don't know if you saw that\nlink I sent you yesterday to some AR AI\nsummit with Steve Jger and uh\n>> it was it was live right? I I didn't\nwatch it live\n>> because I like to fast forward and so\non. So,\n>> well, I I just someone shared the link\nand I just tapped on it and like Steve\nJger was giving his uh his his spiel\nlive and uh it was pretty good. It\n>> It was a pretty good\n>> I definitely want to see that now. You\ntold me that he's talking about it. I\nsee a lot of improvements on the\n>> but like one of his like he says like,\n\"Oh, I needed to give a hot take and\nhere's my hot take. You're a bad\nengineer if you use an IDE by the end of\nthe year. Thought\n>> by the end of the year. Oh, that's a hot\ntake.\n>> Interesting.\n>> Like but like an IDE.\n>> Is he sponsored by Warp now? [laughter]\n>> Well, the thing is the AI summit was\nlike sponsored by I think Google and\nGoogle was like anti-gravity this,\nanti-gravity that. So I thought it was a\nlittle bit rude of him to to basically\ndrop a bombshell. Don't use an IDE. But\nlike I think it perhaps what he's trying\nto say is that you you don't need to\nedit code. You don't need to edit code.\n>> Yeah. Because you definitely want to see\nthose diffs and and and to be honest\neven cloud code is integrated within\nVisual Studio Code or whatever IDE you\nrun it. Every other ID is a V VS code\nfork anyway.\n>> Um so so it it's really nicely\nintegrated like it opens up the de for\nyou. You can clearly see it. those\nthings still need a proper and and what\nanti-gravity does really well is and I'm\nstill learning but it gives you like a\nproposal and I was like great like I\ndon't see where I need to click but then\nthere was a small button at the top\nwhich is like review and then you can\nlike highlight which they show I've seen\non the product demo and you can\nhighlight like here it made an\nassumption I say well this is a wrong\nassumption and then I feed back the it's\nlike a PR review you can just highlight\ndifferent sections and put a comment on\nthat\n>> it's like a different take on that whole\nplan mode include cuz I really like plan\nmode in the sense that it's like\nprompting you this this that like making\n>> now it's new right now now when it's\nplanning it goes like I have a couple of\nclarify questions and it it asks those\nquestions to you which is something that\nspeckit also did and now they kind of\nbuild it into cloud code like it goes it\ngoes off into a planning agent which is\nrunning Sony 4.5 goes through your code\nwith the requirements and comes back\nwith like a plan and some clarifications\nand it asks you like I have five\nclarifying questions and then you answer\nthem and you submit it and then comes up\nwith a plan which is a very nice uh\nexperience.\n>> Yeah. I mean I'm more CLI gang because I\nfeel like you know moving between the\nkeyboard moving like ABC like I can be a\nlittle bit faster cuz the ide can be a\nbit clumsy but it's it feels like we're\nalways going to go back we it feels like\nwe're going we're in this golden age\nwhere it's like terminal claw code. it's\nprobably going to last a few more months\nand then then they all go back to some\nIDE uh you know noob land or something\nlike that\n>> if they can address I guess the heart\nlike the problems that people have with\nIDs I know a friend of mine really likes\ncursor and he swears by cursor it's\nmostly front end maybe that's why I\ndon't know u but like another thing that\nI really like when you were saying about\ncurs um cloud code um terminal based\nview Gemini CLI did a big upgrade on\ntheir terminal all um you can do Ctrl S\nnow to go into selection mode and select\nthings and copy paste them and the\nscroll experience they say we fixed the\nflickering like you know cloud code\nstarts to disco um Gemini CLI has this\nnew way of of scrolling I found it slow\nmy machine is not slow but when I was\nscrolling it was sometimes a bit laggy\nbut if it fixes some of the like\nscrolling problems because if you're\nreading an LLM and it puts out a message\nand it scrolls all the way back down and\nyou have to go back to where you were to\nlike the thinking. It's so annoying.\n>> These little things are like so\nimportant, aren't they? Like that.\n>> Well, Gemini is doing a good like I used\nit two weeks ago. It was horrible. I\nposted it. It was on LinkedIn and I was\nlike that was a horrible experience.\n>> We were living in a golden age where\nlike this this competition between\nGemini and Claude. I don't know where I\nI I did use codeex the other day, but\nlike I was I was flabbergasted because\ncodeex doesn't have like support for\nproject based configuration and things\nlike this.\n>> Yeah. No, you Yeah, you want the prompt.\n>> I mean, how easy is that a feature to\nimplement? Like\n>> horrible.\n>> And you don't have a shell also like you\ncan't exclamation mark. And I've tried\nto search how do I run terminal shell\ncommands in inside codeex and it's like\nyou can't um which is\n>> Codex is basically off the map at this\npoint. I mean what?\n>> Yeah. Which is but then OpenAI says okay\nwe give Codex uh JGBD 5.1 CEX Pro to\neveryone. Right after Gemini was\nannounced Gemini 3. They go like hey\neveryone access to this now. [laughter]\n>> But I mean I don't really see the value\nin I mean I'm a clawed 4.5 gang still.\nI don't I don't get anything out of uh\nopen AI because like that that's the\ntrouble like people I think a couple of\nchats ago you were saying that you you\nput on auto but I'm I'm now thinking\nlike no I need claw 4.5 or or this is\nnot going to work\n>> auto\num like you you let it like auto approve\nand\n>> well auto choose the models like I'm\nchoose I want to choose the model\n>> yeah I also change um for Gemini CLI\ndefinitely I don't want it to go into\nflash. So, I don't choose it to I don't\nlet it choose. I I think that's mainly\nwhy I was having so many frustrations\nwith Gemini CI because they were going\ninto Flash.\n>> So, I mean like would you like if you\nwere ranking the models, would you say\nClaude is still top or would you say\nGemini is three 3 is now Eclipse?\n>> It's very hard to to say because my\naccess to Gemini 3 has been quite\nlimited. Like I said, um I haven't tried\nit in preview mode on on the paid\nsubscription of Gemini CLI. I'm using it\nin anti-gravity free. So, um\n>> I think I think you can assume you got\nthe you got the uh tasty experience\nthere.\n>> Yeah, I did some really cool stuff. Um\nbut again, like I don't I'm not doing\nbenchmarks cuz I find this is the\nhardest thing for me to make an opinion\nabout these things is I I Okay, so\nbasically what happened to me this week\nwas\n>> benchmarks are always like weirdly weird\nand manipulated. I think I think it it\nis that to go on fields basically.\n>> I don't think so because it's so hard to\nto basically I saw some Reddit posts and\npeople were like I gave all three models\nthe same prompt. This is how how they\nfared. I think that's a valid thing but\nI don't have time for that because like\nwhat happened to me was I I promised to\nget something deployed um by this by\ntoday like two hours ago. uh supposed to\nfinish it and I started on Monday and\nthen I realized I kind of underestimated\nit as usual as all software engineers do\nall the time [laughter]\nand maybe maybe not all just me then I\nguess um but\n>> I get it wrong.\n>> Yeah. So, so then what happened is I I\nhad to get things done and I was like\nwatch watching my weekly budget on\nentropic carefully because I cannot run\nout of tokens when I wanted to send it\noff.\n>> It's like a drug, isn't it? It's like,\noh, I check my supply. Yeah, I I kind of\nchoose what jobs I what I I will do\nmyself and like I don't let the model do\nsome stuff. But if I wanted to do like a\nheavy troubleshoot going across a 100\nfiles, I'd let the model do that, right?\nUh it's going to be a lot faster than me\ntrying to do it. If I have to rename a\ncouple of files and and and and do\nthings like that, I'm not going to say,\n\"Yeah, go ahead and go do that and\nwaste, you know, a million tokens\nrenaming files or or or you know,\nreading a whole file and then outputting\nthe same file into a new directory.\"\nThat's ridiculous. Yeah. So anyway, I\nwas kind of hitting close to the limits\nby by Wednesday and there was all this\nspeculation about like Gemini coming\nout, these batting screenshots getting\nshared. It was pretty cool to and funny\nto see all of that, but I was like\nbetting on it that it come out and then\nI have access to a free LLM on top of\neverything.\n>> And so\n>> the moment it came out, I literally have\nlike oh and I also have the cloud code\nweb version and I thought what you know\nI never tried it. I have $250 credits\nthere. Uh, and I thought given the API\ncalls a day for me, easily around $100.\n>> So, you have a different credit set for\nthe different\n>> Yeah. So, so with Entropic subscription,\nyou you get your cloud code access, but\nthen they give everyone that has a\nsubscription, depending on their tier, a\nnumber of credits. So, like if you're in\na prom max 200, whatever, you got like\n$1,000 to try out their web interface.\nSo, you can go to cloud.ai/codes AI/ uh\ncode and it's a web version of cloud\ncode. So you don't have all of your\nCLIs, you don't have like your\ncredentials, everything there. It just\nhave access to your git repo and it can\ndo some tasks. And I was like, I I want\nto try out a new um interface like a\nReact library of components. Uh and I\nwas like, you don't need any tools for\nthat. So I have $250 credits there.\nGiven the amount of credits I spend a\nday, $100, I think in three days, um I\nwill be able to spend $250. I I again I\nthought that this was going to be like\nAPI because the API is charged very\nheavily whereas you pay $20 a month but\nit telling me that I'm using over like\n$600 of API calls. That's how the tool\ntracks my calls and says this is how\nmany you are actually spending if you\nwere actually paying for every API call.\nSo So yeah. So so 250 I thought was\ngoing to be over in a minute, right? And\nit literally spent $8 only and it\nfinished. Why? Why is it because is it\nbecause the web one is more efficient?\n>> I don't know. Maybe it's because it's I\ndon't I I have no idea why the web was\nso efficient.\n>> So, are you are you on the max plan or\nthe pro plan?\n>> I'm on the pro. I pray $20 a month. I I\nI'm I'm diversifying, right? I have put\n$20 in OpenAI, $20 in, and $20. And just\nto reiterate what you were saying, so\nyou have you're on like a weekly limit\nby the sounds of things for the\n>> pretty much every provider gives you um\na 5 hour session token budget and then a\nweekly token budget. Before they only\ngave you 5 hours session token budget\nand then people were running it and\nsharing keys and they were just\nmaximizing it um by by having pools of\nkeys and so now they put uh like weekly\nbudget um which basically equates to\nabout 10 sessions that you 10 5 hour\nsessions.\nBesides like you know tracking your your\ntokens and your credits, have you been\ntrying to make your your prompts more\ntur? I mean I think we I think we agreed\nthat that MCP sucks. So\n>> yeah,\n>> have you dropped you you don't use any\nMCP servers?\n>> I I just run MCTP on my cloud\ncoordinates has zero MCPs connected.\nMaybe it's because you just updated.\n>> What other token optimizations have you\nbeen making?\n>> Okay, so\nI find these prompts are so difficult to\nget right unless you are running an eval\nsuite that evaluates your use cases to\nto make sure that the prompts still work\nwith the model and all that. I I I don't\nwant to write them myself. I don't want\nto maintain them myself. So I'm using\nspec kit and I've customized it a tiny\nbit. I removed anything that says you're\ngonna write out everything uh into a\ndifferent markdown file. I'm gonna make\nsure that you use uh beats Steve's thing\nto do the the issues, right?\n>> Be kit and and Steve.\n>> Yeah. And and it's going all right. I've\ntested it out. I I started recording. I\nsay this every time we talk like I have\ngot a recording, but it's like I'm still\nnot happy with it. [laughter]\nUm but yeah, it's going all right.\n>> Oh, by the way, can you can you take\ntake the framing out? It auto frames\nyour your face all the time.\n>> I don't know how to do that. Uh it's\n>> Are you Are you on me last time?\n>> I think I think it's called center\nstage. You just click the green icon and\nyou turn off center stage.\n>> Uh it's on Zoom.\n>> I'm not too sure. I think it's I think\nit's a a Mac feature actually.\n>> But where do I disable it then? Because\nI'm on a Zoom call. [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Well, in in my in my in my Mac OS\nmachine, I have this green icon when\nwhen it's like showing the usage of the\n>> and then [snorts] you just click the\ngreen icon and\n>> enter stage.\n>> Oh, it was not on.\n>> Now it's Now it's off. Now it's on.\n>> Okay, there's something.\n>> Maybe. Okay, maybe go video settings. I\nIt's probably in video settings\nand zoom then. Yeah, it's zoom. Of\ncourse.\n>> Zoom doom doom.\n>> Video settings.\n>> Yeah. Autoframing. New. Turn that off.\n>> Video settings.\nVirtual background appearance.\n>> It's It's an appearance.\n>> Autoframing. Oh,\nokay. It's off. Wait. My video is off\ntoo now.\n>> Okay. It stops, right? Hopefully.\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay. But you were saying do you like\nhow do you keep your prompts st\nyour token usage down\n>> cuz like I'm like for example when I'm\nworking with\n>> uh Claude\nI need to give quite a lot of context\ncuz I'm working on a huge code base to\nbe honest and like I'm never too sure if\nit's like looking through my git logs.\nUm, I I know it kind of shows the\nthinking, but I'm like it doesn't like\nevery stage when it does the thinking,\nuh, it doesn't really give a good\nfeedback about how many tokens it's used\nor what it's actually consumed. So I so,\nso I'm always in this like gray zone of\nlike am I using my tokens efficiently or\nnot? But\n>> so there is this\n>> Yeah,\n>> there's this one person ship hu I think\nshe wrote a book about AI cookbook or\nsomething. She posted on LinkedIn a\nscript that parses through your cloud\nlocks, like your cloud code locks\nbecause, so this is interesting. When\nyou run cloud code, it stores all of\nyour conversations on JSON files in\nsomewhere home directory or somewhere,\nright? Including every single\nscreenshot. So if you take a screenshot\nand you paste it, that gets checked some\nu uh what's it called? Uh B 64 encoded\nand written down into this JSON file. So\nthey she said no not she some people\nsaid that there were like gigabytes of\nof of logs in there but maybe if you're\nreally curious about your token usage\nyou could try and she posted a script\nthat she did to parse it and it\nbasically in her case she wanted to look\nat how many times does um a tool use or\na command fail for example it tries to\nread the file and says I can't find it\noh I'm in the wrong directory I need to\ngo up a directory and so on right and\nshe says is like she analyzed how many\ntimes which commands failed and then she\nupdated her cloud autom to like specify\nlike if like focus on this focus on this\n>> there's definitely like people who are\nstarting AI consultancies right now and\nI can't help but think that would be\nlike a key tool some key tooling in your\nAI consultancy like you would you you\nknow if you're trying to upskill a team\nyou would want these logs or you would\nwant to run your your tool over those\nlogs\nto better uh train to make people better\nat using the AI.\n>> So I think this is a very good\nobservation that the fact that as an\nengineer we must know how to use these\ntools. Using these tools is not easy.\nthey changes so fast. Um, and there's a\nlot of\nAI slop being generated as solutions\naround these tools.\n>> Like the the signal the signal and noise\nis pretty intense.\n>> Actually, come to think of which which\nReddit are you on? because I I posted\nlike a genuine AI question on the VS\nCode Reddit and everyone was replying to\nme like I was like they didn't even\nunderstand what I was saying.\n>> The VS Code doesn't sound like somewhere\nyou would get I I'm usually on the\nentropic um on the LLM devs. There's so\nmany. I I have no idea. Like sometimes\nand but Reddit also suggests posts that\ndo not belong to any subreddit that\nyou're subscribed to, but because you\nvisited one Reddit, it will sub um it\nwill suggest these post because they're\nsimilar to what you normally look at. So\n>> usually if I see something nice, I I\nsubscribe to that uh subreddit and it's\nlike cloud code, cloud dev, llmdev. So I\nlike a whole list over time.\nBut but Reddit as as a platform seems to\nbe the the best one for you still.\nYou're not in you're not one of these\ndiscord disco bunnies. Nitro\n>> course is a bit like slack where you you\ncan have like a thousand slacks\nconnected and you don't remember. You\ndon't know what\n>> so busy so noisy.\n>> Also I have like agents of AI uh AI\nagents AI agents AI gamedev AI prompt\nprogramming.\nSo you you just hop between them and\njust just try to I mean\n>> it's on my front feet usually sl\nartificial\nartificial intelligence.\n>> The other person I the other person I\nlike to follow is is Simon Willis. Do\nyou ever like check out his blogs? I\nmean he blogs about AI like three times\na day almost.\n>> You shared it with me, didn't you? You\nshare me a blog post of him.\n>> Yeah, I like I like his work a lot. He\nand the thing that blew me away about\nthe Gemini 3 release is that he was\ntalks he he has his like own unofficial\nor official test of drawing a pelican on\na bicycle and the Gemini 3 did actually\na really good job compared to all the\nother ones. [snorts]\n>> There's also Chpt Coding and Chpt Pro\njust I thought those and yeah and Cloud\nAI cloud cloud code.\n>> So you're in like 20 Reddits. Oh my god.\nYou're you're living. You're you're\nyou're deep diving, man.\n>> No, I'm only listing the AI related\nones. Not [laughter] the other one. Not\nthe one.\n>> Cursed AI. Oh, no. Not Not that one. Not\ncursed.\n>> What about all the Don't you have any\nother interests like uh kite surfing or\nwhatever the thing?\n>> I'm not listing those.\nUm,\n>> I did did you see that thing on hacker\nnews about\nuh Europe relaxing their GDPR rules\naround uh AI? And um when I looked into\nthe comments, most most people sort of\ninterpreted this as a victory for\ncookies. So we don't have cookie banners\nanymore in Europe. It's funny, right? Uh\nthis whole cookie thing. But but coming\nback to the the the Simon Willis uh test\nof asking you to draw a pelican on a\nbike. Um we were talking earlier about\nlike benchmarks that that people run and\nI think that's a type of benchmark right\nthat's that's interesting that other\npeople um you know evaluate a model\nagainst um there was something\nuh I forgot because\nyeah usually I also just go off of like\nwhat other people say about like I've\ngiven if this test definitely if they\nare providing like receipts right if\nthey're saying here's is a repo. Here's\nthe assignment. Here's how they did.\nThis is what I saw. And then also if\nit's not like overexaggerated and\nrepeated cuz then it's like clearly AI\ngenerated and it's so painful to read\nthrough because it just repeats itself\nand you're like, \"Oh my god, can you\njust get to the point?\"\n>> That's actually a good telltale sign of\nAI. Sometimes it repeats, doesn't it?\nSo, that's funny because a lot of\nsubreddits um immediately ban a post if\nit has too many emojis cuz it's like\nclassic AI to generate emojis or m\ndashes and things like that.\n>> So, um yeah.\n>> Yeah.\nWhen I'm using Claude, I I I get it I\nget it to give me the solution and then\nwhen I validate it's working and then I\nfeel like I have to go through this\nuh step or stage or phase where where\nI'm basically saying less code, suck\nless,\nmake it more tight\nbecause it's\n>> Yeah. So it's pretty verbose by default.\nSo with the crunch that I'm under for\ndelivering something right now, I have\nand you were saying earlier you have a\nreally large code base and and you then\nwent on to say that it's very hard to\ncontrol how much token it's using and so\non. But when we go back to the very\nlarge core bait part um when you said\none of the issues I have I I just give\nit like a really big like seven-year-old\nGolang monor repo that I adopted like\nforked and added my own features on top\nand usually hacked them in. So, it's\nsuper messy code and I'm always like a\nlittle bit, you know, reluctant or I\nalways try to just find the different\npaths. I kind of know the codebase where\nit needs to go and change things and I\nwas like, I don't know. I'm going to do\nthis myself. But then I tried\nanti-gravity Gemini tree. It's a really\nlight 7-year-old codebase and it pretty\nit was I didn't have to give it anything\nlike I didn't have an agent. MD or\nanything like that and I said like look\nI I'm adding a new CLI. So the root\nright now main.go is at the root but we\nneed to move it refactor it so that the\nthe CLI are separate directory so we can\nmint or build the different binaries\nfrom it and and then we need to like\nhave a shared interface between those\ntwo binaries because one will write\nfiles on this the other one reads it. So\num where like I suggest we put it here\nthere I went a bit back and forth with\nHGBT on the web actually while in the\ngym which is pretty cool. You can just\ntalk and then you know brainstorm and\nthen I took the prompt gave it to the\nanti-gravity and it did an amazing job.\nIt did a really good job. And in terms\nof code, the test suite on that repo is\nquite extensive. I went in, I wrote my\nown tests in the in that one area. So,\nit's kind of like a golden.\n>> How do you write your test your in Go\ntests or what?\n>> Yeah. Um,\nit's funny because when I first started\nworking with this repository, I was very\nsurprised by their test approach. They\nhave like this golden files approach\nwhich is kind of very more popular now\nas snapshot testing when they just\n>> Oh, yeah. Um, Hashimoto talked about\nthat.\n>> I think you shared me a post or or it\nwas on Reddit.\n>> Hashimoto did a did a call did a talk\nback in 2007 of how they wrote no 2017\nof how they wrote Terraform and how they\nwrote wrote their test suites and he did\ndifferent testing mechanisms and then I\nsaw he did a newer one uh\n>> it was linked in the same YouTube video.\nSo I I I looked at the new one as well.\nVery interesting. But that's how the\ntests were written. So they were all\ngolden tests there. It's a directory\nwith all the poss like different\nscenarios of of the config file, which\nis ugly YL. I hate Yaml, but anyway,\nit's a like I said, seven-year-old\nthing. It uses a YAML file as an input\nfile. So, I just added a couple new\nfields in the config, and then I\nactivated those fields in the test uh in\nthe test data. I ran the generate all\nthe golden files. I reviewed it if it\nmakes sense. And then I just let uh\nGemini and the LLM do its thing. No\nmatter like the code I I saw like\nthere's a whole bunch of lines there and\nit's like duplicated and I committed\neverything and I said like hey can we\nlook at this and clean this up and it\nsays done it's cleaned up. I ran the\ngolden test fail error. I was like okay\nthere's something wrong because you\nduplicate like all of these additional\nlines are here that shouldn't be there\nand then the LLM says oh yeah my\nrefactor did not take into account this\nedge case and that add case. And I just\nwent like revert everything. I stick to\nthe commit. I [laughter] don't care my\ntests are passing. Um, I'm not going to\nbother too much. Again, under crunch, I\ncan understand that over time. Um, it\ncan result in a horrible spaghetti code\nand hard to maintain problems.\n>> So, it's kind of like the balance.\nClassic tech.\n>> Speaking of reverting a commit, I'm very\nnervous about letting AI make a commit.\n>> No. Yeah, I didn't revert to commit. I\non stage like reverted all the changes\n>> cuz sometimes claude\n>> last commit\n>> I feel takes some liberties because like\nI don't want it to uh do get commits. I\nshould put that\n>> absolutely not. No,\n>> I should put that in my claw. MD, but\nsometimes it does it. I'm like dude\nstop.\n>> Well, so I am very reluctant to let the\nLLM do a commit. I usually I usually\nstage the files and then I let I I\nprompt the LLM and then I look at what\nit did against the stage files and if\nI'm happy I then stage additional files.\nSo that's like I I should be committing\nmore aggressively myself but I'm just\nstaging files until I'm happy and I know\nthat things work and then I want to do\ncommit because I like my commits to\nwork.\n>> What is your workflow? cuz like for me\nit's like I um I'm using VS Code at work\nto be honest but but if I'm if I'm at\nhome I'm using claude code and then I\nhave another terminal where I'm like\nchecking the things that it does and\nthen in that terminal I'm also doing get\nads but I'm just curious if you are some\nin turbo lazy get mode or something.\n>> Yeah, so I have I have VS Code and I use\na shell the terminal in VS Code uh to\nrun cloud code which has an ID\nintegration. So that means cloud code\nwill open files into VS code to to show\nthe diff. If I didn't allow it to to to\nmake changes itself.\n>> Uh also I don't know if it always\ncaptures it but if you select something\nthen when you do a prompt it will say\nand you have also the selected so it\nreads your\n>> Yeah. Um and then what I do is I stage\nfiles that I like know that I'm happy\nwith the changes it made. Um just in the\nUI on the left and you're just gonna\n>> Yeah, I st but when I do the commits I\nalways do lazy get because I used to use\nG g I used to like sign my commits and\nfor some reason it doesn't I I don't\nhave it now with my latest laptop but\nI've got the habit now to always commit\nthrough the terminal um because the\n>> so you stage in VS Code and then you\njump into Lazy G to commit.\n>> Yeah. Yeah,\n>> it seems a bit more audible, but uh\n>> no. Um\n>> I I kind of like the VS Code commit\nbecause it does the automatic commit\nmessage summary.\n>> H you know um\nmy commit messages are kind of like just\nusually one headline of the feature or\nthe chore or the fix and then some\ncomments. Usually I look at the stage\nfiles that I look at like I go through\nthe files on the left while I'm looking\nat like oh we also added this oh we also\nadded that and then I just um yeah it's\nconventional commits and and some\nmessage body um but that's my usual\nworkflow\n>> but but then when you were saying\nearlier we're afraid of letting it\ncommit but when you work with cloud code\nweb and I I just like told it here's my\nrepo um integrate this new react\ncomponent library to replace my custom\ncomponents that that are kind of bad\nthat you wrote by the way. [laughter]\nUm, and then cloud code just created a\nbranch and of course it has the only way\nto get its work is by it committing and\nit was committing all the time and uh it\nwas pretty cool. I just pulled the\nchanges to my local and then made some\nchanges, pushed it and\n>> I guess that's like a that's like the\nthing I want to control. I can get yes\nor no. I can get yes or no.\n>> Oh [snorts] my god. So with the with the\nPR workflow that I'm setting up the\nrelease workflow now I'm I'm I'm doing\nrelease please with um with go releaser\nand I want the PRs to be merged uh\nsquash merged merged so no matter how\nmany commits it did on the branch it\nwill all become one commit when the PR\nis merged.\n>> Right. Right. Right.\n>> And that works well with with like\nrelease please to find what has changed\nand then it creates a release PR keeping\ntrack of every uh PR merge that\nhappened.\n>> Yeah. I mean when I'm devel I mean I was\ndeveloping like a Terraform workflow\nyesterday\nI I kind of wish that I could have got\nAI to do it but it was one of those\nthings where this [clears throat] a this\nworkflow was part of all these other\nworkflows and these all these other\nsecrets so you could only trigger it\nthrough GitHub workflow. So I was going\nreally really really slowly because I\nwas like get commit uh you know - a - m\nfix uh and and git push and then and\nthen triggering a workflow.\nOne good thing is that I got AI to to be\nable to read the the workflow error log.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then it can help me iterate on that\nthing. But it's still it was slow to\niterate and it was uh yeah\n>> CI/CD is always slow.\n>> That's why you need you need project\nlike earthly or what's it called? Dagger\nfrom the Docker Solomon.\n>> I've been I've been dipping into Dagger\nbut I never got much out of it. I mean\nhave you got any joy out of\n>> Did I say Docker Solomon? I meant\nSolomon hikes from Docker. Yeah, I\nhaven't.\n>> [snorts]\n>> So the I really like the idea behind\nDagger.\n>> Um because Doc Solomon says\nwe failed. If Docker is just a runtime\nfor containers, Docker failed um because\nthe idea was to improve the the\necosystem dev ecosystem, right? um\nDocker Docker Mac uh is basically a\ntransparent way of um getting things to\nwork on your machine and that their\nfocus was always dev tooling.\n>> Not super transparent to be honest, but\nyeah. Okay,\n>> that was their idea, right? The whole\nidea of um cloud when they released\nDocker, their internal container stuff\nwas dev tooling and they really\noptimized the dev workflow, you know, of\nbuilding and having it run across\ndifferent machines, right? build chip\nrun was always uh\n>> their their moto right um and so with\nDagger says I'm focused on the dev\nworkflow like CI/CD is horrible\nexperience we want to be the ability to\num reproducibly have our CI/CD pipeline\nand at the same time there was\nearthly.dev dev and there was another\none as well that were trying to do the\nsame thing\n>> but but but I mean they must have failed\nbecause I don't know anyone who's doing\nthis stuff locally everyone GitHub\nworkflows have won the day\n>> and uh I mean I have this really\n>> this is a horrible experience um but I\nhad the same with AI though it's really\nnice I used the GitHub CLI did you is\nthat how you integrated with the with\n>> Yeah yeah yeah I have this like MCP\nsnippet where I just expose the the\nactions tool tool set because the MCP\n>> is too big\n>> is too big from GitHub.\n>> So this is where I do few shop samples,\nright? I I basically push my commit to\nthe PR the the workflows run and I I go\ninto a cloud code. I run the shell. I\nsay GitHub dash uh or GitHub PR check\nnumber three. And then it shows these\nare all the checks that run and these\nsucceeded. This how how much they took.\nThis is a job uh description or the link\nto the job ID. Um and then you just go\nuh GitHub CLI um PR or is it run view\nand then you can do either run id or or\nwith the argument flag d- job and you\njust pass that job from that PR check in\nthere. And when I first show to cloud\ncode I do these commands myself. So it\nsees the output and you can you can do\nd-lock failed and whatever. Then it\nstarted using jq to like you know JSON\noutputs to parse through things. Um, but\nit was I don't know. It did things that\nI thought wasn't really necessary. But I\ndon't need an MCP. I don't need\nanything. I'm just showing it the GitHub\nCLI command\n>> and then it just goes in a loop. It just\nlike, oh, I see it's failing here. Oh, I\nsee this problem.\n>> So, I'm in I'm in that team showing\nGitHub what to do. But like\n>> not repeatedly, not every time, all the\ntime.\n>> My my colleague my colleague asked u\na good question in a sense. is like he\nasked like what do I uh I need to use\nthe GitHub CLI what should I use the\nGitHub MCP\nor some other approach and then\nbasically I chimed in and said like well\nthe GitHub C MCP sucks because it's too\nverbose and it wastes your tokens but if\nyou use the GitHub um API or CLI sorry\nif you use the GH CLI you have to tell\nit how what to use. So my my colleague\nis a bit of a noob.\n>> I I think to be honest he wasn't he was\na little bit confused by what I was\nsaying like you have to teach\nuh GHLI you have to you have to teach\nthe the the\nbetter way is to teaching the AI how to\nuse the command. I mean that kind of\nblew his brain.\n>> Cloud skills are full right?\n>> I need Okay, then I need a skill to use\nthe GitHub CLI. That's a good\n[clears throat] weekend project. That's\na good weekend project.\n>> For sure there's one.\n>> For sure there's one.\n>> There's actually people that are writing\nLLM like agents to create skills and you\ngive it a couple of prompts of what it\ndoes and then it will explore the CLI\nand it will write an a like an agent\nskill which I think is a bit dumb right\nuh but like if it works it works. The\nwhole idea of the of cloud skills is\nprogressive disclosure. So you start\nwith like the first basic flows and then\nif you need more do this, if you need\nmore, do that. And then cloud is\nsupposed to like parse through it and\nand and progressively\nread more to like be able to do more.\nAnd and yes, that should be the way that\nyou don't always have to show how to use\na GH CLI every time, but you\n>> You're right. You're right. I should\nhave thought about that cuz I think my\ncolleague just was thinking I was an\nidiot or something like that. Like\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I need to I need Do do\nyou have you created any skills?\n>> No, I've only like played with the beats\nskill, right? But I don't like I\nintegrated it so it's living somewhere\nin my I think it's in your home\ndirectory.\n>> The the problem is in my world like I\nhave my personal claude code space which\nis fun but daytoday in my in my\nworkplace I'm using VS code and VS code\ndoesn't support skills. I believe\n>> they they have something in speckit they\nhave like they have a different way now\nto expose different agents sub agents\ninto your VS code as well when when I\nlook at the specit latest presentation\nfrom from the guy who who uh is like one\nof the main advocates on YouTube he\nshowed how they have like integrated\nspeckit into vs code settings like\ncopilotcopilot/s\nsettings.json JSON or something and they\nhave like declared all of the agents\nthat the specket provides. So then when\nyou are in the chat window of VS code\nyou can switch between these agents and\none of them is like the speckit plan\n>> better at VS code or something like\nthat.\n>> Look at the the speckit YouTube video\nchannel and then one of the latest\nvideos he shows how how they they are\nthey are exporting the LLM specket\nagents into VS code. So I think if you\ncan do that, you have dedicated agents,\nmaybe there's a way to like have the\nagent skills as well. Um cuz again like\nthey are constantly feeding off each\nother, right? One one company brings\nsomething out, another one copies it.\n>> Oh, sorry. I'm getting distracted. My\nwife is messaging me about the school\nrun.\nWhat time do you have to go back to work\nin 20 minutes or something?\n>> Yeah, something like that.\nYou said earlier something about um when\nyour colleague asked and teaching it how\nto use ah um I think that's where if you\nare a terminal like somebody who likes\nto live in the terminal tools like cloud\ncode kind of feels very cool because you\nare then you already are used to create\npull requests using gh right you already\ngo ghbrr create-fill\nwhatever u you push your branches from\nwith git so you're you're not someone\nthat goes to to the web and then clicks\non a button to create and so and so on.\nRight?\n>> So that's where I think that transfers\neasily into these other\n>> going back right back to what Steve Jo's\ntalk was about was that like he was\nsaying that the statistics in companies\nwhere people are adopting AI and they\nare are are by all measures uh becoming\nmore productive and then there's the\nsenior staff engineers who go who who\nwho there there people in a company who\nare not adopting it.\n>> So what do you do with those people who\nare not adopting it? And to be honest, I\nsee that in my workplace. It's like I'm\nusing AI like uh like like you, I\nsuppose, and I see the benefit, but\nthere's some there's there's there's\ndefinitely uh members of my team who are\njust completely not interested in in\npicking up these new workflows. I'm\nlike,\n>> so I had I I went to a Q Q&A conference\nback in June and one of I did I was\ninvited on the panel and one of the\naudience questions was exactly this like\nas a team lead because QA and and and\nand LLMs it's quite a big a big changing\nthere right automation of of LLM\ngenerating test cases and all sorry\nautomation of of tests and generating\ntest cases and test data um so one of\nthe the people there was like how can I\nhelp or ensure everyone within the team\num picks up on these LLMs um and and the\nreply from the the panel members and\nsome some somebody worked at Singapore\nAirlines and he says we we create a\nprompt database we do regular brown bags\nwe we um you know we share people with\ndifferent workflows on on how it helps\nuh but at the same time when you're\nsaying like there's these senior\nengineer who is really reluctant to to\npick us up I think maybe you need\nsomeone of those in your company, right?\nMaybe you need someone. Uh, and that\nthat makes me think of a Reddit post I\nsaw on the DevOps subreddit, I think\nthis week, which was like, I'm so\nfrustrated. Everyone in my team is using\nLLM and I'm like the only one that's\nactually doing manual reviews of all\nthese PRs and I'm reading all these PRs\nand I'm like the I feel like I'm the\nonly one like commenting on these lines\nof code and saying like why is this like\nthat and so on. So, so um\n>> but still I mean maybe yeah, I see your\npoint. There's definitely\ndefinitely like an argument to be made.\nOkay, here's another problem that I hit\nout of work, right, is that strictly\nspeaking, we have a co-pilot license\nand I think there's basically the JBT\nmodels exposed there,\n>> but I want to use I want to use Claude.\nSo, VS Code gives me an ability and to\npaste in an API key for uh Claude as\nwell as Google Gemini and all the other\nstuff.\n>> But then you then you have this\nconundrum like hm the company hasn't\nexpressly approved this model and that\nmodel.\n>> Can I use it?\n>> Yeah. And and then furthermore, there's\na whole uh topic around um the you know,\nwho's going to pay for this.\n>> Um\n>> I feel like these are unresolved issues,\nbut maybe maybe let's get back to I\nthink I think I need to do the school\nrun. It's it's it's icy out here. My\nwife doesn't want to drive in that in\nthe\n>> I need to take the kids to school. Okay.\nYeah. Um just on that point right for me\ncurrently\nI'm I'm using I'm this is I think if\nyou're in in infrastructure and DevOps\nI've always said these are to me are the\nmost interesting fields to be in because\nit's the same everywhere. It's not\nsecret sauce. It's not this the the the\nthe secret terraform everywhere.\n>> What do you mean?\n>> Yeah. I mean the ideas of running\ninfrastructure on the cloud and setting\nup uh you know observability dashboards\nand monitors and CI/CD pipelines it's\nnot a core differentiator or secret\nsauce of an organization it's not like\nsomething that's propri saying yeah\nright the skills are transferable\n>> exactly so I used to coach or work with\nproduct engineers and then try to\nconvince them like why do you you know\nbother with working purely on business\num um business feature uh tickets, user\nstories and so on. I isn't it way more\ninteresting to be in the DevOps space\nand then be like exposed to something\nthat's you much more transferable\nbetween organizations when you want to\nchange as well. Um but that was then\nuntil I got into a position where DevOps\nwas really seen as a cost center and\nthen you are like completely blocked to\ndo any type of refactoring because why\nwould you want to do this and and um you\nknow\n>> this sounds like my life right now to be\nhonest.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and I was always\nsuper happy to be DevOps. Uh but then\nyou have the ne negatives which are like\num you know unthankful because nobody\ncares everything's running. and people\nare wondering what is this guy doing\nuntil there's an outage and then\neveryone's you know breathing down your\nneck and why is it down [laughter] and\nthen uh I had a few companies where\nthere was like a celebrity uh but that\nwas a pretty dire state right because\nthe whole website was down and you\nmanaged to recover it within x amount of\ntime and then you're like\n>> this hero [laughter] this hero thing\nlike yeah you saved the day dude you got\nthe website back up maybe it shouldn't\nhave been down in the first place for\nChrist's sake\n>> yeah it depends also if you're the fire\nstarter right if you're the ones putting\nfires all the time that you are actually\nthe fire starter [laughter] but yeah\nyeah yeah um yeah it's that was\n>> industry isn't it\n>> so that's where I think using LLMs for\nDevOps related tasks is easier because\nit's like it's not so proprietary and a\nlot of the things I do I actually take\nan open source library and I I work on\nadding features there so I'm saying to\neveryone like hey don't I I this rule\ndoesn't apply to me because I'm taking\nan Apache 2 library I'm putting it as an\nopen source fork and all of my cloud\ncode generated code uh is not related to\nany company data. But but like do you\nthink like for example do you think\nGoogle uh trains\nthe Gemini model on their own\nproprietary uh code base? I I I think\nthere would be afraid that there would\nbe excilation of data, right? That I\nthink there's clear cases of of\n>> So basically like you so if you went to\nGemini say create me a Google search\nengine, they would it just wouldn't\n>> I'm pretty sure that there's a whole\n[snorts] like actors trying to\nexcfiltrate as much. I mean they all\nthey always say that Quen when it was\nlike trained and like how many% of the\ntotal cost that OpenAI and other\ncompanies spend quen AI from China was\ndeveloped with like a fraction of the\ncost and they say it's trained on\nsynthetic data. trained exfiltrated uh\nfrom all of the um you know open AI\nmodels and so on right so so there's\ndefinitely organizations trying to\nexcfiltrate any type of proprietary\ninformation from companies and I think\nGoogle must separate the training data\nfor\n>> but I don't think other companies have\nthat luxury I think that I think the um\nI mean\nokay\nobviously people are trying to keep\ntheir own proprietary source code um\nsafe and obviously their their private\nGitHub repos are not being indexed\nby um by a model. But nonetheless,\num,\nyou know, I'm sure if you ask a CTO of\nof a company with a big code base and\nthey and and you asked and you said to\nthem like, uh, would you like a model\nthat knows about your coding style and\nyour uh, and your existing code? They\nwould jump at it, right?\n>> Yeah, there's companies doing that,\nright?\n>> So, there's a bit of a a chasm there,\nlike how do you bridge that? So, so\nsource graph is had very has a a lot of\ninteresting YouTube videos because\nsource graph positioned themselves as\nthe originally enterprise solution for\ncode like search right so they have big\ncontracts with enterprises for you know\npropriety self-hosted deployments um to\nindex the code and for you know JP\nMorgan whatever huge clients to to for\ntheir software engineers to quickly find\num code or relevant um microservices for\ncertain functionality across all of the\ncode base right so [snorts] then they\nthey are also having their LLM on top of\nthis now like Annie I think it's called\nor uh\n>> okay so there there are products for\nthis okay\n>> yeah yeah um and and a lot of yeah when\nearlier\n>> I mean I mean GitHub GitHub needs to do\nthis next seriously I mean like\n>> so when we talked about I'm using VS\nCode and um and then I'm not sure which\nmodel I have access to I can give it an\nAPI key and what's the contract like\nwhen I talk to someone from GitHub he\nwas visiting in Vietnam. He told me that\nthey have very strict um contracts in\nplace with enterprises and how they are\nusing the code. And also when you sign\nwith with the with Microsoft and on the\nGitHub enterprise, you decide like\nfor example, one of the risks that\ncompanies have is that they get um a\nlawsuit for copying code, right? if they\nuse an AI, how can GitHub copilot\ndeployed across all of these people that\nare using the AI guarantee that I'm not\ngenerating code that is proprietary or\nthat is copyrighted and that's now in my\ncodebase. Like imagine it's a GPL and\nnow I have to open source everything. Um\nso so that's a risk. So so Microsoft has\nthese contracts in place that says first\noff it it sources different it generates\nsolutions\n>> mess up like what stops one of my team.\n>> Hold on. You haven't listened how they\nsolved it yet. So he told me that they\nare generating different code solutions\nand then they do a cross check to any\nlike existing and licensed code in their\ndatabase and then they're you know\nrejecting anything that could be and\nthen they're sending you only the one\nthat is passing all of that. Sometimes\nco-pilot gives you code and then\nsuddenly gets removed says like this is\na copyrighted code I can't give you that\n>> and then the second thing is what he\ntold me is that Microsoft actually will\nsponsor you in if there's a lawsuit if\nyou if you prove that this code is\ngenerated by co-pilot and Microsoft will\nbe part of the lawsuit that's why he\ntold me like part of the contract\nstipulates that if your company gets um\ngets what's it called um\n>> extra lawsuit yeah no gets a lawsuit\nagainst you like um then\n>> Oh, okay. Because you're using source\ncode that might be interpreted as being\nproprietary.\n>> Yeah. So, so basically you said it's\nvery hard but he was saying that's one\nof the things Microsoft has to convince\nenterprise users that they are\nprotecting. seems like a a good tact but\nbut I mean at the end of the day that's\nthat's Microsoft that's GitHub they they\nknow about your proprietary code but\nlike\n>> like how how about this scenario like\nthere's a new there's a new edit there's\na new IDE let's call it anti-gravity and\nsomeone like oh wow this can help me do\nmy job and then he just launches on his\nproprietary codebase and then all of a\nsudden\n>> so that's where Um it's it's important\nfor organizations to put in place AI\npolicies and and and books um what's it\ncalled? Runbooks or guides because if if\nthis happens, right, it means that the\nuser hasn't really been informed um or\nor [snorts] he's like maliciously doing\nit. He knows that it's not allowed but\nhe's going to do it or he's not know he\ndoesn't know about the risk and he just\ninstalls it and then he hasn't been\ntrained. Right? So, so in my\norganization we had um to sign a\ncontract that says that I will not copy\nproprietary and this is we had to first\nlearn what is propriety and confidential\ninformation. who like no be no no be uh\nno before trainings and then also sign a\ncontract saying like\n>> you know if they find out that I do this\nbut I'm not doing it [laughter]\n>> then I will be\n>> like one thing in in some workplaces\nthat I like to do is to encourage the\nuse of code spaces do you know GitHub\nGitHub code space\n>> yeah I haven't used it but yeah\n>> but the cool thing about that is that\nlike the code is there and it's not on\nyour local machine and it's there's a\nnice clear division And\nyeah, I'm just finding it hard like\nbecause\nlike yeah, like we we like I I we have a\nspecial API key with u with a particular\nvendor. I'm not going to say who, which\ngives us private confidentiality with\nthe code that we use on it. But then\nit's not clear if we have permission\nfrom the client if we can\nuse uh\n>> snippets of the like like to be honest\nI'm not even using\nthe code base right it's it's like what\nyou were saying with the Terraform it's\nlike uh I mean not Terraform like\ninfrastructures code it's like maybe I'm\ntrying to debug a GitHub workflow that's\nno different to anyone else's Terraform\nplan and apply and I would want to use\nthat that that paid for model and and\nand then I'm always a little bit like hm\nI'm not sure I can do this because\ntechnically what I've just copy and\npasted here is proprietary code but it\nisn't really and yeah all this ambiguity\nmakes makes the whole experience a\nlittle bit crappy\nright um but but I was going to say that\nyou are somebody that then worries about\nthat either because you've been trained\nor informed about these risks. Um so you\nknow that's because your company has put\nin place policies so that you are\nknowledgeable about these things right\nif if you look at many other people\n>> but the policies are not clear they they\njust create FUD you know what I mean\nlike and FUD is worse than\n>> fear uncertainty and doubt\n>> which is a crypto term like crypto\n>> I mean [sighs]\nhow many how many companies have really\nclear policies with AI like you can only\nuse this model and that model and that's\nit. I don't I don't think I've seen any\nI don't seen I don't think I've seen\nany.\n>> I think that's where your organization\nis providing you with access to AI and\nmy organization is giving us access to\nGitHub copilot. I I am naming it. Um but\num that also at the enterprise level the\norganization level they control which\nmodels the users have access to. In our\ncase, we can only select the ones that\nthat they have approved in our\norganization.\n>> Okay. In in code in VS Code basically,\nright?\n>> And I only know this I don't manage\nthis, but I know this because somebody\nin in the chat asked like, \"Hey, they\njust released Sun 4.5. We can only\naccess four. Can you give us access to\nthis new model and then somebody has to\ngo into it and then give access to it?\"\n>> You say that and I think it's I think\nwhat you're saying is true, but at the\nsame time, VS Code gives me the option\njust to paste in an API key. So like\n>> Yeah. I don't know like I'm not using\nthe VS code one and again I'm I'm\nexcusing my not using it by only working\non on repositories that are not private\n[laughter]\nand um and basically if I do something\num yeah anyway so so I don't know if I\ncan add the key but earlier you also say\nif you use VS code in the first place\nright um the guy who was working at\nMicrosoft was telling me that the plugin\nsystem at the time which is more than a\nyear ago had no control about like VS\nCode did not have any any constraints on\nwhat the plug-in could read. So a\nplug-in could just read anything from\nyour your your folder, right? And I\nthink they have improved that now\nbecause now whenever you install an\nextension, it tells you like, \"Watch\nout. Do you trust these people?\" And\nthat's all they did basically.\n>> Yeah. I mean, yeah. V extensions.\n>> Yeah. Like\n>> Yeah. I mean, that's a good that's a\ngood uh segue because, you know, people\ngo like, \"Oh, did you get approval to\nuse these model thing like that?\"\nThey're like, \"It's there. I mean, I\ndidn't uh you know, if they wanted to\nprohibit it, they Yeah, but you should\nget approval before you use anything.\nIt's like, how many extensions do you\nhave installed? You're like, how many\ntools do you have installed? Did you get\npermission for every one of those\nextensions or tools that you get have\ninstalled? I mean, you're being\nridiculous. So,\n>> and that's one of the things the\nMicrosoft guy told me as well. This is\nsomething that they as the uh copilot\nextension implementation uh provider he\nhe said it was actually GitHub acquired\nby Microsoft right he said that they\nguarantee that it will only read files\nthat you have open in the editor it will\nnot read anything from the disk so um\nthat's the type of guarantees that you\nlike I don't know that until he told me\nright it's probably somewhere in the\nfine print I don't know about the MD\ngravity right now uh from Google I just\ninstalled it I gave it the code base\nwhich is open source uh to work on and\nit probably read everything anyway and\nit must be able to because if it can't\nit wouldn't wouldn't have been able to\ndo such a good job to find exactly where\nit needed to change what right\n>> yeah\nwell okay I I wanted to end the the\nconversation on something a little bit\nmore positive but um I guess the\npositive thing is that the all these uh\nwe're living in a really exciting time\nreally I'm really digging the fact that\nI'm alive I mean it's amazing I mean\nlike the future's is is bonkers, isn't\nit? It's incredible.\n>> So, I agree absolutely with what you\njust said, but my second the second part\nabout the future is where I'm like, for\nhow long? [laughter]\nFor how long?\n>> I do feel I do feel this stuff for $20 a\nmonth.\n>> I'm probably like in\npositive. I'm I'm in that that maybe the\nplateau camp like I do feel like we are\nhitting a surge cuz some people say like\noh this thing is just going to go like\nthis like like like forever and I'm like\nI think the models are improving but not\nas fast as you would think cuz the\nmodels I I feel have a limited training\nsupply right they're not they're not\ngoing to invent new information that\nit's going to plateau essentially by how\nmuch good stuff there is for it to be\ntrained on, right?\n>> If it's like software,\num\nwhere it's just an ever expanding gas,\nit takes up whatever resources are\navailable. Um I think with with AI right\nnow, it's taking up every resource it\ncan in terms of electricity and power\nand um you know, GPU capacity. Um, it's\nvery hard to predict because\nbefore the release of Gemini 3 this\nweek, everyone was like, \"What happened\nto Google? Gemini 2.5 Pro, me included,\nin March was great. Now, what's what\nreally have to like be really good? Is\nit delay?\" Because is there a disarray?\nThere was so many articles about cuz I\nsearched Gemini 3.0 release pretty much\nevery day to find out if there was any\nnews and every article you're like,\n\"When is the next?\"\n>> Yeah. because I had to get things done\nby Wednesday and I was like hoping\nGemini 2.3 zero release I get some free\ncredits.\n>> Your claw tokens or your claw budget was\nalmost expired.\n>> Every article I read before Wednesday\nwas like\n>> the truth and the disarray within\nGoogle. Google is completely unable to\nhandle it. Google has lost has lost it.\nYou know what is about these TPUs?\nthere's a TPU supposedly rolled out and\ngive them the edge across the world but\nthe infrastructure is delayed that's why\nGemini 3 is delayed and blah blah blah\nbut then Gemini came out and everyone's\nlike Google did it Google is the market\nleader look at at um how Google Gemini\n3.0 zero is like this high in the\nbenchmarks. Does that give like um what\nthey called it again? Because you have a\nmuch small smarter model within your\norganization and you have full access to\nit. That means that you have the ability\nto accelerate much faster than the other\ncompanies, right? So with the\nannouncement of Gemini 3 and in how good\nit is compared to GPT 5.1 and 74.5 that\ngives them not just like a small edge\nthat gives them a massive edge because\nit means internally they can have like a\nhundreds of Gemini trees running and\nimproving on the product.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean like I definitely\nfelt that uh maybe as long as a year ago\nthat that all of a sudden like Google\nSheets and uh Google Docs basically got\na whole bunch of new features and like\nprevious 5 years\nGoogle Docs and the Google Suite felt\nfrankly unmaintained. And I was thinking\nto myself like why all of a sudden is\nthere so many cool new features\n>> after they lay off 30,000 people or\nsomething. [laughter] Why suddenly\nGoogle Sheets have all these new\nfeatures? H\n>> well okay there could be other\nmitigating factors but I did I did I did\nbasically occur to me that like maybe\nthey have some technology that we don't\nhave or something or or do you think\nit's the fact that they laid off people?\n>> No. No, no, no. I was just correlating\nwith the fact that they laid off people\nand and so it must be llams or\nsomething, right? How can you suddenly\nhave a whole bunch of new kettle of fish\n>> after you lay off all these people?\n>> Yeah, let's let's get back to that. I I\nthink I've got to wind this up. Anyway,\nit's been it was a great chat. I'll\nupload it. I'll share the link and I ask\neveryone to\nplease like and subscribe and share the\npodcast.\n>> And and and and comment below like if we\nsaid something stupid or something\nbetter if we could have said something\nbetter or then let let us know that\n>> this comment will be Google did not lay\noff 30,000 people. It was more like\n100,000 people.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. We're hoping to get in intelligent\ncomments. To be honest, the comments\nsection is always not as good as I hoped\nit to be. All right.\nSo, you're instigating right now.\n>> I wouldn't I wouldn't take it.\n>> I speak the truth only.\n>> I wouldn't I wouldn't take it.\n>> Okay. See you. See you, Vincent. Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:20]\nOh man, it's it it's these weeks have flown by and there's so many developments. Uh I don't know where to start even like like uh Okay. What do you think of the Gemini 3 Pro thing? Have you managed to get on it? >> Um I'm using anti-gravity and I got some Gemini 3 Pro for free, so obviously my limits are pretty bad. Um, and it has been I mean I started I'm like a day I'm shifted in in like 12 hours compared to when they announced it, right? But that also means that I'm online when most Americans that try it out are offline. So I I have to fight with other Southeast Asianbased people which not everyone is following the latest Gemini tree release. So the first day I had a decent amount of work done by Gemini 3. It was pretty good. The experience in anti-gravity was also pretty nice. It gives you a couple of new like things reviewing files. I haven't used cursor so I wasn't too familiar with like a proper IDE integration. I've given up on Visual Studio Code Copilot for a while already. I'm purely in CLI land. So using an IDE and you know it's it's [snorts] been a long time before the LM was like rewriting the whole file and you had to watch it rewrite and you go like no don't change that. Ah and now it's it just instantly pops up with like um this has changed this has changed you can review this file. So it's pretty pretty cool. Yeah >> because um I don't know if you saw that link I sent you yesterday to some AR AI summit with Steve Jger and uh >> it was it was live right? I I didn't watch it live >> because I like to fast forward and so on. So, >> well, I I just someone shared the link and I just tapped on it and like Steve Jger was giving his uh his his spiel live and uh it was pretty good. It >> It was a pretty good >> I definitely want to see that now. You told me that he's talking about it. I see a lot of improvements on the >> but like one of his like he says like, \"Oh, I needed to give a hot take and here's my hot take. You're a bad engineer if you use an IDE by the end of the year. Thought >> by the end of the year. Oh, that's a hot take. >> Interesting. >> Like but like an IDE. >> Is he sponsored by Warp now? [laughter] >> Well, the thing is the AI summit was like sponsored by I think Google and Google was like anti-gravity this, anti-gravity that. So I thought it was a little bit rude of him to to basically drop a bombshell. Don't use an IDE. But like I think it perhaps what he's trying to say is that you you don't need to edit code. You don't…\n\n[slide:2] [5:00–15:39]\nnow to go into selection mode and select things and copy paste them and the scroll experience they say we fixed the flickering like you know cloud code starts to disco um Gemini CLI has this new way of of scrolling I found it slow my machine is not slow but when I was scrolling it was sometimes a bit laggy but if it fixes some of the like scrolling problems because if you're reading an LLM and it puts out a message and it scrolls all the way back down and you have to go back to where you were to like the thinking. It's so annoying. >> These little things are like so important, aren't they? Like that. >> Well, Gemini is doing a good like I used it two weeks ago. It was horrible. I posted it. It was on LinkedIn and I was like that was a horrible experience. >> We were living in a golden age where like this this competition between Gemini and Claude. I don't know where I I I did use codeex the other day, but like I was I was flabbergasted because codeex doesn't have like support for project based configuration and things like this. >> Yeah. No, you Yeah, you want the prompt. >> I mean, how easy is that a feature to implement? Like >> horrible. >> And you don't have a shell also like you can't exclamation mark. And I've tried to search how do I run terminal shell commands in inside codeex and it's like you can't um which is >> Codex is basically off the map at this point. I mean what? >> Yeah. Which is but then OpenAI says okay we give Codex uh JGBD 5.1 CEX Pro to everyone. Right after Gemini was announced Gemini 3. They go like hey everyone access to this now. [laughter] >> But I mean I don't really see the value in I mean I'm a clawed 4.5 gang still. I don't I don't get anything out of uh open AI because like that that's the trouble like people I think a couple of chats ago you were saying that you you put on auto but I'm I'm now thinking like no I need claw 4.5 or or this is not going to work >> auto um like you you let it like auto approve and >> well auto choose the models like I'm choose I want to choose the model >> yeah I also change um for Gemini CLI definitely I don't want it to go into flash. So, I don't choose it to I don't let it choose. I I think that's mainly why I was having so many frustrations with Gemini CI because they were going into Flash. >> So, I mean like would you like if you were ranking the models, would you say Claude is still top or would you say Gemini is three 3 is now Eclipse? >> It's very hard to to say because my access to…\n\n[slide:3] [15:18–25:58]\nworking with >> uh Claude I need to give quite a lot of context cuz I'm working on a huge code base to be honest and like I'm never too sure if it's like looking through my git logs. Um, I I know it kind of shows the thinking, but I'm like it doesn't like every stage when it does the thinking, uh, it doesn't really give a good feedback about how many tokens it's used or what it's actually consumed. So I so, so I'm always in this like gray zone of like am I using my tokens efficiently or not? But >> so there is this >> Yeah, >> there's this one person ship hu I think she wrote a book about AI cookbook or something. She posted on LinkedIn a script that parses through your cloud locks, like your cloud code locks because, so this is interesting. When you run cloud code, it stores all of your conversations on JSON files in somewhere home directory or somewhere, right? Including every single screenshot. So if you take a screenshot and you paste it, that gets checked some u uh what's it called? Uh B 64 encoded and written down into this JSON file. So they she said no not she some people said that there were like gigabytes of of of logs in there but maybe if you're really curious about your token usage you could try and she posted a script that she did to parse it and it basically in her case she wanted to look at how many times does um a tool use or a command fail for example it tries to read the file and says I can't find it oh I'm in the wrong directory I need to go up a directory and so on right and she says is like she analyzed how many times which commands failed and then she updated her cloud autom to like specify like if like focus on this focus on this >> there's definitely like people who are starting AI consultancies right now and I can't help but think that would be like a key tool some key tooling in your AI consultancy like you would you you know if you're trying to upskill a team you would want these logs or you would want to run your your tool over those logs to better uh train to make people better at using the AI. >> So I think this is a very good observation that the fact that as an engineer we must know how to use these tools. Using these tools is not easy. they changes so fast. Um, and there's a lot of AI slop being generated as solutions around these tools. >> Like the the signal the signal and noise is pretty intense. >> Actually, come to think of which which Reddit are you on? because I I posted like a genuine AI question on the VS Code…\n\n[slide:4] [25:37–36:17]\nrefactor did not take into account this edge case and that add case. And I just went like revert everything. I stick to the commit. I [laughter] don't care my tests are passing. Um, I'm not going to bother too much. Again, under crunch, I can understand that over time. Um, it can result in a horrible spaghetti code and hard to maintain problems. >> So, it's kind of like the balance. Classic tech. >> Speaking of reverting a commit, I'm very nervous about letting AI make a commit. >> No. Yeah, I didn't revert to commit. I on stage like reverted all the changes >> cuz sometimes claude >> last commit >> I feel takes some liberties because like I don't want it to uh do get commits. I should put that >> absolutely not. No, >> I should put that in my claw. MD, but sometimes it does it. I'm like dude stop. >> Well, so I am very reluctant to let the LLM do a commit. I usually I usually stage the files and then I let I I prompt the LLM and then I look at what it did against the stage files and if I'm happy I then stage additional files. So that's like I I should be committing more aggressively myself but I'm just staging files until I'm happy and I know that things work and then I want to do commit because I like my commits to work. >> What is your workflow? cuz like for me it's like I um I'm using VS Code at work to be honest but but if I'm if I'm at home I'm using claude code and then I have another terminal where I'm like checking the things that it does and then in that terminal I'm also doing get ads but I'm just curious if you are some in turbo lazy get mode or something. >> Yeah, so I have I have VS Code and I use a shell the terminal in VS Code uh to run cloud code which has an ID integration. So that means cloud code will open files into VS code to to show the diff. If I didn't allow it to to to make changes itself. >> Uh also I don't know if it always captures it but if you select something then when you do a prompt it will say and you have also the selected so it reads your >> Yeah. Um and then what I do is I stage files that I like know that I'm happy with the changes it made. Um just in the UI on the left and you're just gonna >> Yeah, I st but when I do the commits I always do lazy get because I used to use G g I used to like sign my commits and for some reason it doesn't I I don't have it now with my latest laptop but I've got the habit now to always commit through the terminal um because the >> so you stage in VS Code and then you jump into Lazy G…\n\n[slide:5] [35:56–46:36]\nintegrated it so it's living somewhere in my I think it's in your home directory. >> The the problem is in my world like I have my personal claude code space which is fun but daytoday in my in my workplace I'm using VS code and VS code doesn't support skills. I believe >> they they have something in speckit they have like they have a different way now to expose different agents sub agents into your VS code as well when when I look at the specit latest presentation from from the guy who who uh is like one of the main advocates on YouTube he showed how they have like integrated speckit into vs code settings like copilotcopilot/s settings.json JSON or something and they have like declared all of the agents that the specket provides. So then when you are in the chat window of VS code you can switch between these agents and one of them is like the speckit plan >> better at VS code or something like that. >> Look at the the speckit YouTube video channel and then one of the latest videos he shows how how they they are they are exporting the LLM specket agents into VS code. So I think if you can do that, you have dedicated agents, maybe there's a way to like have the agent skills as well. Um cuz again like they are constantly feeding off each other, right? One one company brings something out, another one copies it. >> Oh, sorry. I'm getting distracted. My wife is messaging me about the school run. What time do you have to go back to work in 20 minutes or something? >> Yeah, something like that. You said earlier something about um when your colleague asked and teaching it how to use ah um I think that's where if you are a terminal like somebody who likes to live in the terminal tools like cloud code kind of feels very cool because you are then you already are used to create pull requests using gh right you already go ghbrr create-fill whatever u you push your branches from with git so you're you're not someone that goes to to the web and then clicks on a button to create and so and so on. Right? >> So that's where I think that transfers easily into these other >> going back right back to what Steve Jo's talk was about was that like he was saying that the statistics in companies where people are adopting AI and they are are are by all measures uh becoming more productive and then there's the senior staff engineers who go who who who there there people in a company who are not adopting it. >> So what do you do with those people who are not adopting it? And to be…\n\n[slide:6] [46:16–52:16]\npropriety self-hosted deployments um to index the code and for you know JP Morgan whatever huge clients to to for their software engineers to quickly find um code or relevant um microservices for certain functionality across all of the code base right so [snorts] then they they are also having their LLM on top of this now like Annie I think it's called or uh >> okay so there there are products for this okay >> yeah yeah um and and a lot of yeah when earlier >> I mean I mean GitHub GitHub needs to do this next seriously I mean like >> so when we talked about I'm using VS Code and um and then I'm not sure which model I have access to I can give it an API key and what's the contract like when I talk to someone from GitHub he was visiting in Vietnam. He told me that they have very strict um contracts in place with enterprises and how they are using the code. And also when you sign with with the with Microsoft and on the GitHub enterprise, you decide like for example, one of the risks that companies have is that they get um a lawsuit for copying code, right? if they use an AI, how can GitHub copilot deployed across all of these people that are using the AI guarantee that I'm not generating code that is proprietary or that is copyrighted and that's now in my codebase. Like imagine it's a GPL and now I have to open source everything. Um so so that's a risk. So so Microsoft has these contracts in place that says first off it it sources different it generates solutions >> mess up like what stops one of my team. >> Hold on. You haven't listened how they solved it yet. So he told me that they are generating different code solutions and then they do a cross check to any like existing and licensed code in their database and then they're you know rejecting anything that could be and then they're sending you only the one that is passing all of that. Sometimes co-pilot gives you code and then suddenly gets removed says like this is a copyrighted code I can't give you that >> and then the second thing is what he told me is that Microsoft actually will sponsor you in if there's a lawsuit if you if you prove that this code is generated by co-pilot and Microsoft will be part of the lawsuit that's why he told me like part of the contract stipulates that if your company gets um gets what's it called um >> extra lawsuit yeah no gets a lawsuit against you like um then >> Oh,…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "Two infrastructure engineers discuss the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence tools and their profound impact on DevOps and software development workflows. The conversation centers on the release of Gemini 3 Pro, the ongoing competition with Claude 4.5, and the shifting expectations for modern engineers. They explore practical applications, such as refactoring legacy codebases and managing token budgets, while addressing the cultural and security challenges of integrating AI into enterprise environments.\n\n[slide:1]\n## The end of the IDE era\nThe discussion opens with a provocative \"hot take\" from a recent AI summit suggesting that traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) may soon be obsolete for high-performing engineers. The core argument is that the developer's role is shifting from manual code editing to a high-level review process. Instead of writing every line, engineers are increasingly using tools like anti-gravity and cloud code to review AI-generated diffs and proposals. This \"plan mode\" allows the AI to ask clarifying questions before executing complex tasks, which significantly improves the accuracy of the output.\n*“You're a bad engineer if you use an IDE by the end of the year.”*\nThe speakers note that while some developers still prefer the speed and control of the Command Line Interface (CLI), the integration of AI into the development environment is becoming seamless. New features allow for instant file rewrites and PR-style reviews within the editor, making the traditional process of watching an LLM slowly output code feel antiquated. The focus is now on providing feedback to the model's assumptions rather than manual syntax correction.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Comparing Gemini 3 and Claude 4.5\nThe engineers evaluate the current landscape of Large Language Models, specifically comparing Google's Gemini 3 and Anthropic's Claude 4.5. While Gemini has improved its terminal experience and scrolling stability, Claude remains a favorite for complex engineering tasks due to its consistency. In contrast, OpenAI's Codex is described as being \"off the map\" because it lacks essential features like project-based configuration and shell command support. The competition between these providers is seen as a \"golden age\" for developers, though it requires careful model selection.\nFrustrations often arise when models default to \"Flash\" versions, which are faster but significantly less capable for deep technical work. The speakers emphasize that choosing the right model often comes down to \"feel\" and real-world performance rather than public benchmarks, which are frequently perceived as manipulated or unrepresentative of actual engineering challenges. They highlight the importance of having access to the most advanced models, such as Claude 4.5, to ensure the AI can handle large codebases without losing context.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Token economics and prompt optimization\nManaging the cost and limits of AI usage is a critical skill for modern engineers. Most providers now implement weekly token budgets in addition to session-based limits to prevent account sharing and manage API costs. One engineer describes the experience of monitoring his \"supply\" of tokens like a drug, carefully choosing which tasks to delegate to the AI and which to perform manually to avoid running out of credits before a deadline. This involves a strategic balance between using the model for heavy troubleshooting across hundreds of files versus simple tasks like renaming directories.\nTo improve efficiency, developers are beginning to analyze their own usage logs. By parsing JSON files that store AI conversations and screenshots, engineers can identify where commands fail—such as the AI looking in the wrong directory—and update their instructions to focus on specific areas. This level of meta-analysis is seen as a key skill for future AI consultancies. The discussion also touches on the \"Pelican on a bicycle\" test, an unofficial benchmark used to gauge a model's reasoning and creative capabilities, where Gemini 3 reportedly performed exceptionally well.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Refactoring legacy code with AI\nA practical case study involves refactoring a seven-year-old Go monorepo using Gemini 3. The AI was tasked with separating CLI binaries and creating a shared interface, a task it performed surprisingly well despite the \"messy\" nature of the legacy code. The process relied heavily on \"golden files\" or snapshot testing, where the AI's output is compared against known good states. This approach allowed the engineer to validate the AI's refactoring efforts quickly, though it also revealed the model's tendency to miss certain edge cases during cleanup.\n*“I'm just staging files until I'm happy and I know that things work and then I want to do commit because I like my commits to work.”*\nDespite the AI's speed, the engineers express caution regarding automated commits. The preferred workflow involves letting the AI stage changes, which the human then reviews and manually commits via tools like LazyGit. This maintains a \"human-in-the-loop\" safety check, preventing the AI from introducing \"spaghetti code\" or edge-case errors that could lead to long-term maintenance problems. The tension between AI-driven speed and long-term code quality remains a central concern for senior engineers.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Cultural shifts and team adoption\nThe adoption of AI tools within engineering teams is uneven, creating a divide between those who embrace the new workflow and those who resist it. While some engineers see massive productivity gains, others—often senior staff—remain reluctant to change their established habits. This can lead to situations where a few individuals perform manual reviews on a flood of AI-generated code, creating a bottleneck. The speakers suggest that organizations should encourage adoption through \"brown bag\" sessions and shared prompt databases to bridge this gap.\nThe integration of AI \"skills\" or agents into tools like VS Code is seen as the next step in making these workflows more accessible. However, teaching the AI how to use specific CLI tools, such as the GitHub CLI (GH), remains a complex task. The engineers discuss the \"progressive disclosure\" of AI skills, where the model starts with basic flows and gradually learns more complex commands. This approach helps junior developers become more productive while allowing senior engineers to focus on high-level architecture and system reliability.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Enterprise security and the future of AI\nEnterprise adoption of AI is complicated by concerns over proprietary data and copyright. Microsoft and GitHub have addressed this by offering legal indemnification for Copilot users, promising to support customers in lawsuits if the AI generates copyrighted code. They also implement filters to prevent the output of known licensed snippets. However, many corporate AI policies remain unclear, creating \"FUD\" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) that can hinder innovation. Some workplaces use GitHub CodeSpaces to ensure that proprietary code remains in a controlled environment rather than on local machines.\nLooking forward, there is a debate about whether AI progress will plateau due to a limited supply of high-quality training data. While some believe the technology will continue to expand indefinitely, others suggest we are hitting a surge that may eventually level off. Regardless, the current ability of companies like Google to use their own advanced models internally gives them a massive edge in accelerating product development. The conversation concludes by emphasizing that despite the uncertainty and the potential for a plateau, it is an incredibly exciting time to be working in infrastructure and DevOps."
