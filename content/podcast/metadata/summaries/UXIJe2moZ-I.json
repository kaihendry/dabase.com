    "siteName": "YouTube",
    "content": "Transcript:\nThe following is a conversation with\nVincent Smith on the latest developments\naround Terraform.\nSorry, I I couldn't resist the Lex\nFriedman inspired introduction.\nWell, I know Vincent from uh Singapore.\nHe's he's out there somewhere in Asia.\nHe's a he's a thorough veteran of all\nthings infrastructure, as am I. I'm\nbased in the UK\nand an infrastructure engineer is my day\njob. What is an infrastructure engineer?\nI help run those software services that\nyou use. I sort of help uh provision\nthose cloud and manage and govern those\ncloud services usually AWS.\nAnd uh what one way to provision those\nresources is with a popular uh project\ncalled Terraform which fairly recently\nuh got bought by IBM and relicicensed uh\nunder like a commercial license. So the\nthing that everyone uses the terraform\nis now uh in a sort of a interesting\nplace and the conversation um that\nfollows is Vince and I just chatting\nabout it and hopefully you enjoy it.\nPlease comment below and um I will uh\ntry my best to answer all your\nquestions. Thank you.\n>> So what's the tea?\n>> What's the tea? So you had some you had\nsome juicy infrastructure gossip.\n>> Okay. So maybe some background like\nthere's quite a few companies built\naround Terraform.\nSome of them being Space Lift, M0, you\nknow, you know the whole deal with the\nthe licensing change around Terraform\nand um a lot of companies forking the\nlast uh Mozilla public licensed version\nof Terraform and then maintaining it as\na fork under open tofu. Right.\n>> Right. And um aside from those\ncompanies, there's also Digger. I'm not\nsure how much Digger.dev is involved in\nthis open TOFU effort. I'm not sure\nactually who are the founding companies\nbehind Open Tofu. Um the the the term\nTaco Terapform automation TA\ncollaboration CO and software. So Tacos,\nright? T A C O S Terafform automation\ncollaboration software.\n>> Okay. Okay.\n>> Okay. So a lot of this Terapform\nautomation and collaboration software\nexamples are Teraphform Cloud where you\npush code into Git and then it triggers\na a run of Terapform plan and apply. Um\nand and so Atlantis is a famous uh open\nsource tacos.\n>> Yeah, I I just have Digger open right\nnow and it looks like it just reminds me\nof Atlantis.\n>> Yeah, so Digger is an alternative to\nAtlantis with the premise being why do I\nneed a separate EC2 instance when I hub\na whole bunch of CI/CD runners. So what\nthey do is they give you CI/CD workflows\nfor um GitLab and GitHub actions and\nthen they simply have an orchestration\nAPI that those runner workflows can you\nknow be orchestrated with. So whenever\num a an event comes into the GitHub, it\nmaybe triggers through the orchestration\nlayer and the orchestration layer would\nthen dispatch uh dispatch uh GitHub\nworkflow. So it actually uses your\nGitHub runners that you may have\nself-hosted or that you are having part\nof your GitHub hosting to to run the\nterraform jobs, right? You don't have a\nseparate terapform instance. So\n>> so their view on how is is the minimal\nlike impact like the easiest fit into\nexisting uh company um workflows. So\nthey build digger in that uh frame and\nthen they mentioned like you know what's\nreally missing and a big problem with\nAtlantis as well is the ability to just\nmanage the orchestration. So Hashi Hashi\nconference happened last week where\nHashikov is going to make a lot of\nannouncements. So there was actually\nquite a lot of um things or news\nhappening around Hashik um from other\ncompanies trying to you know use the\nevent to also\n>> Wow, that must be such a cool event.\nAtlanta. Okay, cool.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yep.\n>> So So last year on Hashicon they\nannounced\nuh stack beta. I think the two years ago\nthey announced uh terraform stacks\nprivate beta and then public beta and\nnow it's finally ga general available.\nSo what is terraform stacks? Steraphhone\nstacks is basically the the ability to\ndefine multiple terraform states in one\nstack. So that they for example a common\nscenario is you have a network and then\nyou have a Kubernetes cluster and then\nyou have some Argo CD deployment that\nneeds to depend on that Kubernetes\ncluster right so you can\nthose are all all individual components\nright the network has to exist and\ncreate all the subnets private and\npublic subnets for the application nodes\nto be provisioned in. So the Kubernetes\ncluster can only be created after the\nnetwork has been created. So Terapform\nSTS will help you to orchestrate across\nmultiple terapform states.\n>> So this is something that is cloud only,\nright? They will this is not part of the\nTerapform CLI until the most recent\nrelease where you can actually use the\nTerraform CLI to query the cloud stacks.\nBut cloud stacks is cloud only except\nfor some CLI to get some information\nabout your stacks. But but wait a\nminute, Terraform must have had this\nfeature before to depend on another\nstack for another I mean you could you\ncan fish out values from another\n>> Yes, you can fish out values and I\nbelieve they just use workspaces and\noutputs between workspaces but they\ndidn't have a crossworkspace\norchestration uh um feature as far as\nI'm aware.\n>> What what does orchestration mean like\nlike a like a like a\n>> this coordination\n>> like depends on on things like this?\n>> Yes. like I want to provision a new\nenvironment and that environment\nconsists of a network, a cluster and a\ngithops controller and the uh network\nneeds to be created first then the\ncluster then the controller. Okay.\n>> So yeah\n>> so when you say orchestration I'm just\nlike mapping it into GitHub workflows.\nYeah. But okay carry on. when yeah when\nI say orchestration I mean like\ncoordination between different um you\nknow activities that need to be ran and\nand you know orchestrated you know the\nevents between them that trigger the\nactivities or actions to be\n>> executable something\nmaybe more like a make file in my you\nknow Dumbo brain you know\n>> a make file gives you a couple of that's\nmore like a task runner right a make\nfile gives you a couple of targets to\nexecute and then you you are the\norchestrator usually that says first I\nneed to run this make file has like some\nminimum orchestration\n>> well it has like files so you you you\nsay like you know I need this file food\nto be built before this file bar so so\nit it will run the target for fu but to\nbe honest make files are never quite\nused that way but uh anyway we're\ngetting distracted here so orchestration\nI'm I'm I'm all aboard on GA\n>> all right so there's been GA now great\num however\nA lot of these Terraform automation and\ncollaborations software or tacos have\nswitched to a resource under management\npricing mechanism where you're being\ncharged for every resource that um they\nmanage for you and so if you have a lot\nof Terraform resources then you are\ngetting a very big bill over time right\n>> yeah yeah I mean that's that's really\nevident in my current client with data\ndog I mean when when you look at each\nresource cost. It's cheap,\n>> but when you have a zillion resources\nand the sprawling cloud of which you\ninevitably do, it's really expensive,\n>> right? So, one of the arguments\nof um you know the advantage of of using\na a collaboration software like you can\nuse Atlantis, you can run it selfhosted\num but it doesn't really do cross tech\norchestration all this tech feature\ndoesn't exist. Um, so I've also\npersonally been thinking like how do I\nadd on orchestration on top of Atlantis\nfor example because Atlantis whenever\nyou open a pull request it will um\nidentify any GitHub um it will use git\nto identify any changes like based on\nthe pull request compare compared to the\nbase. It will identify which terraform\nprojects may have changed. It can auto\ndetect that or you can be very explicit\non how it needs to track which projects\nneed to be run and where those projects\nlive. Um and then Terraform will\nbasically try to run all of those\nprojects. If you want, you can auto\nplan. So every time a pull request is\nopened, it will auto plan any projects\nit believes that may have changed and it\nruns them all at the same time. So\nobviously if you make a pull request\nthat creates three different components\nand they depend on each other, then one\nof them will plan successfully, the rest\nof them will fail because the other\ncomponents don't exist, right? So you\nhave the ability to do some type of\norchestration if you manually um define\nor uh execution groups. So Atlantis has\nthe ability to say execution group one\nand then execution group two then\nexecution group three. A little bit like\nArgo CD uh deployment waves. Uh it's the\nsame same.\n>> Okay. Yeah.\n>> Uh it's execution order group.\n>> Okay. Wow.\n>> Yeah. So it's for ordering. And then uh\nabout two years ago another PR came in\nwhich was the ability to define\ndependency. So you uh which basically\nyou can use order group to determine\nwhen to run the which projects only\nafter a certain other projects have been\nrun. And then the dependency was that uh\nAtlantis would fail or bail if uh one of\nthe projects dependencies hasn't been\napplied yet. So it has a very basic\ntracking of of of a project. It says\nlike okay this one is planned this one\nis uh\n>> applied\n>> um and and if it tries to if you try to\nrun a plan and it and the dependencies\nhave not been resolved it will fail\nbecause it has these dependencies of\nother projects that must be um you know\nresolved first. Yeah. But in in reality\nthose two concepts don't really map\ndirectly to like the ability to\norchestrate like to say uh run this and\nthen run that right. Um because that\nshould be sufficient to just say\ndependency. You don't need execution\ngroup and dependency. treat it\nseparately. One is to make sure the\ndependency has been resolved. One is to\nmake sure that one\n>> I mean ordering is like very basic uh\nyou know you're you're on a maturity\njourney that that's when I see people\ndoing that that's like very basic. It's\nlike kind of manual but when you have a\na proper tool like any like make or\ndepend or or an orchestrator as you say\nthen it becomes\n>> spacelift or m0 they all have the\nability to do that even teragrant like\neven teragrant within the repository you\ncan define dependencies between your\nterafr grunt um you know states and then\nyou uh teragrant can do a run all uh to\norchestrate it so basically run\neverything in in in order so it\n>> it basically builds a graph\nuh across your different Terraform\nstates. So, so within a diff within a\nTerraform state, Terraform builds a\ngraph between the resources, right? this\nresource need to be created and then it\nthat resource depends on it and then and\nit does its own parallelization and like\nexecution and and sometimes you need to\nbe you need to terraform you need to\ntell terraform hey actually you know\nthere's like for example an API gateway\nwhen you create the API gateway and all\nof its integrations in AWS um if you\nthen try to trigger an API uh gateway\ndeployment if that if that uh actual\nintegration hasn't been resolved or\ndoesn't or the lambda hasn't been\nattached and you trigger the deployment\nit will fail AWS API I will say got it\n>> this gateway doesn't have a an\nintegration so it will fail and and in\nthat case there's no direct dependency\nbecause the deployment has a dependency\nimplicit dependency on the gateway\nbecause you use the gateway ID uh the\nAPI gateway identity so when you you use\nthat link terapform knows I need to\ncreate a gateway then I need to create\nthe deployment but it does not have an\nexplicit dependency between the\ndeployment and for example an\nintegration on the gateway so when when\nyou don't do that then um you get a race\ncondition. So it may manifest um\nsometimes it may not manifest right u\nbut but the right way is to really say\nlike okay this deployment also depends\non these other resources you know and\nyou have to explicitly say it depends on\nthis gateway integration with this\nlambda and so on right\n>> yeah got it\n>> so that that becomes very um that works\nreally well with terraform within a\nterraform state\n>> so terapform is amazing um in handling\nthese resource dependencies sometimes\nyou have to give it a little bit of a\nhint uh now from a higher level outside\nof the state. Um, creating dependencies\nbetween states adds a lot of like\nadditional orchestration overhead that\nmakes it difficult sometimes. Like one\nof the most common problem is I'm going\nto change my network for example and I'm\ngoing to change my output and now my\nsubnets are no longer a map of key value\npairs. Maybe they become an ordered list\nand then maybe I have another component\nwhich reads a key and then gets an error\nbecause there's no longer a map there.\nit's\nright I understand the complexity\n>> that happens um so why do people\nseparate everything right why why do\nthey create one state for the network\none state for the cluster and that's\noften because of like life cycle um or\nownership\n>> right\n>> yeah so a network usually has a much\nlonger life cycle than the clusters\nwithin or even the deployments on on\nclusters\n>> I mean I usually say blast radius to to\nto clients like that's why we have so\nmany goddamn stacks.\n>> Yes. Uh blast radius and um with that is\nalso for example if you use and again\nthis comes back to like a lot of\ndiscussions within the terraform space\nwhich is like do I always uh only apply\nafter I merge. So um you know only apply\noff the master branch or do I like do I\nallow people to run apply from a from a\nbranch and basically the branch is\nmodifying the states which is shared\nbetween the master branch and then if\nsomebody runs an apply then they may\nlike inadvertently undo my changes\nbecause my merged yet right\n>> I see that all the time in my current\nclient we have a channel called\nTerraform stack wars or something like\nthat people basically announce that I'm\ngoing to make a change to the monitoring\nstack or the networking stack.\nand then they create a branch and imply\nit in dev and uh of course people need\nto somehow lock it so that they don't\nstamp on each other\n>> right so Atlantis has a very good\nfeature there and a lot of organizations\nfollow Atlantis way of doing things\nwhich is as soon as you open a pull\nrequest and Atlantis runs a plan it\nbasically keeps a lock on that\nparticular state\n>> so if another pull request goes against\nthat particular state like Atlantis\ndetects a project and and tries to plan\nit, it will get an error saying, \"Oh,\nthis pull request number 34 owned by\nVincent owns the lock on this particular\nproject.\nThe lock is quite needs to be quite long\nlived because like\n>> as long as the PR holds the lock so it's\nin a database like like an object\ndatabase keeping track of the lock and\num and so basically until somebody goes\nin and clears the lock from that PR that\nPR holds the lock.\n>> Nice.\n>> Right. And that's because Atlantis tries\nto be deterministic. So when you when it\nauto plans it will write a plan on disk\nand when somebody approves it he will\napprove exactly that plan that run right\nand if something changes um for whatever\nreason if you if you try to trigger an\napply and you know Terraform tries to\nand this is a terapform feature right\nAtlantis passes the previously generated\nand approved plan from disk into the\nTerraform apply and then the Terapform\nwill immediately reject it if it\ndiscovers that something changed and the\nplan is no longer valid. So the plan has\nbecome stale. So then you need to like\nrerun plan to get an approval. It can be\n>> depending depending you can be flex. You\ncan say as soon as it you know the PR\nhas received one one approval it's okay.\nYou can use the GitHub approval\nrequirements um you know whenever a\ncommit is pushed maybe it invalidates\nthe PR. So you use the you know your uh\nversion control um gates on your pull\nrequest.\n>> Yeah.\nIt sounds like Atlantis has been\nevolving over the years that I I mean I\nhaven't used it. Uh so that sounds good.\nI mean does it have does Atlantis for\nexample have a feature where if you\ndon't destroy anything like you know if\nthen just approves\n>> that like some sort of policy is\n>> auto approval.\n>> Um\nthat's not actually no not that I'm\naware of. It's probably possible but it\nwould I mean technically everything is\npossible right but it would require a\nlittle bit of additional I don't have\nany um such setup currently\n>> but this is definitely like another\nrequirement that um people ask it's like\nwhenever like I want an auto approve or\nan auto deploy flow so I want Atlantis\napproval to automatically happen and\n>> yeah I mean I mean and there's probably\nthere's probably AI in the mix here you\nknow like\n>> you don't know I would avoid AI in those\nsituations to be honest.\n>> Well, I've I've been using Copilot in\nGitHub Copilot um as a reviewer in in\nPRs in in the team and I'm actually\nquite surprised how good it is in some\nways. It's it's better than any like I\nmean is it better it complements any\nlike linting tool and things like this,\ndoesn't it?\n>> We can go deeper on like all of the\nthings that we can do with context\nbecause this really relates to the tea\nthat I want to talk about.\n>> Okay. Okay.\n>> Okay.\n>> Oh my god. 20 minutes in. Yeah. So, so\nyou you'll have to edit this heavily,\nbut we've basically explained some of\nthe, you know, options because what you\njust mentioned is we have some manual\ncoordination to lock PRs. Atlantis does\nthat for you. Um, but this means that\nAtlantis locks the PR and then it has a\napply before merge philosophy and a lot\nof organizations are like this is\nunacceptable. uh you know trunk is the\nsource of truth and um we cannot have\nanything applied until it landed on\ntrunk that's where it should be\n>> merge uh okay\n>> yeah because Atlantis keeps the lock on\nthe PR as soon as everything is applied\nwithin the PR then that needs to be\nmerged as soon as possible needs to go\ninto trunk right because now the state\nfile reflects whatever is on that branch\nyeah and if that is not merged and\nsomebody you know runs Terafform from\ntrunk from their laptop without you know\nhaving this at\n>> I Atlant's lock is purely on the\nAtlantic side. It doesn't\n>> contentious but it doesn't it doesn't\nseem like such a big deal to me really\nbecause you're working.\n>> Yeah. So some organizations are very\nstrict and so some uh some workflows\nthey they say apply before merge is\nincorrect. It should be merge and then\napply. So my main I am from the Atlantis\nlike I grew up with Atlantis. that glad\nthis solved a lot of my problems and and\nfor me I have experienced many times\nthat the plan looks perfect but when you\ntry to apply it fails right for whatever\nreason because you know a terapform plan\ndoesn't really validate like\n>> yeah yeah yeah\n>> I guess I guess terraform crud reads\nonly the attributes and then does this\ninternal validation of like this needs\nto change and then um the actual ter AWS\nprovider may get an invalid response I\nmean to be honest I I prefer a workflow\nwhere we don't even plan because because\n>> plan doesn't catch probably I'm making a\ncrazy figure about AI it plan doesn't\ncatch like 80% of the the issues that\nyou might get when you when you're\ndeploying infrastructure. I mean it it\nit doesn't really help you move fast. Um\n>> okay right so so so there's just I\nwanted to highlight that Atlantis is one\nsolution. It lacks a lot of the\norchestrations, gives you a lot of other\nstuff. Um,\n>> and it's open source and it's it's it's\neasy. You don't have to worry about\n>> can run it on $15 EC2 instance. You can\ngo to the digger docs where they go into\nlike pretty good arguments against it\nsaying like, well, you know, it's never\njust one Atlantis instance. They have\nlike a a doc where they compare the\nproblems with Atlantis. I believe they\nsay uh Atlantis is never Yeah. compared\nto Atlantis. I like their arguments.\nIt's like it's never just one instance.\nWhere is\nI can't see it now. But there was or\nmaybe I I remember it from another um\ntacos. Uh\n>> but but since but since Atlas is just\ndoesn't is is not like cloud pricing. I\nmean that's a huge win in my book. They\ndon't even mention the price. I I talk\nto to friends of mine that are running,\nyou know, 10 thousands of Terraform\nresources of, you know, very big scale\nand when they look at any RUM quotes,\nit's just like blows up their cloud bill\nbecause it's it goes from I'm I'm paying\n$20 a month from a, you know, a decent\nEC2 instance running Atlantis or\nrunning, you know, on a Kubernetes\ncontainer. So, it's even less um, you\nknow, CPU memory usage and I can, you\nknow, so I'm not paying anything right\nnow. I'm paying like 20 bucks max and\nI'm going to be facing $10,000 a month\nif I switch to like the cloud just\nbecause I want that like additional\npolicy as code or I want additional\norchestration features or arbback like\nthat's not in Atlantis right you don't\nhave proper arback you can do like some\ncode owner setup with your GitHub PRs to\nyou know only validate that if that\nperson approves then it can be applied\nwe do some conf test in my organization\nwhere we we do invalidate like or we\nblock a PR if there's any changes to an\nIM policy so that the security has to\ncome in and review these changes to IM\npolicies for example. So we have some\nconf test like that\n>> some some routings going on.\n>> Yes and conf test is also um like\nhardcoded into Atlantis right you can\nAtlantis has their own workflows and the\ndefault workflows includes confest so it\nruns an OPA um policy against your um\nTerapform plan but if you don't want to\nuse confest you can use other OPA or um\nother scanners. I I don't think I've\neven used comp like like why is it\nclaiming to be\n>> secure by design and\n>> uh maybe because when you run Atlantis\nyou're running an EC2 instance that may\nthat has a lot of permissions like an IM\npolicy that has administrative like uh\npermissions and maybe that's like you\nyou are responsible for securing your\nAtlantis because your Atlantis in the\nend is the one that takes or assumes the\nprofile to make all the cloud changes\nand then that instance It's quite normal\nthough. That's pretty normal.\n>> Yeah, it's\n>> and so I mean it's\n>> because you're hosting an EC2 instance,\nyou need to like you can't make it\npublicly accessible, but it needs to\nreceive GitHub web hook. So it must have\nsome ingress path for\n>> conversely, I'm I'm assuming that if\nyou're using digger, you have to hand\nover the crown jewels to digger just\nlike CICD to to the ter.\n>> No, they don't. So, so they are purely\nlike the orchestration layer that just\ndispatches the the workers and your\nworkers are your CI/CD system. So, you\ncan you can have those hooked up to your\nGitHub like you have runners for for for\nstuff anyway, right? So, so basically\nthey hand off like\n>> I don't Okay. Okay. Let's let's get to\nthe the gossip then.\n>> Okay. So, so aside from Atlantis,\nthere's Digger, there's Spaceelift,\nthere's M0, there's Terot Team, there's\nquite a few. And so Digger has been\nposting these um thought experiments on\nReddit where they talk about the states\nmanager. What if a terraform\norchestration like Tacos wasn't a\nrunner? Like most of these like\nSpacelift, M0, they're all providing\nrunners um basically triggered by web\nhooks. But what if you decouple the\nrunner infrastructure and just focus on\nthe state management part? So the\nbiggest problem that we have because we\nare splitting states. Um the biggest\nproblem is how do we like manage the\ndependencies between states and and\nidentify you know if if one state\nchanges what else is impacted because\nfor example I make a change to my\nnetwork now I need to invalidate\neverything that depends on my network so\nit may need\n>> so so we we're go we're going back to\nTerraform stacks aren't we here if\nyou're talking about states\n>> it's kind of related to the stacks\nstacks capture the dependencies between\nstates but the argument from digger on\nReddit like the thought experiments were\nabout like let's imagine an API that you\nonly use it to define dependencies\nbetween your states and it gives you\nendpoints to you know identify any stale\nstates. So a state that needs to be\nreplanned because something it depends\non has changed. So basically track the\nedges, color the edges when outputs\nchange and then replan or like give an\nbasically give back a list of jobs to\nrun because there's these states need to\nrun, right?\n>> Color color the edges. That's an\ninteresting expression. Yeah.\n>> Color the Yeah. Um it literally what it\ndoes it's a a state multigraph because\nit keeps track of multiple edges between\nstates for each\n>> out. Where are these discussions\nhappening on terraform or something? on\nthe terraform subreddit which was like I\nthink posted around maybe June.\n>> Okay.\n>> So state management calendar edges I\nthink I'm I'm with you.\n>> Right. So so I was very interested and I\ntalked with um with with the the team\nbecause I'm building something that\nreally needs this state orchestration\nand not only the state orchestration but\nI need to hook into it because I\ngenerate terapform. So I want to be able\nto read the outputs and I want to be\nable to see what's the shape of an\noutput. So I want something that can\ngive me um or can help me track\ndependencies or outputs and then\nidentify what is the source of that\noutput and things like that. So I talked\nto them like hey um I want to know what\nyou guys like I'm interested to help\nbuild with this. So I had a call with\nthem and they presented to me uh\nsomething that was they were building in\nstealth at the time and they were just\nwanted to get some feedback and it was\ncalled open taco. Okay interesting. So\nthat was about like two weeks ago. Then\nnot much after Terra team the other\ntacos provider announced uh an\ninteresting project called state\ngraph.dev state graph.dev.\nYes. So terraform without the state file\nbottleneck. Like they their argument is\nbasically the the reason we are\nsplitting states is because we don't\nhave proper tools to manage our\nterapform state because the terraform\ntool is only able to manage a single\nstate. The real problem is if we were to\ncreate like a massive teralith basically\none big state where all of your\nenvironments are and then we improve the\nactual tooling around this single\nmassive state and we're able to like\nterraform apply uh slices of it and\nwe're able to you know control arbback\nof individual resources like we're able\nto track ownership and and approvals\nagainst the individual resources. we're\nable to solve a lot of the problems why\nwe are having this blast radius and and\nthese arguments.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I've been argument is\n>> yeah that I've been thinking this we\nneed like a monolithic\nkind of state\nthat problem.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So they announced like let's get\nrid of this state you know multi-state\nproblem. Um and at the same time you\nhave uh Tara Grant or Grunt Works\npromoting these uh kill the terit\nadvertisement or workshops. It's very\nfunny. My LinkedIn feed is like on one\nside Grunt Works you know advertising of\nkill the monolith uh kill the ter\n>> break\n>> breaking the ter\nworkshops and they're like um you know\nterits are killing you. You must have\nresponded like\n>> a monolithic terapform state.\n>> Well,\nno one ever does that but uh I don't see\nthe problem there.\ncompanies like Grunt works they're like\nconsultancy and they're going into a lot\nof places where people you know like in\nin-house develop their own terapform\nsetup and then they face all kind of\nissues and basically teragrant is quite\nextreme because when you use teragrant\nyou pretty much get one state per module\nso you build one module and then you\ninvoke that module and that's one state\nyou cannot like have multiple modules\nthis is a bit crazy right I mean if you\nimagine how small modules sometimes are\nI can tell you in a previous place I\nworked at we like three years of terror\ngrants and we had like 300 or 400\nterraform states. It was insane.\n>> So, so, so I don't understand. So, if\nthey do it in such a fragmented way,\nthen how can they claim that that the\nmonolithic terraform state is a problem?\n>> No, they're coming into organizations\nand they're saying, uh, we will help you\nbreak down your terror because all of\nyour problems are because of the terith.\n>> That's crazy to me, but okay.\n>> Right. And they have they also launched\na cloud product called Terra Terracale\nor Teragrant scale. So they they\nlaunched a product uh basically to\nmigrate you into and then orchestrate.\n>> Oh okay. So it's like a importing blah\nblah blah\n>> right. Okay. So so that was just an\nanecdote because I'm seeing on one site\num Terra team constantly posting about\ndon't break down your ter is not your\nproblem. The problem is the tooling. And\non the other side I have like grunt work\nsponsor saying we have workshops to help\nyou break down the term.\nYeah, I'm definitely in camp um state\ngraph. Definitely.\n>> Right. Yeah. So, so they hit hacker news\nuh front page the moment they posted\nthis and um they Yeah.\n>> Nine point. Oh, yeah.\n>> That one. Yeah. Like 13 days ago.\n>> That's quite respectable,\n>> right? And then they also got like the\nmailing like they they said they have\nhundreds of organizations interested.\nThey're looking for design partners to\nto help build out what people want from\na state graph and what it looks like.\nThey're even hiring Okamel developers,\nbut they won't train you. I try I asked\nthey said no, we don't have time to\ntrain you. Um, so you must know Okamel\nand then um they're building this their\nlaunch date, their road map is for\nquarter 16.\n>> Atlantis is written in what? Python, I\nguess, or something.\n>> Golang, a massive Golang source code.\nOh, nice.\n>> Quite complicated. I don't know about\nGolen for monolithic like\n>> it gets really complicated.\n>> It's not that comp. I love go.\n>> The problem with with Atlantis is that\nit's so ingrained into the pull request\nflow that everything is like based off\nthe idea that it's coming from a pull\nrequest event which is horrible. Like\nfor example, they try to add an API\nendpoint to run Terraform plans and it's\nreally painful because it like oh you\nhave a pull request, right? Where else\nare we going to run a plan on? Right.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's so\n>> okay. So but anyway, Atlantis is not\num sorry my my head space is in this\nwhole monolithic versus\n>> Atlantis doesn't really dictate how you\norganize your state. Yeah, you know has\nthis auto discovery to to find your hash\nyour terapform configuration files. You\neven have like integration with terror\nso that you can automatically like you\ncan let terror actually run the\nterraform across your like repository\nand then you can Atlantis can hand off\nsome of that. The most important part\nabout Atlantis is basically locking pull\nrequests posting plan into the\n>> requ. So um yeah so sorry I I'm just\ntrying to track in my brain. We talked\nabout Atlantis and Digger and now we're\ntalking about Sterraph and Terror Grant.\nWell, is there some relationship?\n>> Yes, the relationship is that Digger was\nposting all these thoughts experiment on\non on Reddit. Uh suddenly there's this\nannouncement of state graph. I found it\nquite funny because you know the terror\nteam is actually quite active on Reddit\nand I see them commenting on these posts\nand then I see them announcing state\ngraph and I thought like like it's quite\nsimilar. Uh so so I talked to them and I\nwas like that's interesting like I need\nsomething that I can query. So either\nit's it's the thing that digger is\nbuilding or it's the thing that um the\nterror terror team is building whichever\nright I need to query the state I want\nto know I want to retrieve information\n>> so yeah it's about it's between digger\nand state graph for you okay\n>> right right so hashik happened uh the\nweek last week hashik um is going to be\nby the end of the week at the start of\nthe week they announces we have some big\nannouncement this week we have a really\nbig announcement this week\n>> infograph\n>> infograph is announced Hashikov which is\nvery similar and again to the point of\nAI why do all of these people suddenly\nor all these organizations are suddenly\nso interested in building all of these\nmassive state graphs and dependencies\nbetween states\n>> because AI can easily gro it properly.\n>> Exactly. Because if you want to build an\nNLM agent, every single organization\nright now is positioning themselves like\nwe have the context. We've got all of\nthe information about your\ninfrastructure to for you to query.\n>> Context is king.\n>> Exactly. So, so on one side, Terra team\nannounces state graph, perfect for\nbuilding a context. Digger is like we're\nbuilding the state manager because you\nneed to be able, you know, we we need to\nbe able to query, you know, keep track\nof dependencies, right? Yeah. We all\nwant to keep track of dependencies, use\nour product, right? And and then the big\nannouncement on Wednesday, I think a day\nbefore Hashikov, Digger opens uh this\nvery aggressive video. If you go to\ndigger.dev/opentaco, dev/open taco.\nThat's basically where the project was\nan open taco.\nSo, a couple of things I remember from\nthat video.\nUm, basically they start with like this\nkind of like apocalyptic error messages\nlike people are being held hostages,\nresource under management pricing is\ncriminal. Um, you know, this is not an\nopen standard. Um, and we have the\nsolution. We are building the future of\nuh infrastructure as code. the open\nstandard. You see the first line there\nintroducing project open taco the open\nstandard for terraform open automation\nright and then scroll down there's like\nthis road map the pillars I think the\npillars are are amazing the state\nmanager is the first thing that we just\ntalked about right then they said well\nyou need a private registry for modules\nyou need rolebased access control you\nneed to define your dependencies between\nyour stacks and you need to have uh\ninsights right reality map to code and\nall that\n>> cool I I really like um sites that like\nadvertise their principles or pillars or\nwhatever.\n>> It's I think it's a it's a really nice\nidea. Um\n>> but the the response\n>> w\neven the negative responses can be\ncapitalized on. Right.\n>> Okay. Well, okay. Let's look at what\nhappened next. Right.\n>> What happened next?\nHeat. Heat.\n[Music]\nHeat. Hey, Heat.\nHeat. Heat.\n[Music]\nWhat happened next is they posted this\non Reddit and\nand they posted on on on Hacker News. I\nthink on Hackin News they had three\nuploads. I keep track of all the links\nand on Reddit there was an immediate uh\nyou know very strong backlash from the\ncommunity. Um there's a few Reddit\naccounts that were you know linked to\norganizations I me mentioned before\n>> and they were very critical. They were\nlike why do you talk about an open\nstandard like doesn't the standard\ninvolve communication and like\ncontribution and a community like where\nis the discussion? where is the you know\nthe RF the request for uh comments the\nRFC where is it you know the\nspecification design um and why does it\nis it like declared as the open standard\nbut is does it look like a product like\nthere's a product road map even like how\nis this an open standard how can you\ndeclare to be the standard when you\nhaven't like you know there's no\ncommunity behind it right\n>> and I personally didn't really see that\nbut like apparently that that resonated\nwith a lot of people because that was\npretty much like there weren't that many\ncomments maybe 10 and like four out of\nthem or maybe 50 50% I mean were like\nthis is a product stop you know making\nit look like it's an open standard uh\nit's a product blah blah blah right so\nthey open source the source code uh and\none of the main things that's\ninteresting is they completely integrate\nwith the Terraform cloud uh back end so\nif you're familiar with Terraform as a\nback end you can use S3 you can use um\nPostgress you can use an HTTP remote\nbackend or You can use Terapform cloud.\nSo the Teraphform cloud back end is a\nvery strict protocol that uses like\nauthentication. So you use Terapform\nlogin when you run Terapform plan. You\ncan even have it remote.\n>> So it uses the same back end.\nInteresting.\n>> And they implemented the Terapform cloud\nback end because it's like you know\nTerapform code is open source right\nsource available. So people replicated\nall the API endpoints that Terapform\nuses and they implemented the back end\nof their own version. And that was like\nwhoa cool. They use the whole Terraform\nback end. They have like SSO\nintegration. quite small. So they\n>> and then yeah\n>> the creator of F or open terraform like\ncloud back end comes in and says\n>> okay guys I expect in this day and age\nyou you know people copy code but you\nguys do it without like any attribution\nand you can't even be bothered to to\nchange the comments like you literally\ncopy the file from my project\n>> with the original comments right in it.\n>> What is the project name? F\n>> yeah.\n>> Ouch. Ouch. Indeed.\nYeah. Leg zero uh leg 100f comes into\nthe Reddit comment and says, \"I'm the\ncreator of F. You guys lifted my files.\n>> I didn't even know about I didn't even\nknow about this project. This is\ninteresting.\" Ah,\n>> I bring I bring receipts. I have links\nto all of these Reddit comments. I can\nshare them.\n>> So, there was definitely some hot\ncontroversy.\n>> H Yeah. The funny thing is that most of\nthe like harsh backlash\num I can always link back to the same\naccounts.\nIt's always like two accounts that are\nalways going like you guys say you're no\nstandard but this is a product code. You\nguys are breaking the trust of open\nsource code.\n>> You hinted about it earlier but like on\nReddit um I mean I have one account on\nReddit and I stick to that one account\nbut I know loads of people that have at\nleast two or three accounts on Reddit.\ntwo people going at it from four\naccounts\n>> and the and the moderator because what\nhappened to the post the big\nannouncement of open taco it got deleted\ngot removed I'm very curious now like\nwhy unless like I'm very oblivious\n>> unless I'm really oblivious and and I\nreally don't see that much as a really\nbad like situation I look at this from\nlike docker point of view right docker\ncame in they built contain Linux\ncontainers they built a whole tool\nframework around it and then OCI was\ncreated open container their initiative\nthey created the standard. So for me\nlike if you look at open taco it's a\nproduct and you can like create a\nstandard out of a product like docker\ndid right and being so aggressive and\nsaying you but okay I understand that\nthere is first of the message like the\nYouTube was very aggressive then second\nthe um you know declaring they are the\nopen standard that clearly like upset a\nlot of people right then obviously the\nmassive failure of having this um you\nknow code that happened So what was the\nresponse of um of of Digger to this uh\nbacklash and the post being removed?\n>> A apology, right? So they did an apology\npost\n>> where\n>> um\n>> Oh, let me\n>> Oh,\n>> postmorton open taco using code from\nwithout attribution. This is the chain\nof events.\n>> This is how it happened. We we we did a\nstub five Y's\num and they post it. So I I want to hear\nyour opinion about what you feel about\nthis this this um\n>> so why did the the code was moved from\nas is from an internal\nokay that doesn't really excuse anything\nwhy\n>> and they open source the internal to\nfull to show the full commit history of\nhow that was built when it was built who\nwas doing the PRs and all that\n>> it still doesn't explain yeah\nbecause I'm curious how you would feel\nabout this because the the response was\nalso Interesting.\nWell, I mean,\nI'm Is it Is it called Akams Akum's\nrazor? You know, don't attribute malice\nto what could be excused as, you know,\nincompetence.\nIs that is that the right phrase? um\nrazor is is more about like if if\nsomething if there's a simpler\nexplanation then that's the right\nexplanation but don't attribute malice\nto what could be attributed to like\nstupidity or or incompetence that's uh\nthat's some I don't know exactly what\n>> okay something else but um I I would\nprobably go on the more positive side of\nthings because because uh you know like\nwhen you're in a hurry and they're\nripping code from there I mean it could\nThis is even more the case with AI\nnowadays. Like it wouldn't be surprised\nme if you're writing some code with AI\nand it just steals some code from some\ncode base on GitHub and then and then\nyou're taking flak because like uh you\nhave a comment from another GitHub repo\nand I'll be like, \"Oh shit.\" It sounds\nlike they've fixed this issue, I'm\nguessing. So\nI I mean it's it's a mistake. It's a\nballs up, but I wouldn't uh I would move\non from it. That's my initial feeling.\n>> Right. The response was this is just\nanother product marketing, not really an\napology. Half of your apology talks\nabout the product or something like\nthat. Like I'm trying to find the\nthread. Yes. And you can guess who was\nputting those comments. The same people.\n>> So this is where we are. I mean, how\nlong ago was this? 26th of September.\n>> That was Saturday. Yeah. Okay. That's\nThis is hot hot hot\nsteaming gossip\ntea. I've been like I've been having a\nball this weekend, you know? I was\nliterally eating popcorn like what's\ngoing to happen next?\nWhoa, this happened. Like um I honestly\nlike my personal opinion.\nI mean, I don't really think it's fair\nthe the way that it's being um responded\nto. Maybe I'm biased because I really\nwant something like this to exist. And\num yeah, I know of course\nthe the main like post the main the main\ncomplaint of of the people complaining\nwas like, you know, trust in open source\nhas been eroded constantly. Projects are\nrelicensing. Um you know people are very\nreluctant to to adopt a project now and\nwe need to build trust and trust is\nearned by doing things right and\nstealing code and you know relicensing\nit because is a modilla public license\nand digger and therefore the open taco\ncode as well is actually Apache 2\nlicense so you can't rely it there's no\nattribution so there's like so many nos\nin this in this action like this\ncompletely destroys trust this is\nunacceptable So, so wait a minute.\n>> Uh, Vincent, their repo was open source\ntoo, right?\n>> No. So, they Well, yes, they they moved\nthe they moved the open taco into their\nmain repository. Um, which is a massive\nGolang monor repo. So, if you go to\ndigger. So, the actual\n>> where is the\n>> this is the open taco.\n>> So, this is where they stole the co the\ncode, right? that they\n>> this is the this is the internal one\nthat did they did some quick PC on the\ninternal code and then they copied all\nof that into their main digger\nrepository. So this is the open taco\nthat was private\n>> and then there's if uh there was it\nwasn't into their internal if you go\nback to their profile and you go to\ntheir main monor repo the main one\nthere. So there you have the license\nzone I guess\n>> which is Apache 2.\n>> Oh it's MIT.\n>> Oh it's better even.\nUm,\nokay. Well, thanks for the gossip. I\nthink I got a a taste of uh the what do\nyou call it? The digestion system of\nTerraform or something. You know, what's\ngoing around and what's going to come\nout. And\n>> I I I like some of the like first off, I\nthink the name is the name is very funny\nbecause you know, you have open tofu,\nyou have the concept of tacos and then\nopen taco kind of plays on that open to.\n>> So So who coined tacos then? What's the\n>> tacos is a known way of describing\nTerraform automation and collaboration\nsoftware? Tacos has been around for like\ntwo.\n>> So like if I search for like tacos\nsite hashp.com\ndo they\n>> sure\ndon't think they call it tacos but space\nlift zero and so on. If you search for\nlike terome automation, then you're\ngoing to find a lot of like websites\nthat refer to that as tacos,\n>> right? Taco provider like Spaceelift.\nYeah. So, they do have it on but it's on\nthe discussion. It's on their forum.\nIt's not\n>> interesting. Interesting.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well, anyway, that that was a really\ngood conversation. I think I I need to\num transition into work. Uh, I got stuff\nto\nto uh cards cards to move into different\nlanes and stuff like that.\n>> So, anyway, if anyone is watching this\nto this far, I congratulate you. Okay.\nAll the best, Vincent. Let's catch up.\n>> Some links if you want to add it in some\nlinks.\n>> Yeah, context is king. Context is king.\n>> Yeah, but it's more to discuss. We\ndefinitely have to do another session.\n>> Yeah, we definitely have to do another\nsession. Okay, great. See you, man.\n>> Okay. All right.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:00] The following is a conversation with\n[0:03] Vincent Smith on the latest developments\n[0:07] around Terraform.\n[0:09] Sorry, I I couldn't resist the Lex\n[0:11] Friedman inspired introduction.\n[0:14] Well, I know Vincent from uh Singapore.\n[0:18] He's he's out there somewhere in Asia.\n[0:21] He's a he's a thorough veteran of all\n[0:24] things infrastructure, as am I. I'm\n[0:26] based in the UK\n[0:29] and an infrastructure engineer is my day\n[0:30] job. What is an infrastructure engineer?\n[0:32] I help run those software services that\n[0:36] you use. I sort of help uh provision\n[0:40] those cloud and manage and govern those\n[0:43] cloud services usually AWS.\n[0:46] And uh what one way to provision those\n[0:50] resources is with a popular uh project\n[0:53] called Terraform which fairly recently\n[0:57] uh got bought by IBM and relicicensed uh\n[1:00] under like a commercial license. So the\n[1:03] thing that everyone uses the terraform\n[1:07] is now uh in a sort of a interesting\n[1:11] place and the conversation um that\n[1:14] follows is Vince and I just chatting\n[1:16] about it and hopefully you enjoy it.\n[1:19] Please comment below and um I will uh\n[1:24] try my best to answer all your\n[1:25] questions. Thank you.\n[1:27] >> So what's the tea?\n[1:29] >> What's the tea? So you had some you had\n[1:31] some juicy infrastructure gossip.\n[1:34] >> Okay. So maybe some background like\n[1:38] there's quite a few companies built\n[1:40] around Terraform.\n[1:42] Some of them being Space Lift, M0, you\n[1:44] know, you know the whole deal with the\n[1:46] the licensing change around Terraform\n[1:48] and um a lot of companies forking the\n[1:51] last uh Mozilla public licensed version\n[1:54] of Terraform and then maintaining it as\n[1:56] a fork under open tofu. Right.\n[1:58] >> Right. And um aside from those\n[2:01] companies, there's also Digger. I'm not\n[2:04] sure how much Digger.dev is involved in\n[2:07] this open TOFU effort. I'm not sure\n[2:09] actually who are the founding companies\n[2:11] behind Open Tofu. Um the the the term\n[2:14] Taco Terapform automation TA\n[2:18] collaboration CO and software. So Tacos,\n[2:21] right? T A C O S Terafform automation\n[2:24] collaboration software.\n[2:25] >> Okay. Okay.\n[2:26] >> Okay. So a lot of this Terapform\n[2:28] automation and collaboration software\n[2:30] examples are Teraphform Cloud where you\n[2:31] push code into Git and then it triggers\n[2:35] a a run of Terapform plan and apply. Um\n[2:38] and and so Atlantis is a famous uh open\n[2:41] source tacos.\n[2:42] >> Yeah, I I just have Digger open right\n[2:43] now and it looks like it just reminds me\n[2:46] of Atlantis.\n[2:48] >> Yeah, so Digger is an alternative to\n[2:49] Atlantis with the premise being why do I\n[2:52] need a separate EC2 instance when I hub\n[2:54] a whole bunch of CI/CD runners. So what\n[2:56] they do is they give you CI/CD workflows\n[3:00] for um GitLab and GitHub actions and\n[3:03] then they simply have an orchestration\n[3:05] API that those runner workflows can you\n[3:09] know be orchestrated with. So whenever\n[3:12] um a an event comes into the GitHub, it\n[3:15] maybe triggers through the orchestration\n[3:18] layer and the orchestration layer would\n[3:19] then dispatch uh dispatch uh GitHub\n[3:21] workflow. So it actually uses your\n[3:23] GitHub runners that you may have\n[3:25] self-hosted or that you are having part\n[3:27] of your GitHub hosting to to run the\n[3:29] terraform jobs, right? You don't have a\n[3:32] separate terapform instance. So\n[3:34] >> so their view on how is is the minimal\n[3:39] like impact like the easiest fit into\n[3:42] existing uh company um workflows. So\n[3:46] they build digger in that uh frame and\n[3:49] then they mentioned like you know what's\n[3:51] really missing and a big problem with\n[3:52] Atlantis as well is the ability to just\n[3:56] manage the orchestration. So Hashi Hashi\n[3:59] conference happened last week where\n[4:01] Hashikov is going to make a lot of\n[4:02] announcements. So there was actually\n[4:04] quite a lot of um things or news\n[4:07] happening around Hashik um from other\n[4:09] companies trying to you know use the\n[4:13] event to also\n[4:14] >> Wow, that must be such a cool event.\n[4:15] Atlanta. Okay, cool.\n[4:17] >> Okay.\n[4:18] >> Yeah.\n[4:18] >> Yep.\n[4:19] >> So So last year on Hashicon they\n[4:21] announced\n[4:23] uh stack beta. I think the two years ago\n[4:26] they announced uh terraform stacks\n[4:29] private beta and then public beta and\n[4:31] now it's finally ga general available.\n[4:34] So what is terraform stacks? Steraphhone\n[4:35] stacks is basically the the ability to\n[4:37] define multiple terraform states in one\n[4:40] stack. So that they for example a common\n[4:43] scenario is you have a network and then\n[4:46] you have a Kubernetes cluster and then\n[4:47] you have some Argo CD deployment that\n[4:50] needs to depend on that Kubernetes\n[4:51] cluster right so you can\n[4:55] those are all all individual components\n[4:57] right the network has to exist and\n[4:59] create all the subnets private and\n[5:00] public subnets for the application nodes\n[5:02] to be provisioned in. So the Kubernetes\n[5:03] cluster can only be created after the\n[5:05] network has been created. So Terapform\n[5:06] STS will help you to orchestrate across\n[5:08] multiple terapform states.\n[5:10] >> So this is something that is cloud only,\n[5:13] right? They will this is not part of the\n[5:15] Terapform CLI until the most recent\n[5:17] release where you can actually use the\n[5:19] Terraform CLI to query the cloud stacks.\n[5:22] But cloud stacks is cloud only except\n[5:24] for some CLI to get some information\n[5:26] about your stacks. But but wait a\n[5:27] minute, Terraform must have had this\n[5:28] feature before to depend on another\n[5:30] stack for another I mean you could you\n[5:33] can fish out values from another\n[5:34] >> Yes, you can fish out values and I\n[5:36] believe they just use workspaces and\n[5:38] outputs between workspaces but they\n[5:40] didn't have a crossworkspace\n[5:41] orchestration uh um feature as far as\n[5:44] I'm aware.\n[5:44] >> What what does orchestration mean like\n[5:46] like a like a like a\n[5:48] >> this coordination\n[5:49] >> like depends on on things like this?\n[5:52] >> Yes. like I want to provision a new\n[5:54] environment and that environment\n[5:55] consists of a network, a cluster and a\n[5:57] githops controller and the uh network\n[6:00] needs to be created first then the\n[6:02] cluster then the controller. Okay.\n[6:03] >> So yeah\n[6:04] >> so when you say orchestration I'm just\n[6:06] like mapping it into GitHub workflows.\n[6:08] Yeah. But okay carry on. when yeah when\n[6:11] I say orchestration I mean like\n[6:12] coordination between different um you\n[6:15] know activities that need to be ran and\n[6:17] and you know orchestrated you know the\n[6:19] events between them that trigger the\n[6:21] activities or actions to be\n[6:23] >> executable something\n[6:26] maybe more like a make file in my you\n[6:28] know Dumbo brain you know\n[6:30] >> a make file gives you a couple of that's\n[6:33] more like a task runner right a make\n[6:35] file gives you a couple of targets to\n[6:36] execute and then you you are the\n[6:39] orchestrator usually that says first I\n[6:40] need to run this make file has like some\n[6:43] minimum orchestration\n[6:44] >> well it has like files so you you you\n[6:47] say like you know I need this file food\n[6:48] to be built before this file bar so so\n[6:52] it it will run the target for fu but to\n[6:54] be honest make files are never quite\n[6:56] used that way but uh anyway we're\n[6:58] getting distracted here so orchestration\n[7:00] I'm I'm I'm all aboard on GA\n[7:04] >> all right so there's been GA now great\n[7:06] um however\n[7:09] A lot of these Terraform automation and\n[7:12] collaborations software or tacos have\n[7:15] switched to a resource under management\n[7:17] pricing mechanism where you're being\n[7:20] charged for every resource that um they\n[7:23] manage for you and so if you have a lot\n[7:25] of Terraform resources then you are\n[7:27] getting a very big bill over time right\n[7:30] >> yeah yeah I mean that's that's really\n[7:32] evident in my current client with data\n[7:35] dog I mean when when you look at each\n[7:37] resource cost. It's cheap,\n[7:39] >> but when you have a zillion resources\n[7:41] and the sprawling cloud of which you\n[7:43] inevitably do, it's really expensive,\n[7:46] >> right? So, one of the arguments\n[7:51] of um you know the advantage of of using\n[7:54] a a collaboration software like you can\n[7:56] use Atlantis, you can run it selfhosted\n[7:59] um but it doesn't really do cross tech\n[8:00] orchestration all this tech feature\n[8:02] doesn't exist. Um, so I've also\n[8:05] personally been thinking like how do I\n[8:07] add on orchestration on top of Atlantis\n[8:09] for example because Atlantis whenever\n[8:11] you open a pull request it will um\n[8:14] identify any GitHub um it will use git\n[8:18] to identify any changes like based on\n[8:20] the pull request compare compared to the\n[8:22] base. It will identify which terraform\n[8:24] projects may have changed. It can auto\n[8:26] detect that or you can be very explicit\n[8:28] on how it needs to track which projects\n[8:29] need to be run and where those projects\n[8:31] live. Um and then Terraform will\n[8:34] basically try to run all of those\n[8:36] projects. If you want, you can auto\n[8:37] plan. So every time a pull request is\n[8:39] opened, it will auto plan any projects\n[8:41] it believes that may have changed and it\n[8:44] runs them all at the same time. So\n[8:46] obviously if you make a pull request\n[8:47] that creates three different components\n[8:50] and they depend on each other, then one\n[8:52] of them will plan successfully, the rest\n[8:53] of them will fail because the other\n[8:54] components don't exist, right? So you\n[8:57] have the ability to do some type of\n[8:59] orchestration if you manually um define\n[9:03] or uh execution groups. So Atlantis has\n[9:05] the ability to say execution group one\n[9:07] and then execution group two then\n[9:09] execution group three. A little bit like\n[9:10] Argo CD uh deployment waves. Uh it's the\n[9:13] same same.\n[9:14] >> Okay. Yeah.\n[9:16] >> Uh it's execution order group.\n[9:18] >> Okay. Wow.\n[9:20] >> Yeah. So it's for ordering. And then uh\n[9:23] about two years ago another PR came in\n[9:24] which was the ability to define\n[9:26] dependency. So you uh which basically\n[9:28] you can use order group to determine\n[9:31] when to run the which projects only\n[9:34] after a certain other projects have been\n[9:36] run. And then the dependency was that uh\n[9:38] Atlantis would fail or bail if uh one of\n[9:41] the projects dependencies hasn't been\n[9:43] applied yet. So it has a very basic\n[9:45] tracking of of of a project. It says\n[9:47] like okay this one is planned this one\n[9:49] is uh\n[9:50] >> applied\n[9:51] >> um and and if it tries to if you try to\n[9:54] run a plan and it and the dependencies\n[9:56] have not been resolved it will fail\n[9:57] because it has these dependencies of\n[9:59] other projects that must be um you know\n[10:01] resolved first. Yeah. But in in reality\n[10:04] those two concepts don't really map\n[10:05] directly to like the ability to\n[10:07] orchestrate like to say uh run this and\n[10:09] then run that right. Um because that\n[10:12] should be sufficient to just say\n[10:13] dependency. You don't need execution\n[10:14] group and dependency. treat it\n[10:16] separately. One is to make sure the\n[10:18] dependency has been resolved. One is to\n[10:20] make sure that one\n[10:21] >> I mean ordering is like very basic uh\n[10:24] you know you're you're on a maturity\n[10:26] journey that that's when I see people\n[10:28] doing that that's like very basic. It's\n[10:30] like kind of manual but when you have a\n[10:32] a proper tool like any like make or\n[10:36] depend or or an orchestrator as you say\n[10:38] then it becomes\n[10:39] >> spacelift or m0 they all have the\n[10:40] ability to do that even teragrant like\n[10:42] even teragrant within the repository you\n[10:45] can define dependencies between your\n[10:47] terafr grunt um you know states and then\n[10:50] you uh teragrant can do a run all uh to\n[10:54] orchestrate it so basically run\n[10:55] everything in in in order so it\n[10:57] >> it basically builds a graph\n[11:00] uh across your different Terraform\n[11:01] states. So, so within a diff within a\n[11:03] Terraform state, Terraform builds a\n[11:05] graph between the resources, right? this\n[11:07] resource need to be created and then it\n[11:08] that resource depends on it and then and\n[11:10] it does its own parallelization and like\n[11:12] execution and and sometimes you need to\n[11:15] be you need to terraform you need to\n[11:16] tell terraform hey actually you know\n[11:18] there's like for example an API gateway\n[11:21] when you create the API gateway and all\n[11:22] of its integrations in AWS um if you\n[11:25] then try to trigger an API uh gateway\n[11:27] deployment if that if that uh actual\n[11:31] integration hasn't been resolved or\n[11:32] doesn't or the lambda hasn't been\n[11:34] attached and you trigger the deployment\n[11:35] it will fail AWS API I will say got it\n[11:37] >> this gateway doesn't have a an\n[11:39] integration so it will fail and and in\n[11:41] that case there's no direct dependency\n[11:43] because the deployment has a dependency\n[11:45] implicit dependency on the gateway\n[11:47] because you use the gateway ID uh the\n[11:50] API gateway identity so when you you use\n[11:53] that link terapform knows I need to\n[11:54] create a gateway then I need to create\n[11:55] the deployment but it does not have an\n[11:58] explicit dependency between the\n[11:59] deployment and for example an\n[12:01] integration on the gateway so when when\n[12:03] you don't do that then um you get a race\n[12:06] condition. So it may manifest um\n[12:08] sometimes it may not manifest right u\n[12:11] but but the right way is to really say\n[12:13] like okay this deployment also depends\n[12:15] on these other resources you know and\n[12:17] you have to explicitly say it depends on\n[12:19] this gateway integration with this\n[12:21] lambda and so on right\n[12:22] >> yeah got it\n[12:23] >> so that that becomes very um that works\n[12:25] really well with terraform within a\n[12:27] terraform state\n[12:28] >> so terapform is amazing um in handling\n[12:31] these resource dependencies sometimes\n[12:33] you have to give it a little bit of a\n[12:34] hint uh now from a higher level outside\n[12:36] of the state. Um, creating dependencies\n[12:39] between states adds a lot of like\n[12:42] additional orchestration overhead that\n[12:44] makes it difficult sometimes. Like one\n[12:46] of the most common problem is I'm going\n[12:48] to change my network for example and I'm\n[12:49] going to change my output and now my\n[12:52] subnets are no longer a map of key value\n[12:54] pairs. Maybe they become an ordered list\n[12:57] and then maybe I have another component\n[12:59] which reads a key and then gets an error\n[13:02] because there's no longer a map there.\n[13:04] it's\n[13:05] right I understand the complexity\n[13:08] >> that happens um so why do people\n[13:10] separate everything right why why do\n[13:12] they create one state for the network\n[13:14] one state for the cluster and that's\n[13:16] often because of like life cycle um or\n[13:19] ownership\n[13:20] >> right\n[13:21] >> yeah so a network usually has a much\n[13:23] longer life cycle than the clusters\n[13:25] within or even the deployments on on\n[13:28] clusters\n[13:28] >> I mean I usually say blast radius to to\n[13:30] to clients like that's why we have so\n[13:33] many goddamn stacks.\n[13:35] >> Yes. Uh blast radius and um with that is\n[13:39] also for example if you use and again\n[13:42] this comes back to like a lot of\n[13:43] discussions within the terraform space\n[13:45] which is like do I always uh only apply\n[13:48] after I merge. So um you know only apply\n[13:51] off the master branch or do I like do I\n[13:54] allow people to run apply from a from a\n[13:56] branch and basically the branch is\n[13:58] modifying the states which is shared\n[13:59] between the master branch and then if\n[14:01] somebody runs an apply then they may\n[14:03] like inadvertently undo my changes\n[14:05] because my merged yet right\n[14:07] >> I see that all the time in my current\n[14:09] client we have a channel called\n[14:11] Terraform stack wars or something like\n[14:13] that people basically announce that I'm\n[14:16] going to make a change to the monitoring\n[14:18] stack or the networking stack.\n[14:19] and then they create a branch and imply\n[14:22] it in dev and uh of course people need\n[14:25] to somehow lock it so that they don't\n[14:28] stamp on each other\n[14:30] >> right so Atlantis has a very good\n[14:32] feature there and a lot of organizations\n[14:35] follow Atlantis way of doing things\n[14:37] which is as soon as you open a pull\n[14:38] request and Atlantis runs a plan it\n[14:41] basically keeps a lock on that\n[14:42] particular state\n[14:44] >> so if another pull request goes against\n[14:46] that particular state like Atlantis\n[14:47] detects a project and and tries to plan\n[14:49] it, it will get an error saying, \"Oh,\n[14:51] this pull request number 34 owned by\n[14:53] Vincent owns the lock on this particular\n[14:55] project.\n[14:57] The lock is quite needs to be quite long\n[14:58] lived because like\n[15:00] >> as long as the PR holds the lock so it's\n[15:02] in a database like like an object\n[15:04] database keeping track of the lock and\n[15:07] um and so basically until somebody goes\n[15:10] in and clears the lock from that PR that\n[15:12] PR holds the lock.\n[15:14] >> Nice.\n[15:14] >> Right. And that's because Atlantis tries\n[15:16] to be deterministic. So when you when it\n[15:18] auto plans it will write a plan on disk\n[15:20] and when somebody approves it he will\n[15:22] approve exactly that plan that run right\n[15:25] and if something changes um for whatever\n[15:28] reason if you if you try to trigger an\n[15:30] apply and you know Terraform tries to\n[15:33] and this is a terapform feature right\n[15:34] Atlantis passes the previously generated\n[15:37] and approved plan from disk into the\n[15:38] Terraform apply and then the Terapform\n[15:41] will immediately reject it if it\n[15:42] discovers that something changed and the\n[15:44] plan is no longer valid. So the plan has\n[15:46] become stale. So then you need to like\n[15:47] rerun plan to get an approval. It can be\n[15:51] >> depending depending you can be flex. You\n[15:53] can say as soon as it you know the PR\n[15:55] has received one one approval it's okay.\n[15:58] You can use the GitHub approval\n[15:59] requirements um you know whenever a\n[16:02] commit is pushed maybe it invalidates\n[16:03] the PR. So you use the you know your uh\n[16:06] version control um gates on your pull\n[16:08] request.\n[16:09] >> Yeah.\n[16:11] It sounds like Atlantis has been\n[16:12] evolving over the years that I I mean I\n[16:14] haven't used it. Uh so that sounds good.\n[16:17] I mean does it have does Atlantis for\n[16:19] example have a feature where if you\n[16:21] don't destroy anything like you know if\n[16:24] then just approves\n[16:29] >> that like some sort of policy is\n[16:31] >> auto approval.\n[16:32] >> Um\n[16:34] that's not actually no not that I'm\n[16:36] aware of. It's probably possible but it\n[16:38] would I mean technically everything is\n[16:39] possible right but it would require a\n[16:41] little bit of additional I don't have\n[16:43] any um such setup currently\n[16:45] >> but this is definitely like another\n[16:47] requirement that um people ask it's like\n[16:50] whenever like I want an auto approve or\n[16:52] an auto deploy flow so I want Atlantis\n[16:56] approval to automatically happen and\n[16:58] >> yeah I mean I mean and there's probably\n[17:00] there's probably AI in the mix here you\n[17:02] know like\n[17:04] >> you don't know I would avoid AI in those\n[17:06] situations to be honest.\n[17:07] >> Well, I've I've been using Copilot in\n[17:10] GitHub Copilot um as a reviewer in in\n[17:13] PRs in in the team and I'm actually\n[17:15] quite surprised how good it is in some\n[17:17] ways. It's it's better than any like I\n[17:21] mean is it better it complements any\n[17:23] like linting tool and things like this,\n[17:25] doesn't it?\n[17:26] >> We can go deeper on like all of the\n[17:28] things that we can do with context\n[17:29] because this really relates to the tea\n[17:31] that I want to talk about.\n[17:32] >> Okay. Okay.\n[17:33] >> Okay.\n[17:33] >> Oh my god. 20 minutes in. Yeah. So, so\n[17:37] you you'll have to edit this heavily,\n[17:39] but we've basically explained some of\n[17:41] the, you know, options because what you\n[17:43] just mentioned is we have some manual\n[17:44] coordination to lock PRs. Atlantis does\n[17:47] that for you. Um, but this means that\n[17:49] Atlantis locks the PR and then it has a\n[17:54] apply before merge philosophy and a lot\n[17:56] of organizations are like this is\n[17:58] unacceptable. uh you know trunk is the\n[18:00] source of truth and um we cannot have\n[18:03] anything applied until it landed on\n[18:04] trunk that's where it should be\n[18:06] >> merge uh okay\n[18:08] >> yeah because Atlantis keeps the lock on\n[18:09] the PR as soon as everything is applied\n[18:12] within the PR then that needs to be\n[18:14] merged as soon as possible needs to go\n[18:15] into trunk right because now the state\n[18:18] file reflects whatever is on that branch\n[18:20] yeah and if that is not merged and\n[18:22] somebody you know runs Terafform from\n[18:24] trunk from their laptop without you know\n[18:26] having this at\n[18:28] >> I Atlant's lock is purely on the\n[18:30] Atlantic side. It doesn't\n[18:31] >> contentious but it doesn't it doesn't\n[18:33] seem like such a big deal to me really\n[18:36] because you're working.\n[18:38] >> Yeah. So some organizations are very\n[18:39] strict and so some uh some workflows\n[18:43] they they say apply before merge is\n[18:45] incorrect. It should be merge and then\n[18:48] apply. So my main I am from the Atlantis\n[18:52] like I grew up with Atlantis. that glad\n[18:54] this solved a lot of my problems and and\n[18:57] for me I have experienced many times\n[18:59] that the plan looks perfect but when you\n[19:01] try to apply it fails right for whatever\n[19:04] reason because you know a terapform plan\n[19:07] doesn't really validate like\n[19:09] >> yeah yeah yeah\n[19:10] >> I guess I guess terraform crud reads\n[19:13] only the attributes and then does this\n[19:16] internal validation of like this needs\n[19:17] to change and then um the actual ter AWS\n[19:20] provider may get an invalid response I\n[19:24] mean to be honest I I prefer a workflow\n[19:26] where we don't even plan because because\n[19:30] >> plan doesn't catch probably I'm making a\n[19:32] crazy figure about AI it plan doesn't\n[19:36] catch like 80% of the the issues that\n[19:38] you might get when you when you're\n[19:40] deploying infrastructure. I mean it it\n[19:42] it doesn't really help you move fast. Um\n[19:46] >> okay right so so so there's just I\n[19:48] wanted to highlight that Atlantis is one\n[19:50] solution. It lacks a lot of the\n[19:51] orchestrations, gives you a lot of other\n[19:53] stuff. Um,\n[19:54] >> and it's open source and it's it's it's\n[19:56] easy. You don't have to worry about\n[19:58] >> can run it on $15 EC2 instance. You can\n[20:00] go to the digger docs where they go into\n[20:02] like pretty good arguments against it\n[20:04] saying like, well, you know, it's never\n[20:06] just one Atlantis instance. They have\n[20:08] like a a doc where they compare the\n[20:10] problems with Atlantis. I believe they\n[20:12] say uh Atlantis is never Yeah. compared\n[20:15] to Atlantis. I like their arguments.\n[20:16] It's like it's never just one instance.\n[20:20] Where is\n[20:22] I can't see it now. But there was or\n[20:25] maybe I I remember it from another um\n[20:28] tacos. Uh\n[20:29] >> but but since but since Atlas is just\n[20:32] doesn't is is not like cloud pricing. I\n[20:36] mean that's a huge win in my book. They\n[20:39] don't even mention the price. I I talk\n[20:41] to to friends of mine that are running,\n[20:43] you know, 10 thousands of Terraform\n[20:45] resources of, you know, very big scale\n[20:48] and when they look at any RUM quotes,\n[20:51] it's just like blows up their cloud bill\n[20:54] because it's it goes from I'm I'm paying\n[20:56] $20 a month from a, you know, a decent\n[20:58] EC2 instance running Atlantis or\n[21:00] running, you know, on a Kubernetes\n[21:02] container. So, it's even less um, you\n[21:04] know, CPU memory usage and I can, you\n[21:07] know, so I'm not paying anything right\n[21:08] now. I'm paying like 20 bucks max and\n[21:10] I'm going to be facing $10,000 a month\n[21:12] if I switch to like the cloud just\n[21:15] because I want that like additional\n[21:16] policy as code or I want additional\n[21:18] orchestration features or arbback like\n[21:21] that's not in Atlantis right you don't\n[21:23] have proper arback you can do like some\n[21:24] code owner setup with your GitHub PRs to\n[21:27] you know only validate that if that\n[21:29] person approves then it can be applied\n[21:31] we do some conf test in my organization\n[21:33] where we we do invalidate like or we\n[21:36] block a PR if there's any changes to an\n[21:38] IM policy so that the security has to\n[21:40] come in and review these changes to IM\n[21:42] policies for example. So we have some\n[21:43] conf test like that\n[21:44] >> some some routings going on.\n[21:46] >> Yes and conf test is also um like\n[21:50] hardcoded into Atlantis right you can\n[21:52] Atlantis has their own workflows and the\n[21:54] default workflows includes confest so it\n[21:56] runs an OPA um policy against your um\n[21:59] Terapform plan but if you don't want to\n[22:02] use confest you can use other OPA or um\n[22:05] other scanners. I I don't think I've\n[22:07] even used comp like like why is it\n[22:10] claiming to be\n[22:11] >> secure by design and\n[22:15] >> uh maybe because when you run Atlantis\n[22:17] you're running an EC2 instance that may\n[22:19] that has a lot of permissions like an IM\n[22:21] policy that has administrative like uh\n[22:22] permissions and maybe that's like you\n[22:25] you are responsible for securing your\n[22:27] Atlantis because your Atlantis in the\n[22:29] end is the one that takes or assumes the\n[22:32] profile to make all the cloud changes\n[22:34] and then that instance It's quite normal\n[22:36] though. That's pretty normal.\n[22:39] >> Yeah, it's\n[22:41] >> and so I mean it's\n[22:42] >> because you're hosting an EC2 instance,\n[22:44] you need to like you can't make it\n[22:46] publicly accessible, but it needs to\n[22:48] receive GitHub web hook. So it must have\n[22:50] some ingress path for\n[22:51] >> conversely, I'm I'm assuming that if\n[22:53] you're using digger, you have to hand\n[22:55] over the crown jewels to digger just\n[22:56] like CICD to to the ter.\n[22:59] >> No, they don't. So, so they are purely\n[23:01] like the orchestration layer that just\n[23:03] dispatches the the workers and your\n[23:05] workers are your CI/CD system. So, you\n[23:07] can you can have those hooked up to your\n[23:09] GitHub like you have runners for for for\n[23:11] stuff anyway, right? So, so basically\n[23:13] they hand off like\n[23:15] >> I don't Okay. Okay. Let's let's get to\n[23:18] the the gossip then.\n[23:19] >> Okay. So, so aside from Atlantis,\n[23:22] there's Digger, there's Spaceelift,\n[23:23] there's M0, there's Terot Team, there's\n[23:24] quite a few. And so Digger has been\n[23:27] posting these um thought experiments on\n[23:29] Reddit where they talk about the states\n[23:31] manager. What if a terraform\n[23:34] orchestration like Tacos wasn't a\n[23:36] runner? Like most of these like\n[23:38] Spacelift, M0, they're all providing\n[23:40] runners um basically triggered by web\n[23:42] hooks. But what if you decouple the\n[23:45] runner infrastructure and just focus on\n[23:47] the state management part? So the\n[23:49] biggest problem that we have because we\n[23:50] are splitting states. Um the biggest\n[23:54] problem is how do we like manage the\n[23:58] dependencies between states and and\n[24:00] identify you know if if one state\n[24:02] changes what else is impacted because\n[24:05] for example I make a change to my\n[24:06] network now I need to invalidate\n[24:08] everything that depends on my network so\n[24:10] it may need\n[24:10] >> so so we we're go we're going back to\n[24:12] Terraform stacks aren't we here if\n[24:14] you're talking about states\n[24:15] >> it's kind of related to the stacks\n[24:16] stacks capture the dependencies between\n[24:20] states but the argument from digger on\n[24:24] Reddit like the thought experiments were\n[24:26] about like let's imagine an API that you\n[24:31] only use it to define dependencies\n[24:32] between your states and it gives you\n[24:36] endpoints to you know identify any stale\n[24:40] states. So a state that needs to be\n[24:42] replanned because something it depends\n[24:44] on has changed. So basically track the\n[24:47] edges, color the edges when outputs\n[24:49] change and then replan or like give an\n[24:52] basically give back a list of jobs to\n[24:54] run because there's these states need to\n[24:56] run, right?\n[24:56] >> Color color the edges. That's an\n[24:58] interesting expression. Yeah.\n[25:00] >> Color the Yeah. Um it literally what it\n[25:02] does it's a a state multigraph because\n[25:04] it keeps track of multiple edges between\n[25:06] states for each\n[25:07] >> out. Where are these discussions\n[25:08] happening on terraform or something? on\n[25:11] the terraform subreddit which was like I\n[25:14] think posted around maybe June.\n[25:17] >> Okay.\n[25:18] >> So state management calendar edges I\n[25:20] think I'm I'm with you.\n[25:22] >> Right. So so I was very interested and I\n[25:24] talked with um with with the the team\n[25:26] because I'm building something that\n[25:28] really needs this state orchestration\n[25:30] and not only the state orchestration but\n[25:32] I need to hook into it because I\n[25:33] generate terapform. So I want to be able\n[25:36] to read the outputs and I want to be\n[25:38] able to see what's the shape of an\n[25:39] output. So I want something that can\n[25:42] give me um or can help me track\n[25:44] dependencies or outputs and then\n[25:46] identify what is the source of that\n[25:48] output and things like that. So I talked\n[25:50] to them like hey um I want to know what\n[25:52] you guys like I'm interested to help\n[25:53] build with this. So I had a call with\n[25:54] them and they presented to me uh\n[25:56] something that was they were building in\n[25:58] stealth at the time and they were just\n[26:00] wanted to get some feedback and it was\n[26:02] called open taco. Okay interesting. So\n[26:05] that was about like two weeks ago. Then\n[26:08] not much after Terra team the other\n[26:10] tacos provider announced uh an\n[26:13] interesting project called state\n[26:15] graph.dev state graph.dev.\n[26:20] Yes. So terraform without the state file\n[26:22] bottleneck. Like they their argument is\n[26:24] basically the the reason we are\n[26:26] splitting states is because we don't\n[26:28] have proper tools to manage our\n[26:30] terapform state because the terraform\n[26:32] tool is only able to manage a single\n[26:35] state. The real problem is if we were to\n[26:38] create like a massive teralith basically\n[26:42] one big state where all of your\n[26:43] environments are and then we improve the\n[26:46] actual tooling around this single\n[26:49] massive state and we're able to like\n[26:51] terraform apply uh slices of it and\n[26:53] we're able to you know control arbback\n[26:56] of individual resources like we're able\n[26:58] to track ownership and and approvals\n[27:00] against the individual resources. we're\n[27:02] able to solve a lot of the problems why\n[27:04] we are having this blast radius and and\n[27:06] these arguments.\n[27:07] >> Yeah.\n[27:08] >> I've been argument is\n[27:10] >> yeah that I've been thinking this we\n[27:13] need like a monolithic\n[27:15] kind of state\n[27:19] that problem.\n[27:20] >> Yeah.\n[27:20] >> Yeah. So they announced like let's get\n[27:22] rid of this state you know multi-state\n[27:24] problem. Um and at the same time you\n[27:28] have uh Tara Grant or Grunt Works\n[27:30] promoting these uh kill the terit\n[27:33] advertisement or workshops. It's very\n[27:35] funny. My LinkedIn feed is like on one\n[27:37] side Grunt Works you know advertising of\n[27:40] kill the monolith uh kill the ter\n[27:44] >> break\n[27:44] >> breaking the ter\n[27:47] workshops and they're like um you know\n[27:49] terits are killing you. You must have\n[27:52] responded like\n[27:53] >> a monolithic terapform state.\n[27:56] >> Well,\n[27:58] no one ever does that but uh I don't see\n[28:00] the problem there.\n[28:03] companies like Grunt works they're like\n[28:04] consultancy and they're going into a lot\n[28:06] of places where people you know like in\n[28:08] in-house develop their own terapform\n[28:11] setup and then they face all kind of\n[28:13] issues and basically teragrant is quite\n[28:15] extreme because when you use teragrant\n[28:18] you pretty much get one state per module\n[28:20] so you build one module and then you\n[28:22] invoke that module and that's one state\n[28:24] you cannot like have multiple modules\n[28:26] this is a bit crazy right I mean if you\n[28:28] imagine how small modules sometimes are\n[28:30] I can tell you in a previous place I\n[28:31] worked at we like three years of terror\n[28:33] grants and we had like 300 or 400\n[28:35] terraform states. It was insane.\n[28:36] >> So, so, so I don't understand. So, if\n[28:39] they do it in such a fragmented way,\n[28:42] then how can they claim that that the\n[28:45] monolithic terraform state is a problem?\n[28:48] >> No, they're coming into organizations\n[28:50] and they're saying, uh, we will help you\n[28:52] break down your terror because all of\n[28:53] your problems are because of the terith.\n[28:57] >> That's crazy to me, but okay.\n[28:59] >> Right. And they have they also launched\n[29:00] a cloud product called Terra Terracale\n[29:03] or Teragrant scale. So they they\n[29:06] launched a product uh basically to\n[29:08] migrate you into and then orchestrate.\n[29:11] >> Oh okay. So it's like a importing blah\n[29:14] blah blah\n[29:15] >> right. Okay. So so that was just an\n[29:17] anecdote because I'm seeing on one site\n[29:19] um Terra team constantly posting about\n[29:22] don't break down your ter is not your\n[29:24] problem. The problem is the tooling. And\n[29:26] on the other side I have like grunt work\n[29:27] sponsor saying we have workshops to help\n[29:29] you break down the term.\n[29:32] Yeah, I'm definitely in camp um state\n[29:35] graph. Definitely.\n[29:37] >> Right. Yeah. So, so they hit hacker news\n[29:39] uh front page the moment they posted\n[29:41] this and um they Yeah.\n[29:44] >> Nine point. Oh, yeah.\n[29:45] >> That one. Yeah. Like 13 days ago.\n[29:47] >> That's quite respectable,\n[29:49] >> right? And then they also got like the\n[29:52] mailing like they they said they have\n[29:54] hundreds of organizations interested.\n[29:56] They're looking for design partners to\n[29:58] to help build out what people want from\n[30:01] a state graph and what it looks like.\n[30:03] They're even hiring Okamel developers,\n[30:06] but they won't train you. I try I asked\n[30:09] they said no, we don't have time to\n[30:11] train you. Um, so you must know Okamel\n[30:13] and then um they're building this their\n[30:15] launch date, their road map is for\n[30:17] quarter 16.\n[30:19] >> Atlantis is written in what? Python, I\n[30:21] guess, or something.\n[30:21] >> Golang, a massive Golang source code.\n[30:25] Oh, nice.\n[30:27] >> Quite complicated. I don't know about\n[30:28] Golen for monolithic like\n[30:31] >> it gets really complicated.\n[30:32] >> It's not that comp. I love go.\n[30:34] >> The problem with with Atlantis is that\n[30:37] it's so ingrained into the pull request\n[30:39] flow that everything is like based off\n[30:42] the idea that it's coming from a pull\n[30:44] request event which is horrible. Like\n[30:46] for example, they try to add an API\n[30:48] endpoint to run Terraform plans and it's\n[30:51] really painful because it like oh you\n[30:53] have a pull request, right? Where else\n[30:55] are we going to run a plan on? Right.\n[30:57] >> Yeah.\n[30:58] >> So it's so\n[30:59] >> okay. So but anyway, Atlantis is not\n[31:04] um sorry my my head space is in this\n[31:07] whole monolithic versus\n[31:09] >> Atlantis doesn't really dictate how you\n[31:11] organize your state. Yeah, you know has\n[31:14] this auto discovery to to find your hash\n[31:16] your terapform configuration files. You\n[31:18] even have like integration with terror\n[31:20] so that you can automatically like you\n[31:21] can let terror actually run the\n[31:23] terraform across your like repository\n[31:26] and then you can Atlantis can hand off\n[31:28] some of that. The most important part\n[31:29] about Atlantis is basically locking pull\n[31:32] requests posting plan into the\n[31:34] >> requ. So um yeah so sorry I I'm just\n[31:39] trying to track in my brain. We talked\n[31:41] about Atlantis and Digger and now we're\n[31:42] talking about Sterraph and Terror Grant.\n[31:45] Well, is there some relationship?\n[31:46] >> Yes, the relationship is that Digger was\n[31:48] posting all these thoughts experiment on\n[31:50] on on Reddit. Uh suddenly there's this\n[31:53] announcement of state graph. I found it\n[31:55] quite funny because you know the terror\n[31:57] team is actually quite active on Reddit\n[31:58] and I see them commenting on these posts\n[32:01] and then I see them announcing state\n[32:03] graph and I thought like like it's quite\n[32:06] similar. Uh so so I talked to them and I\n[32:08] was like that's interesting like I need\n[32:11] something that I can query. So either\n[32:12] it's it's the thing that digger is\n[32:14] building or it's the thing that um the\n[32:16] terror terror team is building whichever\n[32:18] right I need to query the state I want\n[32:20] to know I want to retrieve information\n[32:22] >> so yeah it's about it's between digger\n[32:24] and state graph for you okay\n[32:26] >> right right so hashik happened uh the\n[32:29] week last week hashik um is going to be\n[32:32] by the end of the week at the start of\n[32:34] the week they announces we have some big\n[32:36] announcement this week we have a really\n[32:37] big announcement this week\n[32:38] >> infograph\n[32:40] >> infograph is announced Hashikov which is\n[32:43] very similar and again to the point of\n[32:45] AI why do all of these people suddenly\n[32:47] or all these organizations are suddenly\n[32:49] so interested in building all of these\n[32:50] massive state graphs and dependencies\n[32:52] between states\n[32:54] >> because AI can easily gro it properly.\n[32:56] >> Exactly. Because if you want to build an\n[32:58] NLM agent, every single organization\n[33:00] right now is positioning themselves like\n[33:02] we have the context. We've got all of\n[33:04] the information about your\n[33:05] infrastructure to for you to query.\n[33:08] >> Context is king.\n[33:09] >> Exactly. So, so on one side, Terra team\n[33:13] announces state graph, perfect for\n[33:15] building a context. Digger is like we're\n[33:17] building the state manager because you\n[33:19] need to be able, you know, we we need to\n[33:21] be able to query, you know, keep track\n[33:22] of dependencies, right? Yeah. We all\n[33:24] want to keep track of dependencies, use\n[33:25] our product, right? And and then the big\n[33:28] announcement on Wednesday, I think a day\n[33:30] before Hashikov, Digger opens uh this\n[33:33] very aggressive video. If you go to\n[33:36] digger.dev/opentaco, dev/open taco.\n[33:38] That's basically where the project was\n[33:40] an open taco.\n[33:43] So, a couple of things I remember from\n[33:44] that video.\n[33:46] Um, basically they start with like this\n[33:49] kind of like apocalyptic error messages\n[33:52] like people are being held hostages,\n[33:54] resource under management pricing is\n[33:56] criminal. Um, you know, this is not an\n[33:59] open standard. Um, and we have the\n[34:01] solution. We are building the future of\n[34:04] uh infrastructure as code. the open\n[34:06] standard. You see the first line there\n[34:08] introducing project open taco the open\n[34:11] standard for terraform open automation\n[34:14] right and then scroll down there's like\n[34:16] this road map the pillars I think the\n[34:19] pillars are are amazing the state\n[34:20] manager is the first thing that we just\n[34:21] talked about right then they said well\n[34:23] you need a private registry for modules\n[34:25] you need rolebased access control you\n[34:27] need to define your dependencies between\n[34:28] your stacks and you need to have uh\n[34:30] insights right reality map to code and\n[34:32] all that\n[34:33] >> cool I I really like um sites that like\n[34:36] advertise their principles or pillars or\n[34:39] whatever.\n[34:40] >> It's I think it's a it's a really nice\n[34:42] idea. Um\n[34:43] >> but the the response\n[34:47] >> w\n[34:49] even the negative responses can be\n[34:51] capitalized on. Right.\n[34:53] >> Okay. Well, okay. Let's look at what\n[34:55] happened next. Right.\n[34:56] >> What happened next?\n[35:18] Heat. Heat.\n[35:29] [Music]\n[35:35] Heat. Hey, Heat.\n[35:45] Heat. Heat.\n[35:47] [Music]\n[36:26] What happened next is they posted this\n[36:28] on Reddit and\n[36:31] and they posted on on on Hacker News. I\n[36:33] think on Hackin News they had three\n[36:35] uploads. I keep track of all the links\n[36:37] and on Reddit there was an immediate uh\n[36:40] you know very strong backlash from the\n[36:42] community. Um there's a few Reddit\n[36:45] accounts that were you know linked to\n[36:48] organizations I me mentioned before\n[36:51] >> and they were very critical. They were\n[36:53] like why do you talk about an open\n[36:55] standard like doesn't the standard\n[36:56] involve communication and like\n[36:58] contribution and a community like where\n[37:00] is the discussion? where is the you know\n[37:02] the RF the request for uh comments the\n[37:05] RFC where is it you know the\n[37:07] specification design um and why does it\n[37:10] is it like declared as the open standard\n[37:13] but is does it look like a product like\n[37:15] there's a product road map even like how\n[37:18] is this an open standard how can you\n[37:19] declare to be the standard when you\n[37:21] haven't like you know there's no\n[37:22] community behind it right\n[37:25] >> and I personally didn't really see that\n[37:27] but like apparently that that resonated\n[37:28] with a lot of people because that was\n[37:30] pretty much like there weren't that many\n[37:32] comments maybe 10 and like four out of\n[37:35] them or maybe 50 50% I mean were like\n[37:38] this is a product stop you know making\n[37:40] it look like it's an open standard uh\n[37:43] it's a product blah blah blah right so\n[37:45] they open source the source code uh and\n[37:47] one of the main things that's\n[37:48] interesting is they completely integrate\n[37:50] with the Terraform cloud uh back end so\n[37:52] if you're familiar with Terraform as a\n[37:54] back end you can use S3 you can use um\n[37:57] Postgress you can use an HTTP remote\n[37:59] backend or You can use Terapform cloud.\n[38:02] So the Teraphform cloud back end is a\n[38:03] very strict protocol that uses like\n[38:05] authentication. So you use Terapform\n[38:07] login when you run Terapform plan. You\n[38:09] can even have it remote.\n[38:11] >> So it uses the same back end.\n[38:12] Interesting.\n[38:12] >> And they implemented the Terapform cloud\n[38:15] back end because it's like you know\n[38:16] Terapform code is open source right\n[38:18] source available. So people replicated\n[38:21] all the API endpoints that Terapform\n[38:22] uses and they implemented the back end\n[38:24] of their own version. And that was like\n[38:26] whoa cool. They use the whole Terraform\n[38:27] back end. They have like SSO\n[38:29] integration. quite small. So they\n[38:32] >> and then yeah\n[38:33] >> the creator of F or open terraform like\n[38:37] cloud back end comes in and says\n[38:39] >> okay guys I expect in this day and age\n[38:41] you you know people copy code but you\n[38:43] guys do it without like any attribution\n[38:44] and you can't even be bothered to to\n[38:46] change the comments like you literally\n[38:48] copy the file from my project\n[38:51] >> with the original comments right in it.\n[38:53] >> What is the project name? F\n[38:56] >> yeah.\n[38:57] >> Ouch. Ouch. Indeed.\n[39:01] Yeah. Leg zero uh leg 100f comes into\n[39:05] the Reddit comment and says, \"I'm the\n[39:06] creator of F. You guys lifted my files.\n[39:09] >> I didn't even know about I didn't even\n[39:10] know about this project. This is\n[39:12] interesting.\" Ah,\n[39:13] >> I bring I bring receipts. I have links\n[39:15] to all of these Reddit comments. I can\n[39:17] share them.\n[39:17] >> So, there was definitely some hot\n[39:19] controversy.\n[39:21] >> H Yeah. The funny thing is that most of\n[39:24] the like harsh backlash\n[39:28] um I can always link back to the same\n[39:29] accounts.\n[39:31] It's always like two accounts that are\n[39:33] always going like you guys say you're no\n[39:34] standard but this is a product code. You\n[39:36] guys are breaking the trust of open\n[39:38] source code.\n[39:39] >> You hinted about it earlier but like on\n[39:41] Reddit um I mean I have one account on\n[39:43] Reddit and I stick to that one account\n[39:44] but I know loads of people that have at\n[39:46] least two or three accounts on Reddit.\n[39:48] two people going at it from four\n[39:50] accounts\n[39:51] >> and the and the moderator because what\n[39:53] happened to the post the big\n[39:54] announcement of open taco it got deleted\n[39:57] got removed I'm very curious now like\n[40:00] why unless like I'm very oblivious\n[40:03] >> unless I'm really oblivious and and I\n[40:05] really don't see that much as a really\n[40:07] bad like situation I look at this from\n[40:09] like docker point of view right docker\n[40:11] came in they built contain Linux\n[40:13] containers they built a whole tool\n[40:14] framework around it and then OCI was\n[40:17] created open container their initiative\n[40:18] they created the standard. So for me\n[40:21] like if you look at open taco it's a\n[40:23] product and you can like create a\n[40:25] standard out of a product like docker\n[40:27] did right and being so aggressive and\n[40:29] saying you but okay I understand that\n[40:31] there is first of the message like the\n[40:33] YouTube was very aggressive then second\n[40:36] the um you know declaring they are the\n[40:38] open standard that clearly like upset a\n[40:41] lot of people right then obviously the\n[40:44] massive failure of having this um you\n[40:47] know code that happened So what was the\n[40:50] response of um of of Digger to this uh\n[40:53] backlash and the post being removed?\n[40:55] >> A apology, right? So they did an apology\n[40:57] post\n[40:58] >> where\n[40:59] >> um\n[40:59] >> Oh, let me\n[41:01] >> Oh,\n[41:03] >> postmorton open taco using code from\n[41:06] without attribution. This is the chain\n[41:08] of events.\n[41:10] >> This is how it happened. We we we did a\n[41:14] stub five Y's\n[41:16] um and they post it. So I I want to hear\n[41:19] your opinion about what you feel about\n[41:21] this this this um\n[41:23] >> so why did the the code was moved from\n[41:25] as is from an internal\n[41:27] okay that doesn't really excuse anything\n[41:29] why\n[41:30] >> and they open source the internal to\n[41:31] full to show the full commit history of\n[41:33] how that was built when it was built who\n[41:35] was doing the PRs and all that\n[41:37] >> it still doesn't explain yeah\n[41:44] because I'm curious how you would feel\n[41:46] about this because the the response was\n[41:48] also Interesting.\n[41:56] Well, I mean,\n[41:59] I'm Is it Is it called Akams Akum's\n[42:02] razor? You know, don't attribute malice\n[42:05] to what could be excused as, you know,\n[42:09] incompetence.\n[42:11] Is that is that the right phrase? um\n[42:14] razor is is more about like if if\n[42:17] something if there's a simpler\n[42:18] explanation then that's the right\n[42:20] explanation but don't attribute malice\n[42:22] to what could be attributed to like\n[42:24] stupidity or or incompetence that's uh\n[42:27] that's some I don't know exactly what\n[42:30] >> okay something else but um I I would\n[42:32] probably go on the more positive side of\n[42:34] things because because uh you know like\n[42:39] when you're in a hurry and they're\n[42:40] ripping code from there I mean it could\n[42:43] This is even more the case with AI\n[42:45] nowadays. Like it wouldn't be surprised\n[42:47] me if you're writing some code with AI\n[42:50] and it just steals some code from some\n[42:52] code base on GitHub and then and then\n[42:54] you're taking flak because like uh you\n[42:58] have a comment from another GitHub repo\n[43:01] and I'll be like, \"Oh shit.\" It sounds\n[43:03] like they've fixed this issue, I'm\n[43:05] guessing. So\n[43:07] I I mean it's it's a mistake. It's a\n[43:10] balls up, but I wouldn't uh I would move\n[43:13] on from it. That's my initial feeling.\n[43:17] >> Right. The response was this is just\n[43:20] another product marketing, not really an\n[43:23] apology. Half of your apology talks\n[43:26] about the product or something like\n[43:28] that. Like I'm trying to find the\n[43:29] thread. Yes. And you can guess who was\n[43:32] putting those comments. The same people.\n[43:34] >> So this is where we are. I mean, how\n[43:36] long ago was this? 26th of September.\n[43:38] >> That was Saturday. Yeah. Okay. That's\n[43:40] This is hot hot hot\n[43:43] steaming gossip\n[43:45] tea. I've been like I've been having a\n[43:48] ball this weekend, you know? I was\n[43:49] literally eating popcorn like what's\n[43:51] going to happen next?\n[43:53] Whoa, this happened. Like um I honestly\n[43:57] like my personal opinion.\n[44:00] I mean, I don't really think it's fair\n[44:04] the the way that it's being um responded\n[44:07] to. Maybe I'm biased because I really\n[44:10] want something like this to exist. And\n[44:13] um yeah, I know of course\n[44:17] the the main like post the main the main\n[44:20] complaint of of the people complaining\n[44:22] was like, you know, trust in open source\n[44:24] has been eroded constantly. Projects are\n[44:27] relicensing. Um you know people are very\n[44:30] reluctant to to adopt a project now and\n[44:34] we need to build trust and trust is\n[44:35] earned by doing things right and\n[44:38] stealing code and you know relicensing\n[44:40] it because is a modilla public license\n[44:43] and digger and therefore the open taco\n[44:46] code as well is actually Apache 2\n[44:48] license so you can't rely it there's no\n[44:50] attribution so there's like so many nos\n[44:53] in this in this action like this\n[44:55] completely destroys trust this is\n[44:56] unacceptable So, so wait a minute.\n[44:59] >> Uh, Vincent, their repo was open source\n[45:02] too, right?\n[45:04] >> No. So, they Well, yes, they they moved\n[45:07] the they moved the open taco into their\n[45:09] main repository. Um, which is a massive\n[45:12] Golang monor repo. So, if you go to\n[45:15] digger. So, the actual\n[45:17] >> where is the\n[45:18] >> this is the open taco.\n[45:20] >> So, this is where they stole the co the\n[45:21] code, right? that they\n[45:22] >> this is the this is the internal one\n[45:24] that did they did some quick PC on the\n[45:26] internal code and then they copied all\n[45:28] of that into their main digger\n[45:31] repository. So this is the open taco\n[45:32] that was private\n[45:34] >> and then there's if uh there was it\n[45:37] wasn't into their internal if you go\n[45:38] back to their profile and you go to\n[45:40] their main monor repo the main one\n[45:42] there. So there you have the license\n[45:43] zone I guess\n[45:44] >> which is Apache 2.\n[45:46] >> Oh it's MIT.\n[45:47] >> Oh it's better even.\n[45:50] Um,\n[45:52] okay. Well, thanks for the gossip. I\n[45:54] think I got a a taste of uh the what do\n[45:58] you call it? The digestion system of\n[46:02] Terraform or something. You know, what's\n[46:04] going around and what's going to come\n[46:06] out. And\n[46:06] >> I I I like some of the like first off, I\n[46:09] think the name is the name is very funny\n[46:11] because you know, you have open tofu,\n[46:12] you have the concept of tacos and then\n[46:14] open taco kind of plays on that open to.\n[46:16] >> So So who coined tacos then? What's the\n[46:20] >> tacos is a known way of describing\n[46:23] Terraform automation and collaboration\n[46:24] software? Tacos has been around for like\n[46:27] two.\n[46:28] >> So like if I search for like tacos\n[46:31] site hashp.com\n[46:35] do they\n[46:36] >> sure\n[46:38] don't think they call it tacos but space\n[46:40] lift zero and so on. If you search for\n[46:42] like terome automation, then you're\n[46:44] going to find a lot of like websites\n[46:46] that refer to that as tacos,\n[46:49] >> right? Taco provider like Spaceelift.\n[46:52] Yeah. So, they do have it on but it's on\n[46:54] the discussion. It's on their forum.\n[46:55] It's not\n[46:55] >> interesting. Interesting.\n[46:57] >> Yeah.\n[46:57] >> Well, anyway, that that was a really\n[46:58] good conversation. I think I I need to\n[47:01] um transition into work. Uh, I got stuff\n[47:05] to\n[47:06] to uh cards cards to move into different\n[47:10] lanes and stuff like that.\n[47:12] >> So, anyway, if anyone is watching this\n[47:14] to this far, I congratulate you. Okay.\n[47:17] All the best, Vincent. Let's catch up.\n[47:20] >> Some links if you want to add it in some\n[47:22] links.\n[47:22] >> Yeah, context is king. Context is king.\n[47:25] >> Yeah, but it's more to discuss. We\n[47:27] definitely have to do another session.\n[47:28] >> Yeah, we definitely have to do another\n[47:30] session. Okay, great. See you, man.\n[47:32] >> Okay. All right.",

(Re-Upload)\nSite: YouTube\nPage description: Vincent De Smet is working on https://terraconstructs.dev/Opentaco trailer from https://www.linkedin.com/posts/izalutski_today-i-am-excited-to-announce-digge...\n</context>\n\n<content>\nTranscript:\nThe following is a conversation with\nVincent Smith on the latest developments\naround Terraform.\nSorry, I I couldn't resist the Lex\nFriedman inspired introduction.\nWell, I know Vincent from uh Singapore.\nHe's he's out there somewhere in Asia.\nHe's a he's a thorough veteran of all\nthings infrastructure, as am I. I'm\nbased in the UK\nand an infrastructure engineer is my day\njob. What is an infrastructure engineer?\nI help run those software services that\nyou use. I sort of help uh provision\nthose cloud and manage and govern those\ncloud services usually AWS.\nAnd uh what one way to provision those\nresources is with a popular uh project\ncalled Terraform which fairly recently\nuh got bought by IBM and relicicensed uh\nunder like a commercial license. So the\nthing that everyone uses the terraform\nis now uh in a sort of a interesting\nplace and the conversation um that\nfollows is Vince and I just chatting\nabout it and hopefully you enjoy it.\nPlease comment below and um I will uh\ntry my best to answer all your\nquestions. Thank you.\n>> So what's the tea?\n>> What's the tea? So you had some you had\nsome juicy infrastructure gossip.\n>> Okay. So maybe some background like\nthere's quite a few companies built\naround Terraform.\nSome of them being Space Lift, M0, you\nknow, you know the whole deal with the\nthe licensing change around Terraform\nand um a lot of companies forking the\nlast uh Mozilla public licensed version\nof Terraform and then maintaining it as\na fork under open tofu. Right.\n>> Right. And um aside from those\ncompanies, there's also Digger. I'm not\nsure how much Digger.dev is involved in\nthis open TOFU effort. I'm not sure\nactually who are the founding companies\nbehind Open Tofu. Um the the the term\nTaco Terapform automation TA\ncollaboration CO and software. So Tacos,\nright? T A C O S Terafform automation\ncollaboration software.\n>> Okay. Okay.\n>> Okay. So a lot of this Terapform\nautomation and collaboration software\nexamples are Teraphform Cloud where you\npush code into Git and then it triggers\na a run of Terapform plan and apply. Um\nand and so Atlantis is a famous uh open\nsource tacos.\n>> Yeah, I I just have Digger open right\nnow and it looks like it just reminds me\nof Atlantis.\n>> Yeah, so Digger is an alternative to\nAtlantis with the premise being why do I\nneed a separate EC2 instance when I hub\na whole bunch of CI/CD runners. So what\nthey do is they give you CI/CD workflows\nfor um GitLab and GitHub actions and\nthen they simply have an orchestration\nAPI that those runner workflows can you\nknow be orchestrated with. So whenever\num a an event comes into the GitHub, it\nmaybe triggers through the orchestration\nlayer and the orchestration layer would\nthen dispatch uh dispatch uh GitHub\nworkflow. So it actually uses your\nGitHub runners that you may have\nself-hosted or that you are having part\nof your GitHub hosting to to run the\nterraform jobs, right? You don't have a\nseparate terapform instance. So\n>> so their view on how is is the minimal\nlike impact like the easiest fit into\nexisting uh company um workflows. So\nthey build digger in that uh frame and\nthen they mentioned like you know what's\nreally missing and a big problem with\nAtlantis as well is the ability to just\nmanage the orchestration. So Hashi Hashi\nconference happened last week where\nHashikov is going to make a lot of\nannouncements. So there was actually\nquite a lot of um things or news\nhappening around Hashik um from other\ncompanies trying to you know use the\nevent to also\n>> Wow, that must be such a cool event.\nAtlanta. Okay, cool.\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yep.\n>> So So last year on Hashicon they\nannounced\nuh stack beta. I think the two years ago\nthey announced uh terraform stacks\nprivate beta and then public beta and\nnow it's finally ga general available.\nSo what is terraform stacks? Steraphhone\nstacks is basically the the ability to\ndefine multiple terraform states in one\nstack. So that they for example a common\nscenario is you have a network and then\nyou have a Kubernetes cluster and then\nyou have some Argo CD deployment that\nneeds to depend on that Kubernetes\ncluster right so you can\nthose are all all individual components\nright the network has to exist and\ncreate all the subnets private and\npublic subnets for the application nodes\nto be provisioned in. So the Kubernetes\ncluster can only be created after the\nnetwork has been created. So Terapform\nSTS will help you to orchestrate across\nmultiple terapform states.\n>> So this is something that is cloud only,\nright? They will this is not part of the\nTerapform CLI until the most recent\nrelease where you can actually use the\nTerraform CLI to query the cloud stacks.\nBut cloud stacks is cloud only except\nfor some CLI to get some information\nabout your stacks. But but wait a\nminute, Terraform must have had this\nfeature before to depend on another\nstack for another I mean you could you\ncan fish out values from another\n>> Yes, you can fish out values and I\nbelieve they just use workspaces and\noutputs between workspaces but they\ndidn't have a crossworkspace\norchestration uh um feature as far as\nI'm aware.\n>> What what does orchestration mean like\nlike a like a like a\n>> this coordination\n>> like depends on on things like this?\n>> Yes. like I want to provision a new\nenvironment and that environment\nconsists of a network, a cluster and a\ngithops controller and the uh network\nneeds to be created first then the\ncluster then the controller. Okay.\n>> So yeah\n>> so when you say orchestration I'm just\nlike mapping it into GitHub workflows.\nYeah. But okay carry on. when yeah when\nI say orchestration I mean like\ncoordination between different um you\nknow activities that need to be ran and\nand you know orchestrated you know the\nevents between them that trigger the\nactivities or actions to be\n>> executable something\nmaybe more like a make file in my you\nknow Dumbo brain you know\n>> a make file gives you a couple of that's\nmore like a task runner right a make\nfile gives you a couple of targets to\nexecute and then you you are the\norchestrator usually that says first I\nneed to run this make file has like some\nminimum orchestration\n>> well it has like files so you you you\nsay like you know I need this file food\nto be built before this file bar so so\nit it will run the target for fu but to\nbe honest make files are never quite\nused that way but uh anyway we're\ngetting distracted here so orchestration\nI'm I'm I'm all aboard on GA\n>> all right so there's been GA now great\num however\nA lot of these Terraform automation and\ncollaborations software or tacos have\nswitched to a resource under management\npricing mechanism where you're being\ncharged for every resource that um they\nmanage for you and so if you have a lot\nof Terraform resources then you are\ngetting a very big bill over time right\n>> yeah yeah I mean that's that's really\nevident in my current client with data\ndog I mean when when you look at each\nresource cost. It's cheap,\n>> but when you have a zillion resources\nand the sprawling cloud of which you\ninevitably do, it's really expensive,\n>> right? So, one of the arguments\nof um you know the advantage of of using\na a collaboration software like you can\nuse Atlantis, you can run it selfhosted\num but it doesn't really do cross tech\norchestration all this tech feature\ndoesn't exist. Um, so I've also\npersonally been thinking like how do I\nadd on orchestration on top of Atlantis\nfor example because Atlantis whenever\nyou open a pull request it will um\nidentify any GitHub um it will use git\nto identify any changes like based on\nthe pull request compare compared to the\nbase. It will identify which terraform\nprojects may have changed. It can auto\ndetect that or you can be very explicit\non how it needs to track which projects\nneed to be run and where those projects\nlive. Um and then Terraform will\nbasically try to run all of those\nprojects. If you want, you can auto\nplan. So every time a pull request is\nopened, it will auto plan any projects\nit believes that may have changed and it\nruns them all at the same time. So\nobviously if you make a pull request\nthat creates three different components\nand they depend on each other, then one\nof them will plan successfully, the rest\nof them will fail because the other\ncomponents don't exist, right? So you\nhave the ability to do some type of\norchestration if you manually um define\nor uh execution groups. So Atlantis has\nthe ability to say execution group one\nand then execution group two then\nexecution group three. A little bit like\nArgo CD uh deployment waves. Uh it's the\nsame same.\n>> Okay. Yeah.\n>> Uh it's execution order group.\n>> Okay. Wow.\n>> Yeah. So it's for ordering. And then uh\nabout two years ago another PR came in\nwhich was the ability to define\ndependency. So you uh which basically\nyou can use order group to determine\nwhen to run the which projects only\nafter a certain other projects have been\nrun. And then the dependency was that uh\nAtlantis would fail or bail if uh one of\nthe projects dependencies hasn't been\napplied yet. So it has a very basic\ntracking of of of a project. It says\nlike okay this one is planned this one\nis uh\n>> applied\n>> um and and if it tries to if you try to\nrun a plan and it and the dependencies\nhave not been resolved it will fail\nbecause it has these dependencies of\nother projects that must be um you know\nresolved first. Yeah. But in in reality\nthose two concepts don't really map\ndirectly to like the ability to\norchestrate like to say uh run this and\nthen run that right. Um because that\nshould be sufficient to just say\ndependency. You don't need execution\ngroup and dependency. treat it\nseparately. One is to make sure the\ndependency has been resolved. One is to\nmake sure that one\n>> I mean ordering is like very basic uh\nyou know you're you're on a maturity\njourney that that's when I see people\ndoing that that's like very basic. It's\nlike kind of manual but when you have a\na proper tool like any like make or\ndepend or or an orchestrator as you say\nthen it becomes\n>> spacelift or m0 they all have the\nability to do that even teragrant like\neven teragrant within the repository you\ncan define dependencies between your\nterafr grunt um you know states and then\nyou uh teragrant can do a run all uh to\norchestrate it so basically run\neverything in in in order so it\n>> it basically builds a graph\nuh across your different Terraform\nstates. So, so within a diff within a\nTerraform state, Terraform builds a\ngraph between the resources, right? this\nresource need to be created and then it\nthat resource depends on it and then and\nit does its own parallelization and like\nexecution and and sometimes you need to\nbe you need to terraform you need to\ntell terraform hey actually you know\nthere's like for example an API gateway\nwhen you create the API gateway and all\nof its integrations in AWS um if you\nthen try to trigger an API uh gateway\ndeployment if that if that uh actual\nintegration hasn't been resolved or\ndoesn't or the lambda hasn't been\nattached and you trigger the deployment\nit will fail AWS API I will say got it\n>> this gateway doesn't have a an\nintegration so it will fail and and in\nthat case there's no direct dependency\nbecause the deployment has a dependency\nimplicit dependency on the gateway\nbecause you use the gateway ID uh the\nAPI gateway identity so when you you use\nthat link terapform knows I need to\ncreate a gateway then I need to create\nthe deployment but it does not have an\nexplicit dependency between the\ndeployment and for example an\nintegration on the gateway so when when\nyou don't do that then um you get a race\ncondition. So it may manifest um\nsometimes it may not manifest right u\nbut but the right way is to really say\nlike okay this deployment also depends\non these other resources you know and\nyou have to explicitly say it depends on\nthis gateway integration with this\nlambda and so on right\n>> yeah got it\n>> so that that becomes very um that works\nreally well with terraform within a\nterraform state\n>> so terapform is amazing um in handling\nthese resource dependencies sometimes\nyou have to give it a little bit of a\nhint uh now from a higher level outside\nof the state. Um, creating dependencies\nbetween states adds a lot of like\nadditional orchestration overhead that\nmakes it difficult sometimes. Like one\nof the most common problem is I'm going\nto change my network for example and I'm\ngoing to change my output and now my\nsubnets are no longer a map of key value\npairs. Maybe they become an ordered list\nand then maybe I have another component\nwhich reads a key and then gets an error\nbecause there's no longer a map there.\nit's\nright I understand the complexity\n>> that happens um so why do people\nseparate everything right why why do\nthey create one state for the network\none state for the cluster and that's\noften because of like life cycle um or\nownership\n>> right\n>> yeah so a network usually has a much\nlonger life cycle than the clusters\nwithin or even the deployments on on\nclusters\n>> I mean I usually say blast radius to to\nto clients like that's why we have so\nmany goddamn stacks.\n>> Yes. Uh blast radius and um with that is\nalso for example if you use and again\nthis comes back to like a lot of\ndiscussions within the terraform space\nwhich is like do I always uh only apply\nafter I merge. So um you know only apply\noff the master branch or do I like do I\nallow people to run apply from a from a\nbranch and basically the branch is\nmodifying the states which is shared\nbetween the master branch and then if\nsomebody runs an apply then they may\nlike inadvertently undo my changes\nbecause my merged yet right\n>> I see that all the time in my current\nclient we have a channel called\nTerraform stack wars or something like\nthat people basically announce that I'm\ngoing to make a change to the monitoring\nstack or the networking stack.\nand then they create a branch and imply\nit in dev and uh of course people need\nto somehow lock it so that they don't\nstamp on each other\n>> right so Atlantis has a very good\nfeature there and a lot of organizations\nfollow Atlantis way of doing things\nwhich is as soon as you open a pull\nrequest and Atlantis runs a plan it\nbasically keeps a lock on that\nparticular state\n>> so if another pull request goes against\nthat particular state like Atlantis\ndetects a project and and tries to plan\nit, it will get an error saying, \"Oh,\nthis pull request number 34 owned by\nVincent owns the lock on this particular\nproject.\nThe lock is quite needs to be quite long\nlived because like\n>> as long as the PR holds the lock so it's\nin a database like like an object\ndatabase keeping track of the lock and\num and so basically until somebody goes\nin and clears the lock from that PR that\nPR holds the lock.\n>> Nice.\n>> Right. And that's because Atlantis tries\nto be deterministic. So when you when it\nauto plans it will write a plan on disk\nand when somebody approves it he will\napprove exactly that plan that run right\nand if something changes um for whatever\nreason if you if you try to trigger an\napply and you know Terraform tries to\nand this is a terapform feature right\nAtlantis passes the previously generated\nand approved plan from disk into the\nTerraform apply and then the Terapform\nwill immediately reject it if it\ndiscovers that something changed and the\nplan is no longer valid. So the plan has\nbecome stale. So then you need to like\nrerun plan to get an approval. It can be\n>> depending depending you can be flex. You\ncan say as soon as it you know the PR\nhas received one one approval it's okay.\nYou can use the GitHub approval\nrequirements um you know whenever a\ncommit is pushed maybe it invalidates\nthe PR. So you use the you know your uh\nversion control um gates on your pull\nrequest.\n>> Yeah.\nIt sounds like Atlantis has been\nevolving over the years that I I mean I\nhaven't used it. Uh so that sounds good.\nI mean does it have does Atlantis for\nexample have a feature where if you\ndon't destroy anything like you know if\nthen just approves\n>> that like some sort of policy is\n>> auto approval.\n>> Um\nthat's not actually no not that I'm\naware of. It's probably possible but it\nwould I mean technically everything is\npossible right but it would require a\nlittle bit of additional I don't have\nany um such setup currently\n>> but this is definitely like another\nrequirement that um people ask it's like\nwhenever like I want an auto approve or\nan auto deploy flow so I want Atlantis\napproval to automatically happen and\n>> yeah I mean I mean and there's probably\nthere's probably AI in the mix here you\nknow like\n>> you don't know I would avoid AI in those\nsituations to be honest.\n>> Well, I've I've been using Copilot in\nGitHub Copilot um as a reviewer in in\nPRs in in the team and I'm actually\nquite surprised how good it is in some\nways. It's it's better than any like I\nmean is it better it complements any\nlike linting tool and things like this,\ndoesn't it?\n>> We can go deeper on like all of the\nthings that we can do with context\nbecause this really relates to the tea\nthat I want to talk about.\n>> Okay. Okay.\n>> Okay.\n>> Oh my god. 20 minutes in. Yeah. So, so\nyou you'll have to edit this heavily,\nbut we've basically explained some of\nthe, you know, options because what you\njust mentioned is we have some manual\ncoordination to lock PRs. Atlantis does\nthat for you. Um, but this means that\nAtlantis locks the PR and then it has a\napply before merge philosophy and a lot\nof organizations are like this is\nunacceptable. uh you know trunk is the\nsource of truth and um we cannot have\nanything applied until it landed on\ntrunk that's where it should be\n>> merge uh okay\n>> yeah because Atlantis keeps the lock on\nthe PR as soon as everything is applied\nwithin the PR then that needs to be\nmerged as soon as possible needs to go\ninto trunk right because now the state\nfile reflects whatever is on that branch\nyeah and if that is not merged and\nsomebody you know runs Terafform from\ntrunk from their laptop without you know\nhaving this at\n>> I Atlant's lock is purely on the\nAtlantic side. It doesn't\n>> contentious but it doesn't it doesn't\nseem like such a big deal to me really\nbecause you're working.\n>> Yeah. So some organizations are very\nstrict and so some uh some workflows\nthey they say apply before merge is\nincorrect. It should be merge and then\napply. So my main I am from the Atlantis\nlike I grew up with Atlantis. that glad\nthis solved a lot of my problems and and\nfor me I have experienced many times\nthat the plan looks perfect but when you\ntry to apply it fails right for whatever\nreason because you know a terapform plan\ndoesn't really validate like\n>> yeah yeah yeah\n>> I guess I guess terraform crud reads\nonly the attributes and then does this\ninternal validation of like this needs\nto change and then um the actual ter AWS\nprovider may get an invalid response I\nmean to be honest I I prefer a workflow\nwhere we don't even plan because because\n>> plan doesn't catch probably I'm making a\ncrazy figure about AI it plan doesn't\ncatch like 80% of the the issues that\nyou might get when you when you're\ndeploying infrastructure. I mean it it\nit doesn't really help you move fast. Um\n>> okay right so so so there's just I\nwanted to highlight that Atlantis is one\nsolution. It lacks a lot of the\norchestrations, gives you a lot of other\nstuff. Um,\n>> and it's open source and it's it's it's\neasy. You don't have to worry about\n>> can run it on $15 EC2 instance. You can\ngo to the digger docs where they go into\nlike pretty good arguments against it\nsaying like, well, you know, it's never\njust one Atlantis instance. They have\nlike a a doc where they compare the\nproblems with Atlantis. I believe they\nsay uh Atlantis is never Yeah. compared\nto Atlantis. I like their arguments.\nIt's like it's never just one instance.\nWhere is\nI can't see it now. But there was or\nmaybe I I remember it from another um\ntacos. Uh\n>> but but since but since Atlas is just\ndoesn't is is not like cloud pricing. I\nmean that's a huge win in my book. They\ndon't even mention the price. I I talk\nto to friends of mine that are running,\nyou know, 10 thousands of Terraform\nresources of, you know, very big scale\nand when they look at any RUM quotes,\nit's just like blows up their cloud bill\nbecause it's it goes from I'm I'm paying\n$20 a month from a, you know, a decent\nEC2 instance running Atlantis or\nrunning, you know, on a Kubernetes\ncontainer. So, it's even less um, you\nknow, CPU memory usage and I can, you\nknow, so I'm not paying anything right\nnow. I'm paying like 20 bucks max and\nI'm going to be facing $10,000 a month\nif I switch to like the cloud just\nbecause I want that like additional\npolicy as code or I want additional\norchestration features or arbback like\nthat's not in Atlantis right you don't\nhave proper arback you can do like some\ncode owner setup with your GitHub PRs to\nyou know only validate that if that\nperson approves then it can be applied\nwe do some conf test in my organization\nwhere we we do invalidate like or we\nblock a PR if there's any changes to an\nIM policy so that the security has to\ncome in and review these changes to IM\npolicies for example. So we have some\nconf test like that\n>> some some routings going on.\n>> Yes and conf test is also um like\nhardcoded into Atlantis right you can\nAtlantis has their own workflows and the\ndefault workflows includes confest so it\nruns an OPA um policy against your um\nTerapform plan but if you don't want to\nuse confest you can use other OPA or um\nother scanners. I I don't think I've\neven used comp like like why is it\nclaiming to be\n>> secure by design and\n>> uh maybe because when you run Atlantis\nyou're running an EC2 instance that may\nthat has a lot of permissions like an IM\npolicy that has administrative like uh\npermissions and maybe that's like you\nyou are responsible for securing your\nAtlantis because your Atlantis in the\nend is the one that takes or assumes the\nprofile to make all the cloud changes\nand then that instance It's quite normal\nthough. That's pretty normal.\n>> Yeah, it's\n>> and so I mean it's\n>> because you're hosting an EC2 instance,\nyou need to like you can't make it\npublicly accessible, but it needs to\nreceive GitHub web hook. So it must have\nsome ingress path for\n>> conversely, I'm I'm assuming that if\nyou're using digger, you have to hand\nover the crown jewels to digger just\nlike CICD to to the ter.\n>> No, they don't. So, so they are purely\nlike the orchestration layer that just\ndispatches the the workers and your\nworkers are your CI/CD system. So, you\ncan you can have those hooked up to your\nGitHub like you have runners for for for\nstuff anyway, right? So, so basically\nthey hand off like\n>> I don't Okay. Okay. Let's let's get to\nthe the gossip then.\n>> Okay. So, so aside from Atlantis,\nthere's Digger, there's Spaceelift,\nthere's M0, there's Terot Team, there's\nquite a few. And so Digger has been\nposting these um thought experiments on\nReddit where they talk about the states\nmanager. What if a terraform\norchestration like Tacos wasn't a\nrunner? Like most of these like\nSpacelift, M0, they're all providing\nrunners um basically triggered by web\nhooks. But what if you decouple the\nrunner infrastructure and just focus on\nthe state management part? So the\nbiggest problem that we have because we\nare splitting states. Um the biggest\nproblem is how do we like manage the\ndependencies between states and and\nidentify you know if if one state\nchanges what else is impacted because\nfor example I make a change to my\nnetwork now I need to invalidate\neverything that depends on my network so\nit may need\n>> so so we we're go we're going back to\nTerraform stacks aren't we here if\nyou're talking about states\n>> it's kind of related to the stacks\nstacks capture the dependencies between\nstates but the argument from digger on\nReddit like the thought experiments were\nabout like let's imagine an API that you\nonly use it to define dependencies\nbetween your states and it gives you\nendpoints to you know identify any stale\nstates. So a state that needs to be\nreplanned because something it depends\non has changed. So basically track the\nedges, color the edges when outputs\nchange and then replan or like give an\nbasically give back a list of jobs to\nrun because there's these states need to\nrun, right?\n>> Color color the edges. That's an\ninteresting expression. Yeah.\n>> Color the Yeah. Um it literally what it\ndoes it's a a state multigraph because\nit keeps track of multiple edges between\nstates for each\n>> out. Where are these discussions\nhappening on terraform or something? on\nthe terraform subreddit which was like I\nthink posted around maybe June.\n>> Okay.\n>> So state management calendar edges I\nthink I'm I'm with you.\n>> Right. So so I was very interested and I\ntalked with um with with the the team\nbecause I'm building something that\nreally needs this state orchestration\nand not only the state orchestration but\nI need to hook into it because I\ngenerate terapform. So I want to be able\nto read the outputs and I want to be\nable to see what's the shape of an\noutput. So I want something that can\ngive me um or can help me track\ndependencies or outputs and then\nidentify what is the source of that\noutput and things like that. So I talked\nto them like hey um I want to know what\nyou guys like I'm interested to help\nbuild with this. So I had a call with\nthem and they presented to me uh\nsomething that was they were building in\nstealth at the time and they were just\nwanted to get some feedback and it was\ncalled open taco. Okay interesting. So\nthat was about like two weeks ago. Then\nnot much after Terra team the other\ntacos provider announced uh an\ninteresting project called state\ngraph.dev state graph.dev.\nYes. So terraform without the state file\nbottleneck. Like they their argument is\nbasically the the reason we are\nsplitting states is because we don't\nhave proper tools to manage our\nterapform state because the terraform\ntool is only able to manage a single\nstate. The real problem is if we were to\ncreate like a massive teralith basically\none big state where all of your\nenvironments are and then we improve the\nactual tooling around this single\nmassive state and we're able to like\nterraform apply uh slices of it and\nwe're able to you know control arbback\nof individual resources like we're able\nto track ownership and and approvals\nagainst the individual resources. we're\nable to solve a lot of the problems why\nwe are having this blast radius and and\nthese arguments.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I've been argument is\n>> yeah that I've been thinking this we\nneed like a monolithic\nkind of state\nthat problem.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So they announced like let's get\nrid of this state you know multi-state\nproblem. Um and at the same time you\nhave uh Tara Grant or Grunt Works\npromoting these uh kill the terit\nadvertisement or workshops. It's very\nfunny. My LinkedIn feed is like on one\nside Grunt Works you know advertising of\nkill the monolith uh kill the ter\n>> break\n>> breaking the ter\nworkshops and they're like um you know\nterits are killing you. You must have\nresponded like\n>> a monolithic terapform state.\n>> Well,\nno one ever does that but uh I don't see\nthe problem there.\ncompanies like Grunt works they're like\nconsultancy and they're going into a lot\nof places where people you know like in\nin-house develop their own terapform\nsetup and then they face all kind of\nissues and basically teragrant is quite\nextreme because when you use teragrant\nyou pretty much get one state per module\nso you build one module and then you\ninvoke that module and that's one state\nyou cannot like have multiple modules\nthis is a bit crazy right I mean if you\nimagine how small modules sometimes are\nI can tell you in a previous place I\nworked at we like three years of terror\ngrants and we had like 300 or 400\nterraform states. It was insane.\n>> So, so, so I don't understand. So, if\nthey do it in such a fragmented way,\nthen how can they claim that that the\nmonolithic terraform state is a problem?\n>> No, they're coming into organizations\nand they're saying, uh, we will help you\nbreak down your terror because all of\nyour problems are because of the terith.\n>> That's crazy to me, but okay.\n>> Right. And they have they also launched\na cloud product called Terra Terracale\nor Teragrant scale. So they they\nlaunched a product uh basically to\nmigrate you into and then orchestrate.\n>> Oh okay. So it's like a importing blah\nblah blah\n>> right. Okay. So so that was just an\nanecdote because I'm seeing on one site\num Terra team constantly posting about\ndon't break down your ter is not your\nproblem. The problem is the tooling. And\non the other side I have like grunt work\nsponsor saying we have workshops to help\nyou break down the term.\nYeah, I'm definitely in camp um state\ngraph. Definitely.\n>> Right. Yeah. So, so they hit hacker news\nuh front page the moment they posted\nthis and um they Yeah.\n>> Nine point. Oh, yeah.\n>> That one. Yeah. Like 13 days ago.\n>> That's quite respectable,\n>> right? And then they also got like the\nmailing like they they said they have\nhundreds of organizations interested.\nThey're looking for design partners to\nto help build out what people want from\na state graph and what it looks like.\nThey're even hiring Okamel developers,\nbut they won't train you. I try I asked\nthey said no, we don't have time to\ntrain you. Um, so you must know Okamel\nand then um they're building this their\nlaunch date, their road map is for\nquarter 16.\n>> Atlantis is written in what? Python, I\nguess, or something.\n>> Golang, a massive Golang source code.\nOh, nice.\n>> Quite complicated. I don't know about\nGolen for monolithic like\n>> it gets really complicated.\n>> It's not that comp. I love go.\n>> The problem with with Atlantis is that\nit's so ingrained into the pull request\nflow that everything is like based off\nthe idea that it's coming from a pull\nrequest event which is horrible. Like\nfor example, they try to add an API\nendpoint to run Terraform plans and it's\nreally painful because it like oh you\nhave a pull request, right? Where else\nare we going to run a plan on? Right.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's so\n>> okay. So but anyway, Atlantis is not\num sorry my my head space is in this\nwhole monolithic versus\n>> Atlantis doesn't really dictate how you\norganize your state. Yeah, you know has\nthis auto discovery to to find your hash\nyour terapform configuration files. You\neven have like integration with terror\nso that you can automatically like you\ncan let terror actually run the\nterraform across your like repository\nand then you can Atlantis can hand off\nsome of that. The most important part\nabout Atlantis is basically locking pull\nrequests posting plan into the\n>> requ. So um yeah so sorry I I'm just\ntrying to track in my brain. We talked\nabout Atlantis and Digger and now we're\ntalking about Sterraph and Terror Grant.\nWell, is there some relationship?\n>> Yes, the relationship is that Digger was\nposting all these thoughts experiment on\non on Reddit. Uh suddenly there's this\nannouncement of state graph. I found it\nquite funny because you know the terror\nteam is actually quite active on Reddit\nand I see them commenting on these posts\nand then I see them announcing state\ngraph and I thought like like it's quite\nsimilar. Uh so so I talked to them and I\nwas like that's interesting like I need\nsomething that I can query. So either\nit's it's the thing that digger is\nbuilding or it's the thing that um the\nterror terror team is building whichever\nright I need to query the state I want\nto know I want to retrieve information\n>> so yeah it's about it's between digger\nand state graph for you okay\n>> right right so hashik happened uh the\nweek last week hashik um is going to be\nby the end of the week at the start of\nthe week they announces we have some big\nannouncement this week we have a really\nbig announcement this week\n>> infograph\n>> infograph is announced Hashikov which is\nvery similar and again to the point of\nAI why do all of these people suddenly\nor all these organizations are suddenly\nso interested in building all of these\nmassive state graphs and dependencies\nbetween states\n>> because AI can easily gro it properly.\n>> Exactly. Because if you want to build an\nNLM agent, every single organization\nright now is positioning themselves like\nwe have the context. We've got all of\nthe information about your\ninfrastructure to for you to query.\n>> Context is king.\n>> Exactly. So, so on one side, Terra team\nannounces state graph, perfect for\nbuilding a context. Digger is like we're\nbuilding the state manager because you\nneed to be able, you know, we we need to\nbe able to query, you know, keep track\nof dependencies, right? Yeah. We all\nwant to keep track of dependencies, use\nour product, right? And and then the big\nannouncement on Wednesday, I think a day\nbefore Hashikov, Digger opens uh this\nvery aggressive video. If you go to\ndigger.dev/opentaco, dev/open taco.\nThat's basically where the project was\nan open taco.\nSo, a couple of things I remember from\nthat video.\nUm, basically they start with like this\nkind of like apocalyptic error messages\nlike people are being held hostages,\nresource under management pricing is\ncriminal. Um, you know, this is not an\nopen standard. Um, and we have the\nsolution. We are building the future of\nuh infrastructure as code. the open\nstandard. You see the first line there\nintroducing project open taco the open\nstandard for terraform open automation\nright and then scroll down there's like\nthis road map the pillars I think the\npillars are are amazing the state\nmanager is the first thing that we just\ntalked about right then they said well\nyou need a private registry for modules\nyou need rolebased access control you\nneed to define your dependencies between\nyour stacks and you need to have uh\ninsights right reality map to code and\nall that\n>> cool I I really like um sites that like\nadvertise their principles or pillars or\nwhatever.\n>> It's I think it's a it's a really nice\nidea. Um\n>> but the the response\n>> w\neven the negative responses can be\ncapitalized on. Right.\n>> Okay. Well, okay. Let's look at what\nhappened next. Right.\n>> What happened next?\nHeat. Heat.\n[Music]\nHeat. Hey, Heat.\nHeat. Heat.\n[Music]\nWhat happened next is they posted this\non Reddit and\nand they posted on on on Hacker News. I\nthink on Hackin News they had three\nuploads. I keep track of all the links\nand on Reddit there was an immediate uh\nyou know very strong backlash from the\ncommunity. Um there's a few Reddit\naccounts that were you know linked to\norganizations I me mentioned before\n>> and they were very critical. They were\nlike why do you talk about an open\nstandard like doesn't the standard\ninvolve communication and like\ncontribution and a community like where\nis the discussion? where is the you know\nthe RF the request for uh comments the\nRFC where is it you know the\nspecification design um and why does it\nis it like declared as the open standard\nbut is does it look like a product like\nthere's a product road map even like how\nis this an open standard how can you\ndeclare to be the standard when you\nhaven't like you know there's no\ncommunity behind it right\n>> and I personally didn't really see that\nbut like apparently that that resonated\nwith a lot of people because that was\npretty much like there weren't that many\ncomments maybe 10 and like four out of\nthem or maybe 50 50% I mean were like\nthis is a product stop you know making\nit look like it's an open standard uh\nit's a product blah blah blah right so\nthey open source the source code uh and\none of the main things that's\ninteresting is they completely integrate\nwith the Terraform cloud uh back end so\nif you're familiar with Terraform as a\nback end you can use S3 you can use um\nPostgress you can use an HTTP remote\nbackend or You can use Terapform cloud.\nSo the Teraphform cloud back end is a\nvery strict protocol that uses like\nauthentication. So you use Terapform\nlogin when you run Terapform plan. You\ncan even have it remote.\n>> So it uses the same back end.\nInteresting.\n>> And they implemented the Terapform cloud\nback end because it's like you know\nTerapform code is open source right\nsource available. So people replicated\nall the API endpoints that Terapform\nuses and they implemented the back end\nof their own version. And that was like\nwhoa cool. They use the whole Terraform\nback end. They have like SSO\nintegration. quite small. So they\n>> and then yeah\n>> the creator of F or open terraform like\ncloud back end comes in and says\n>> okay guys I expect in this day and age\nyou you know people copy code but you\nguys do it without like any attribution\nand you can't even be bothered to to\nchange the comments like you literally\ncopy the file from my project\n>> with the original comments right in it.\n>> What is the project name? F\n>> yeah.\n>> Ouch. Ouch. Indeed.\nYeah. Leg zero uh leg 100f comes into\nthe Reddit comment and says, \"I'm the\ncreator of F. You guys lifted my files.\n>> I didn't even know about I didn't even\nknow about this project. This is\ninteresting.\" Ah,\n>> I bring I bring receipts. I have links\nto all of these Reddit comments. I can\nshare them.\n>> So, there was definitely some hot\ncontroversy.\n>> H Yeah. The funny thing is that most of\nthe like harsh backlash\num I can always link back to the same\naccounts.\nIt's always like two accounts that are\nalways going like you guys say you're no\nstandard but this is a product code. You\nguys are breaking the trust of open\nsource code.\n>> You hinted about it earlier but like on\nReddit um I mean I have one account on\nReddit and I stick to that one account\nbut I know loads of people that have at\nleast two or three accounts on Reddit.\ntwo people going at it from four\naccounts\n>> and the and the moderator because what\nhappened to the post the big\nannouncement of open taco it got deleted\ngot removed I'm very curious now like\nwhy unless like I'm very oblivious\n>> unless I'm really oblivious and and I\nreally don't see that much as a really\nbad like situation I look at this from\nlike docker point of view right docker\ncame in they built contain Linux\ncontainers they built a whole tool\nframework around it and then OCI was\ncreated open container their initiative\nthey created the standard. So for me\nlike if you look at open taco it's a\nproduct and you can like create a\nstandard out of a product like docker\ndid right and being so aggressive and\nsaying you but okay I understand that\nthere is first of the message like the\nYouTube was very aggressive then second\nthe um you know declaring they are the\nopen standard that clearly like upset a\nlot of people right then obviously the\nmassive failure of having this um you\nknow code that happened So what was the\nresponse of um of of Digger to this uh\nbacklash and the post being removed?\n>> A apology, right? So they did an apology\npost\n>> where\n>> um\n>> Oh, let me\n>> Oh,\n>> postmorton open taco using code from\nwithout attribution. This is the chain\nof events.\n>> This is how it happened. We we we did a\nstub five Y's\num and they post it. So I I want to hear\nyour opinion about what you feel about\nthis this this um\n>> so why did the the code was moved from\nas is from an internal\nokay that doesn't really excuse anything\nwhy\n>> and they open source the internal to\nfull to show the full commit history of\nhow that was built when it was built who\nwas doing the PRs and all that\n>> it still doesn't explain yeah\nbecause I'm curious how you would feel\nabout this because the the response was\nalso Interesting.\nWell, I mean,\nI'm Is it Is it called Akams Akum's\nrazor? You know, don't attribute malice\nto what could be excused as, you know,\nincompetence.\nIs that is that the right phrase? um\nrazor is is more about like if if\nsomething if there's a simpler\nexplanation then that's the right\nexplanation but don't attribute malice\nto what could be attributed to like\nstupidity or or incompetence that's uh\nthat's some I don't know exactly what\n>> okay something else but um I I would\nprobably go on the more positive side of\nthings because because uh you know like\nwhen you're in a hurry and they're\nripping code from there I mean it could\nThis is even more the case with AI\nnowadays. Like it wouldn't be surprised\nme if you're writing some code with AI\nand it just steals some code from some\ncode base on GitHub and then and then\nyou're taking flak because like uh you\nhave a comment from another GitHub repo\nand I'll be like, \"Oh shit.\" It sounds\nlike they've fixed this issue, I'm\nguessing. So\nI I mean it's it's a mistake. It's a\nballs up, but I wouldn't uh I would move\non from it. That's my initial feeling.\n>> Right. The response was this is just\nanother product marketing, not really an\napology. Half of your apology talks\nabout the product or something like\nthat. Like I'm trying to find the\nthread. Yes. And you can guess who was\nputting those comments. The same people.\n>> So this is where we are. I mean, how\nlong ago was this? 26th of September.\n>> That was Saturday. Yeah. Okay. That's\nThis is hot hot hot\nsteaming gossip\ntea. I've been like I've been having a\nball this weekend, you know? I was\nliterally eating popcorn like what's\ngoing to happen next?\nWhoa, this happened. Like um I honestly\nlike my personal opinion.\nI mean, I don't really think it's fair\nthe the way that it's being um responded\nto. Maybe I'm biased because I really\nwant something like this to exist. And\num yeah, I know of course\nthe the main like post the main the main\ncomplaint of of the people complaining\nwas like, you know, trust in open source\nhas been eroded constantly. Projects are\nrelicensing. Um you know people are very\nreluctant to to adopt a project now and\nwe need to build trust and trust is\nearned by doing things right and\nstealing code and you know relicensing\nit because is a modilla public license\nand digger and therefore the open taco\ncode as well is actually Apache 2\nlicense so you can't rely it there's no\nattribution so there's like so many nos\nin this in this action like this\ncompletely destroys trust this is\nunacceptable So, so wait a minute.\n>> Uh, Vincent, their repo was open source\ntoo, right?\n>> No. So, they Well, yes, they they moved\nthe they moved the open taco into their\nmain repository. Um, which is a massive\nGolang monor repo. So, if you go to\ndigger. So, the actual\n>> where is the\n>> this is the open taco.\n>> So, this is where they stole the co the\ncode, right? that they\n>> this is the this is the internal one\nthat did they did some quick PC on the\ninternal code and then they copied all\nof that into their main digger\nrepository. So this is the open taco\nthat was private\n>> and then there's if uh there was it\nwasn't into their internal if you go\nback to their profile and you go to\ntheir main monor repo the main one\nthere. So there you have the license\nzone I guess\n>> which is Apache 2.\n>> Oh it's MIT.\n>> Oh it's better even.\nUm,\nokay. Well, thanks for the gossip. I\nthink I got a a taste of uh the what do\nyou call it? The digestion system of\nTerraform or something. You know, what's\ngoing around and what's going to come\nout. And\n>> I I I like some of the like first off, I\nthink the name is the name is very funny\nbecause you know, you have open tofu,\nyou have the concept of tacos and then\nopen taco kind of plays on that open to.\n>> So So who coined tacos then? What's the\n>> tacos is a known way of describing\nTerraform automation and collaboration\nsoftware? Tacos has been around for like\ntwo.\n>> So like if I search for like tacos\nsite hashp.com\ndo they\n>> sure\ndon't think they call it tacos but space\nlift zero and so on. If you search for\nlike terome automation, then you're\ngoing to find a lot of like websites\nthat refer to that as tacos,\n>> right? Taco provider like Spaceelift.\nYeah. So, they do have it on but it's on\nthe discussion. It's on their forum.\nIt's not\n>> interesting. Interesting.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well, anyway, that that was a really\ngood conversation. I think I I need to\num transition into work. Uh, I got stuff\nto\nto uh cards cards to move into different\nlanes and stuff like that.\n>> So, anyway, if anyone is watching this\nto this far, I congratulate you. Okay.\nAll the best, Vincent. Let's catch up.\n>> Some links if you want to add it in some\nlinks.\n>> Yeah, context is king. Context is king.\n>> Yeah, but it's more to discuss. We\ndefinitely have to do another session.\n>> Yeah, we definitely have to do another\nsession. Okay, great. See you, man.\n>> Okay. All right.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–4:08]\nThe following is a conversation with Vincent Smith on the latest developments around Terraform. Sorry, I I couldn't resist the Lex Friedman inspired introduction. Well, I know Vincent from uh Singapore. He's he's out there somewhere in Asia. He's a he's a thorough veteran of all things infrastructure, as am I. I'm based in the UK and an infrastructure engineer is my day job. What is an infrastructure engineer? I help run those software services that you use. I sort of help uh provision those cloud and manage and govern those cloud services usually AWS. And uh what one way to provision those resources is with a popular uh project called Terraform which fairly recently uh got bought by IBM and relicicensed uh under like a commercial license. So the thing that everyone uses the terraform is now uh in a sort of a interesting place and the conversation um that follows is Vince and I just chatting about it and hopefully you enjoy it. Please comment below and um I will uh try my best to answer all your questions. Thank you. >> So what's the tea? >> What's the tea? So you had some you had some juicy infrastructure gossip. >> Okay. So maybe some background like there's quite a few companies built around Terraform. Some of them being Space Lift, M0, you know, you know the whole deal with the the licensing change around Terraform and um a lot of companies forking the last uh Mozilla public licensed version of Terraform and then maintaining it as a fork under open tofu. Right. >> Right. And um aside from those companies, there's also Digger. I'm not sure how much Digger.dev is involved in this open TOFU effort. I'm not sure actually who are the founding companies behind Open Tofu. Um the the the term Taco Terapform automation TA collaboration CO and software. So Tacos, right? T A C O S Terafform automation collaboration software. >> Okay. Okay. >> Okay. So a lot of this Terapform automation and collaboration software examples are Teraphform Cloud where you push code into Git and then it triggers a a run of Terapform plan and apply. Um and and so Atlantis is a famous uh open source tacos. >> Yeah, I I just have Digger open right now and it looks like it just reminds me of Atlantis. >> Yeah, so Digger is an alternative to Atlantis with the premise being why do I need a separate EC2 instance when I hub a whole bunch of CI/CD runners. So what they do is they give you CI/CD workflows for um GitLab and GitHub actions and then they simply have an orchestration API that…\n\n[slide:2] [3:48–12:03]\nthen they mentioned like you know what's really missing and a big problem with Atlantis as well is the ability to just manage the orchestration. So Hashi Hashi conference happened last week where Hashikov is going to make a lot of announcements. So there was actually quite a lot of um things or news happening around Hashik um from other companies trying to you know use the event to also >> Wow, that must be such a cool event. Atlanta. Okay, cool. >> Okay. >> Yeah. >> Yep. >> So So last year on Hashicon they announced uh stack beta. I think the two years ago they announced uh terraform stacks private beta and then public beta and now it's finally ga general available. So what is terraform stacks? Steraphhone stacks is basically the the ability to define multiple terraform states in one stack. So that they for example a common scenario is you have a network and then you have a Kubernetes cluster and then you have some Argo CD deployment that needs to depend on that Kubernetes cluster right so you can those are all all individual components right the network has to exist and create all the subnets private and public subnets for the application nodes to be provisioned in. So the Kubernetes cluster can only be created after the network has been created. So Terapform STS will help you to orchestrate across multiple terapform states. >> So this is something that is cloud only, right? They will this is not part of the Terapform CLI until the most recent release where you can actually use the Terraform CLI to query the cloud stacks. But cloud stacks is cloud only except for some CLI to get some information about your stacks. But but wait a minute, Terraform must have had this feature before to depend on another stack for another I mean you could you can fish out values from another >> Yes, you can fish out values and I believe they just use workspaces and outputs between workspaces but they didn't have a crossworkspace orchestration uh um feature as far as I'm aware. >> What what does orchestration mean like like a like a like a >> this coordination >> like depends on on things like this? >> Yes. like I want to provision a new environment and that environment consists of a network, a cluster and a githops controller and the uh network needs to be created first then the cluster then the controller. Okay. >> So yeah >> so when you say orchestration I'm just like mapping it into GitHub workflows. Yeah. But okay carry on. when yeah when I say orchestration I mean…\n\n[slide:3] [11:43–19:59]\nbecause the deployment has a dependency implicit dependency on the gateway because you use the gateway ID uh the API gateway identity so when you you use that link terapform knows I need to create a gateway then I need to create the deployment but it does not have an explicit dependency between the deployment and for example an integration on the gateway so when when you don't do that then um you get a race condition. So it may manifest um sometimes it may not manifest right u but but the right way is to really say like okay this deployment also depends on these other resources you know and you have to explicitly say it depends on this gateway integration with this lambda and so on right >> yeah got it >> so that that becomes very um that works really well with terraform within a terraform state >> so terapform is amazing um in handling these resource dependencies sometimes you have to give it a little bit of a hint uh now from a higher level outside of the state. Um, creating dependencies between states adds a lot of like additional orchestration overhead that makes it difficult sometimes. Like one of the most common problem is I'm going to change my network for example and I'm going to change my output and now my subnets are no longer a map of key value pairs. Maybe they become an ordered list and then maybe I have another component which reads a key and then gets an error because there's no longer a map there. it's right I understand the complexity >> that happens um so why do people separate everything right why why do they create one state for the network one state for the cluster and that's often because of like life cycle um or ownership >> right >> yeah so a network usually has a much longer life cycle than the clusters within or even the deployments on on clusters >> I mean I usually say blast radius to to to clients like that's why we have so many goddamn stacks. >> Yes. Uh blast radius and um with that is also for example if you use and again this comes back to like a lot of discussions within the terraform space which is like do I always uh only apply after I merge. So um you know only apply off the master branch or do I like do I allow people to run apply from a from a branch and basically the branch is modifying the states which is shared between the master branch and then if somebody runs an apply then they may like inadvertently undo my changes because my merged yet right >> I see that all the time in my current client we have a channel…\n\n[slide:4] [19:38–27:54]\nyou might get when you when you're deploying infrastructure. I mean it it it doesn't really help you move fast. Um >> okay right so so so there's just I wanted to highlight that Atlantis is one solution. It lacks a lot of the orchestrations, gives you a lot of other stuff. Um, >> and it's open source and it's it's it's easy. You don't have to worry about >> can run it on $15 EC2 instance. You can go to the digger docs where they go into like pretty good arguments against it saying like, well, you know, it's never just one Atlantis instance. They have like a a doc where they compare the problems with Atlantis. I believe they say uh Atlantis is never Yeah. compared to Atlantis. I like their arguments. It's like it's never just one instance. Where is I can't see it now. But there was or maybe I I remember it from another um tacos. Uh >> but but since but since Atlas is just doesn't is is not like cloud pricing. I mean that's a huge win in my book. They don't even mention the price. I I talk to to friends of mine that are running, you know, 10 thousands of Terraform resources of, you know, very big scale and when they look at any RUM quotes, it's just like blows up their cloud bill because it's it goes from I'm I'm paying $20 a month from a, you know, a decent EC2 instance running Atlantis or running, you know, on a Kubernetes container. So, it's even less um, you know, CPU memory usage and I can, you know, so I'm not paying anything right now. I'm paying like 20 bucks max and I'm going to be facing $10,000 a month if I switch to like the cloud just because I want that like additional policy as code or I want additional orchestration features or arbback like that's not in Atlantis right you don't have proper arback you can do like some code owner setup with your GitHub PRs to you know only validate that if that person approves then it can be applied we do some conf test in my organization where we we do invalidate like or we block a PR if there's any changes to an IM policy so that the security has to come in and review these changes to IM policies for example. So we have some conf test like that >> some some routings going on. >> Yes and conf test is also um like hardcoded into Atlantis right you can Atlantis has their own workflows and the default workflows includes confest so it runs an OPA um policy against your um Terapform plan but if you don't want to use confest you can use other OPA or um other scanners. I I don't think I've even used comp like like…\n\n[slide:5] [27:34–35:49]\nfunny. My LinkedIn feed is like on one side Grunt Works you know advertising of kill the monolith uh kill the ter >> break >> breaking the ter workshops and they're like um you know terits are killing you. You must have responded like >> a monolithic terapform state. >> Well, no one ever does that but uh I don't see the problem there. companies like Grunt works they're like consultancy and they're going into a lot of places where people you know like in in-house develop their own terapform setup and then they face all kind of issues and basically teragrant is quite extreme because when you use teragrant you pretty much get one state per module so you build one module and then you invoke that module and that's one state you cannot like have multiple modules this is a bit crazy right I mean if you imagine how small modules sometimes are I can tell you in a previous place I worked at we like three years of terror grants and we had like 300 or 400 terraform states. It was insane. >> So, so, so I don't understand. So, if they do it in such a fragmented way, then how can they claim that that the monolithic terraform state is a problem? >> No, they're coming into organizations and they're saying, uh, we will help you break down your terror because all of your problems are because of the terith. >> That's crazy to me, but okay. >> Right. And they have they also launched a cloud product called Terra Terracale or Teragrant scale. So they they launched a product uh basically to migrate you into and then orchestrate. >> Oh okay. So it's like a importing blah blah blah >> right. Okay. So so that was just an anecdote because I'm seeing on one site um Terra team constantly posting about don't break down your ter is not your problem. The problem is the tooling. And on the other side I have like grunt work sponsor saying we have workshops to help you break down the term. Yeah, I'm definitely in camp um state graph. Definitely. >> Right. Yeah. So, so they hit hacker news uh front page the moment they posted this and um they Yeah. >> Nine point. Oh, yeah. >> That one. Yeah. Like 13 days ago. >> That's quite respectable, >> right? And then they also got like the mailing like they they said they have hundreds of organizations interested. They're looking for design partners to to help build out what people want from a state graph and what it looks like. They're even hiring Okamel developers, but they won't train you. I try I asked they said no, we don't have time to train…\n\n[slide:6] [35:28–40:15]\n[Music] Heat. Hey, Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] What happened next is they posted this on Reddit and and they posted on on on Hacker News. I think on Hackin News they had three uploads. I keep track of all the links and on Reddit there was an immediate uh you know very strong backlash from the community. Um there's a few Reddit accounts that were you know linked to organizations I me mentioned before >> and they were very critical. They were like why do you talk about an open standard like doesn't the standard involve communication and like contribution and a community like where is the discussion? where is the you know the RF the request for uh comments the RFC where is it you know the specification design um and why does it is it like declared as the open standard but is does it look like a product like there's a product road map even like how is this an open standard how can you declare to be the standard when you haven't like you know there's no community behind it right >> and I personally didn't really see that but like apparently that that resonated with a lot of people because that was pretty much like there weren't that many comments maybe 10 and like four out of them or maybe 50 50% I mean were like this is a product stop you know making it look like it's an open standard uh it's a product blah blah blah right so they open source the source code uh and one of the main things that's interesting is they completely integrate with the Terraform cloud uh back end so if you're familiar with Terraform as a back end you can use S3 you can use um Postgress you can use an HTTP remote backend or You can use Terapform cloud. So the Teraphform cloud back end is a very strict protocol that uses like authentication. So you use Terapform login when you run Terapform plan. You can even have it remote. >> So it uses the same back end. Interesting. >> And they implemented the Terapform cloud back end because it's like you know Terapform code is open source right source available. So people replicated all the API endpoints that Terapform uses and they implemented the back end of their own version. And that was like whoa cool. They use the whole Terraform back end. They have like SSO integration. quite small. So they >> and then yeah >> the creator of F or open terraform like cloud back end comes in and says >> okay guys I expect in this day and age you you know people…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This video is a conversational deep-dive into recent turbulence in the Terraform ecosystem: licensing shifts, forks, new orchestration products, and a very public community spat over an “open standard” play. The hosts map how teams currently run Terraform (single repos, many states, or cloud stacks), explain why multi-state orchestration is hard, and trace multiple vendor responses: Atlantis (open source), runner-based alternatives like Digger, managed vendors (Spacelift, M0), the Terraform Cloud “stacks” feature, and new projects pitching state-centric tooling (stategraph.dev and Digger’s “OpenTaco”). The conversation includes concrete operational trade-offs: why teams split states (ownership, lifecycle, blast radius), the risk of race conditions between resources (API Gateway example), how Atlantis’ PR lock + approved-plan workflow works, and why many orgs are wary of resource-under-management pricing versus self-hosted tooling. The hosts quote numbers and anecdotes from real clients: small self‑hosted ops can run on a ~$15 EC2 instance, many teams pay ~$20/month for simple setups, and some cloud quotes for managed “resource under management” tooling can balloon to ~$10,000/month for very large estates. The conversation highlights two recurring themes: *Context is king.* and the backlash topic that motivated the heated Reddit/Hacker News threads: *resource under management pricing is criminal.* The summary below follows the video’s slide timeline and gives a compact headline plus one-line summary per slide so you can judge whether to watch the clip.\n\n[slide:1]\n## Ecosystem context\nHosts set the stage: Terraform’s commercial relicensing led to forks (OpenTofu) and many vendors building “tacos” (Terraform Automation/Collaboration Software) such as Spacelift, M0, Atlantis, and Digger; Digger’s pitch is using existing CI runners instead of running a dedicated server.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Orchestration problem and stacks GA\nTerraform Cloud’s “stacks” (now GA) add cross‑state orchestration—helping sequence dependent states like network → cluster → GitOps controller—but this is cloud‑only and only partially surfaced to the CLI, so many orchestration gaps remain.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Dependency complexity and race conditions\nWithin a single state Terraform handles resource graphs well, but implicit dependencies across states create races (example: API Gateway deployment failing because an integration/lambda isn’t attached), and cross‑state outputs can change shapes, breaking dependents.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Atlantis vs runners vs pricing\nAtlantis provides PR locking, plan-on-PR and apply-from-approved-plan workflows and can run cheaply on a small EC2 ($15) or ~$20/month setups; managed vendors charge per‑resource which can scale from trivial to staggering ($10,000/month quoted for very large fleets).\n\n[slide:5]\n## Monolith vs many states debate\nTwo camps: tools that advocate splitting state for lifecycle/ownership reasons (TerraGrunt/Gruntwork approach) versus proposals to treat a large single state (“teralith”) with better tooling (state graph / monolith tooling); hosts favor state‑graph ideas for richer tooling.\n\n[slide:6]\n## OpenTaco launch and backlash\nDigger released “OpenTaco” (state manager, module registry, RBAC, dependency graph, insights) and a provocative video; the community pushed back on claims of an “open standard,” after the repo included copied Terraform Cloud backend code without attribution, triggering removal, heated Reddit/HN threads, and an apology post."
