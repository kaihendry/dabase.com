    "content": "Transcript:\nWell, good morning, Vincent.\n>> Good morning.\n>> It's been uh couple of weeks, hasn't it?\nOr [snorts] something.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. Could be at least 10 days, I\nthink.\n>> Yeah. I wanted to start by asking you a\ncouple of questions. Maybe\nan info um let I mean, we're both\ninfrastructure engineers, so I have an\ninfrastructure question for you.\n>> Okay. So this is a wonderful GitHub\naccount of this person here.\n>> I was just trying to\n>> so imagine there's like an AWS landscape\nlike this where where where the fruits\nhere are basically different teams,\nright?\n>> Yeah. So the so some teams have a dev\naccount, some some have a some have the\nwhole you know the whole shebang.\nUm and actually this is not even\naccurate like sometimes they can have\ndeployments in different regions right\ncould be U1\n>> I should have sorry this is not the best\nexample but you know I was I had to be\nquick about it. [snorts] Um so so each\nteam like potentially has\nhas a a number of deployments so we say\nright I think that's the the correct\nterminology because they could have a\ndeployment in USC East1 Singapore\nsame account\ndifferent environments and each\nenvironment is mapped to an account.\nYeah. So the my question is is that like\nI have a landscape like this in a in a\nbig company to manage and often enough\nI'm like you know does team Mango have\nstuff in this region and like I don't\nknow. Um but it's even worse. I mean if\nI had this uh up to date Jason JSON I\nprobably could easily quickly answer\nyeah okay they should have stuff in new\neast one\n>> but the trouble is that sometimes it's\nit's up to the different teams to deploy\ntheir own infrastructure so it's like\nthen again I don't even know if they've\nactually really done deployments you\nknow what I mean it's like so as a\nplatform engineer I have to like sort of\nkeep an eye on what people are doing but\nit's very difficult for me to keep it so\nI thought to myself this example is one\nI struggle with on a daily basis. Does\nTacos or your tool or I guess I mean\nTerraform Cloud will probably be the\ngreatest tool for this but like how do I\ntrack?\n>> Yeah. So with with the grid what I I do\nand I think other tools uh like Terra\nTeam or Digger or Spaceelift they also\nhave the concept of labels. So teams can\nattach labels to states and you can\ntrack if um if they are having states\nfor resources inside a certain region.\nNow the problem could be if you are\ndoing multi-reional\nterraform right if you could if you have\none state that creates um for example\nVPC peering between two regions and then\ncreates the end points on one side and\nthen does the\n>> that's a very good example that that\nthat's a kind of like special case I was\ngoing to talk about next\n>> but at the moment we've gone um yeah the\nstate file is separated per region yeah\n>> which makes sense and another thing\nbefore you start with\nuh in my previous organizations we also\nhad the first question we ask do we\norganize by team then by by by stage. So\nfor example in this case you have team\nApple has stages dev pro and u or do we\ngo by stage and then by team because um\ndo you first have like dev pro stage and\nthen within dev you have team A, team B,\nteam C and then within stage you have\nteam A. We had we had a I mean the\nprevious incarnation of of this cloud\ndeployment on the on this particular\nclient they had they had it whereby\nthere was like one dev account and all\nthe teams were on it\n>> but we the people were stepping on each\nother's toes all the time.\n>> It's not necessarily like with well the\nproblem we were facing is from a dev sec\nops perspective the rules that apply to\nnon-production uh stages are different\nfrom production. It's easier if you're\nin AWS or manager to basically define\nyour um what's it called like the units\nor the organizational units or use on\nthe stages level so that we could apply\nsecurity policies on the stages level.\nOh, you mean like stages as in these\nenvironments?\n>> Oh, use. Yeah, we have nested to use in\nin AWS or right. So, we decided that it\nwould make more sense because we are\nattaching our organization.\n>> I never thought about that. I never\nthought about that. That's a that's a\nbloody good idea actually. What? I've\nnever done that before now. So, yeah.\nSo, you have a tree.\nUh how do I share that with you? where\nwe had a discussion between the platform\nteam lead and the dev sec ops team and\nthen how do we set up our OUS and how do\nwe manage our security policies in our\nAWS and we had an existing setup where\nwe had like team A, team B, team C and\nthen we had dev staging and prod under\nthe teams and we switched it over to the\nother way because we wanted to manage\nour policies that way.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Um\ndid so did AWS support you? No, not\nreally.\n>> With AWS OUS, uh they can be like\nnested, right? And you can attach\npolicies to the OU. So you can attach\nthe non-prod policies to the nonpro OUS\nand then all of the teams operate within\nthose and then when you go to prod,\nthere's more guard rails and and\nsecurity.\n>> So yeah, I see what you're saying. So\nthe policies\napply on top level top level I'm not\nsure that's the right term stage.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then and then that trickles down.\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. Why\nhaven't I done that? I feel dumb for not\nhaving even done that.\n>> I mean because you came from an\nenvironment where they were sharing an\naccount and it was causing issues. But\nAWS is actually at some point I read\nthis book from uh like microservices\nfrom Sam Newman I think and he was like\nsaying in the book how AWS even goes so\nfar as to give every environment an\naccount. So that you know like team A\nprod has one AWS account and team B prod\nhas a separate AWS account. Uh actually\neven worse like team A has two services\nFU and bar and then team A FU stage goes\ninto one account and team uh A bar stage\ngoes into another account which is like\nso you need to do all of the peering and\nlike you know you can only connect uh or\ncommunicate across account boundaries\nwhich is crazy from like from a small\nstartup's perspective to to be to have\nto have all of this AWS account\nmanagement overhead right [snorts] um\nAnother thing is what we wanted was the\nability to\num\n[clears throat] vent an AWS account for\na team for a limited amount of time\n>> and then once they were done with it\nlike return it to a pool. So we wanted\non demand account creation.\n>> You return it to a pool then you just\ndestroy it.\n>> Well that's the thing. Originally AWS\ndidn't have a lot of AWS uh a lot of API\nfor account management. So destroying an\naccount was very difficult.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I see what you're saying.\n>> So, so the idea is to run\n>> I made a video about that.\n>> Yeah. So, the idea is is to run like\nnukes and and and basically have a pool\nof accounts and and cycle through them.\nUh which is a lot easier and there's a\nlot of tools to do that.\n>> Do you so you've used AWS Nuke? I think\nit changed.\n>> Uh there's two of them. I think I use\nthe other like there's one from Terra\nGrant which is very popular or um not\nTerra Grant but the Grunt Works nuke uh\nthat has been forked. I don't I don't\nthink I liked\n>> you.\n>> Yeah, I think the fork was better and\nthere's the grunt work one wasn't good.\nThere's a cl there's a cloud nuke uh\nthat supports multiploud. I I remember\ngoing through all of them and only one\nof them was really wellmaintained and\nand well structured.\n>> This is the one that is used in my\nemployer if I remember correctly.\nI have one in my repo as well like it's\nset up in lift and shift because I have\ntags which is like uh nuke don't destroy\nyou can put a tag so it's 100% not going\nto destroy some resources so I have\n>> ah I I have cloud nuke and I have AWS\nnuke which one am I using\n>> initial p was done with cloud nuke which\nwas a best practice from terror test for\ncleaning up but it was really bad and so\nthen I used reby AWS nuke which worked a\nlot\nUm, and then Ericson AWS Nuke. Yes. So\nChristristen AWS Nuke is a fork from the\noriginal Dby.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I'm I'm a big fan of uh nuking uh\naccounts or thermal environments. I made\na video about that again.\n>> Big fan.\n>> Yeah. So Okay. So what I'm Okay.\nOkay. You you told me about this uh\nstage level. Um\n>> Yeah. U organization. That's cool. I\ndidn't uh think about that for some\nreason or wasn't exposed to that. But\nbut still the question remains how how\ndo you how do I mean if I mean this is\ngoing to be duplicated on each stage. Um\nand then and then of course I mean let's\njust be a little bit explicit then then\nthen again this is going to be you know\nAP southeast one or something crazy\nu east one they're going to have\ndifferent resources in different regions\nUS uh EU west two or something and then\nand then just to make things even extra\nspicy I'm not too sure if it's worth is\nit worth putting it here yeah it is\nbecause things are split by region. Like\nfor example, they have a they use a\ndatabase vendor. I'm not going to tell\nthe name of the vendor, but the vendor\nitself has has this notion of uh\ndifferent sites. So you can have like a\nLondon site\nand uh I don't know an island site\nand things on their AP southeast.\n>> Yeah. So So um okay, let's just put over\nthere. So, so\nyeah, it doesn't make sense there. It\nshould be over there. I can't get over\nthere very easy. Well, let me just US\none or something. So what I'm trying to\nsay here is that like I I think\nhopefully you see the pain is like at\nthe moment like do we separate the state\nby you know this uh path\nor do we clump the state together even\nthough the database is actually designed\n>> uh potentially to be separate actually\n>> because it's like a backup\n>> and like I'm just like my head is\nturning like just tracking this is\nmaking my head spin. Never mind uh you\nknow uh\nthe other aspects of operating this plat\nthis platform.\nYeah. I mean I think the easy way\nforward always and this is why I think\ninfrastructure as code and really being\nable to to treat infrastructure as code\num it involves things like refactoring,\nright? So I think we should just go\nforward with merged like dry\n>> yagny you ain't going to need it type of\napproach merging everything.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then and then at the point that that\nit's like oh actually we're facing\nissues because of contention on the\nlocks state locks or whatever or because\nof um the terapform plan takes too long\nor whatever at that point there then\nrefactoring needs to be uh done. So of\ncourse we need to have like a road map\nand a target And it's such a pain. It's\nsuch a pain to refactor cuz we we have\nlike kind of like teams bothering us all\nthe time saying no you can't change this\nor like you know this is going to be\ndisruptive.\n>> Uh I mean uh I mean it's not that\ndisruptive but like just\n>> getting uh you know some of these\naccount uh some of these state files are\nso like high security that it's like a\npain just to move from one place to\nanother.\n>> Okay, I can understand that. But one\nthing right from experience running with\nTerraform a lot is that you must be able\nto rename things. So that's why I want\nto decouple my logical identities from\ntheir actual physical identities. But\nthen at the same time uh my original\nplan with with like the library that I\nwrote is that you don't get to determine\nyour identities right if you use Google\ncloud or other providers usually you\ncreate a resource you don't determine\nthe ID behind the scene it's determined\nfor you. So if you change a name or a\ndescription, it's not only recreated.\nUm, and that's good for a lot of\nscenarios, but it doesn't work like for\nS3 bucket or an RDS maybe, but even then\nfor an RDS, it shouldn't you shouldn't\nforce the identity on it because then\nwhen you need to move things, then it\nbecomes disruptive. But ideally moving a\nresource between two different states\nwhere it's being managed shouldn't be\ndisruptive. It should just be like I'm\nmoving. It's an interesting little thing\nthat you said there because like we have\na com we have a config YAML which we\nessentially give to each team because\neach team essentially manages I think\nwhat we call a data product\num they could have multiple data\nproducts but let's just say\nit's one to one even though it's not and\nin that config.yaml YAML\nwe there's a whole bunch of\nconfiguration as as we all know and like\nfor example\nuh feel free to disagree with this on\nbut like at at this point in time we\nactually allow them to set what the ids\nare and these ids are you know cascade\nand in in all sorts of weird and\nwonderful ways\n>> to name different resources and you know\nlike you know how like AWS likes dashes\nand then\n>> another thing likes underscores and\ndoesn't allow you to use those\ncharacters.\n>> Other things can't be longer than a 20\ncharacters or something crazy like that\nor whatever.\n>> But like at the at this point in time,\nwe actually allow team Mango like I mean\nyou know if Mango wanted to be a pair\nthe next day we allow that but it causes\nabsolutely mayhem honestly.\n>> Absolutely. Yeah. Uh so this is what I\nmean I come from an like accounting\nbackground right and accounting entries\nwhen you want to slice and dice and\nanalyze your data you use dimensions. So\nyou attach in in AWS parlins this is uh\ntags right labels and and and all of\nthis is mutable. So you can create\nreports that aggregate by certain keys\nand then um that's why a tagging policy\nis super important and and that's why\nalso the same with the like the um\nthe example here of like how do you\norganize your states? Do you organize\nthem by that and then by by team or vice\nversa? Those should all be labeling. Uh\n>> yeah, we we do tag we do tag quite\naggressively. But like but but does\ntagging really even help here? Like if\nif if some if team mango decided to\nbecome team pair or something,\n>> it shouldn't it it shouldn't be any\nproblem then, right? If if the team team\ntag is is really a tag and not tied into\nany resource identity, changing the\nidentity, sorry, changing the tag\ndoesn't affect the identity. So\neverything that depends on it is still\npointing the original identity.\n>> Oh, I think I see what you're saying. So\ninstead of instead of like focusing on\nchanging I don't know the C resource or\nthe stack name you change the the tag\nname.\n>> Yes. And then you can like always\nredefine or because I worked at everyone\nworked at organizations and business\ndevelopment teams or organ or the a like\nthe the sorry the the C level decides to\nreorganize and and and rename the teams\nmerge the teams and it causes a mayhem\non the infrastructure level because of\num logical\n>> not good advice. physical identity,\nsorry, physical identity should never be\num attached to u should never be\ndictated by by the the organization or\nthe the product name. Um and I think\nsome clouds don't allow you that, right?\nThe problem is a ter provider and AWS\nAPIs allows you to do that and they even\nhave like this pre uh\n>> this prefix like ID prefix thing. That's\nall.\n>> You're so right, Vincent. Jesus, I wish\nI was working with you. I'm learning a\nlot just just to get chatting with you\nevery hour.\n>> The problem that you're going to get\nweeks\n>> I tried to introduce this at a company\nand I got a massive um push back from\nengineers because they are used to use\nto do click ops in the AWS console and\nthey're like I can't find my resources.\nIt was cloud for stacks and the way the\ncloud form like um calculates the\nphysical ID name was very confusing\nbecause of the nested stack way of doing\nit that causes its own set of problems\nbecause then you lose resources just\nbecause you rename a stack now the\nresources logical identity no longer map\nand it just loses track of it. So they\nthey are adding more features to like\nmanage refactoring of resources which\nTerraform already does for you. Uh but\nthen the push back was from the\nengineers that are used to go into the\nAWS console and I can't find my specific\nradius instance or my specific load\nbalancer because the name is so and I'm\nlike you the problem is the dashboard if\nyou don't have a proper dashboard that\nshows you the tags and shows you to like\nslice and dice your resources by the\ntags\n>> to data dog's credit data dog actually\ndoes a good job of servicing all the\ntags\n>> and that's what it should be right\n>> console doesn't like I swear to god I\nwas dealing I can't remember what it was\nbut I was dealing with something the\nother day in in AWS and it didn't have\nbloody tags or it didn't show the tags.\n>> Yeah, tags are not everywhere in AWS. Um\nand and also not everywhere cuz there's\na convention a lot of resources if you\nput a tag with the key name it shows up\nin the UI as the actual resource name uh\nnicely like for example on EC2 instance\nyou cannot control the instance ID but\nyou put on a tag with a name and then\nthe dash the the the dash\n>> the web stores it nicely. Yeah,\n>> but some of them don't like the RDS\nbecause the RDS and the end point URL\nfor the RDS as well.\n>> These are teams because every team works\nindependently, right?\n>> Yeah. There should be like, you know, a\nbezos whatever mandate, make sure that\neverything's bloody tag or tagable.\n>> Yeah. So I think they're doing a lot of\nwork there with like the resource\nmanager uh that the t you have now the\nability to like review all of your\nresources across your across your AWS\norc uh using the resource manager and\nthen using tags. So there are separate\nservices focused just on that on like\nmanaging resources and finding your\nresources.\n>> Cool. Cool. Okay. So\n>> I really like your tips here, but but\nstill the question remains given a\nplatform like this with lots of uh teams\nand things like this. I is is the is the\ngrid the right tool to make to to keep\nan eye on all all this stuff or what\nwould you suggest?\nBecause I need to know what's going on\nhere sometimes. Otherwise,\n>> when people ask me, \"Has Gene Mango got\nthe thing in London?\" I'll be like, \"Um,\n>> I think you should research to system.\"\nI can't speak. I think you should re\nreach out to system initiative because\nhe's often posting about like um they\nhave a programmable graph that [snorts]\nallows people to manage their\n>> system initiative. I\n>> so Adam and uh his colleagues uh demoed\nit to to to us\n>> works.\n>> Yeah. And uh to be honest, I I was a\ncomplete [ __ ] but you know, you got\nto give me credit because I\n>> as usual. [laughter]\n>> So, so he Yeah. So, system initiative,\nthey demoed this like, you know, like\nthis big square. I don't know why that's\nlike that.\n>> And then you have your your VPCs and\nthings like this. Like, first off, I was\nlike, ah man,\n>> I hate it when you you start\ninfrastructure from a networking\nperspective, but I get it. But I I hate\nit like\nlike you know like if you want Yeah. VPC\nthis VPC that\nbecause I just I just hate it. I hate\nlike a a focus on you know network based\ninfrastructure. I prefer to think of\nthings as I don't know like this level\nand then and then it goes on like\nwhatever to um eventually you know EC2\nand things like this. Um but then the\nthing that really got me was like okay\nso you you're creating resources la\n>> and then I was like how do you like\nmaintain the state and all that stuff?\nHe says oh this is just this is what it\nis right now.\n>> It was like a onetoone mapping and then\nI go like oh so how do you do that? How\ndo you like connect to the terraform\nprovider? He says oh we just run AWS CLI\nCLI commands under the\n>> Yeah. Yeah. And I was like\n>> this is crazy. No, no, this cannot work.\n>> I I initially wanted to contribution\nof this year at the beginning of the\nyear was to like find an open source\nproject and contribute to it. And I was\nlike, okay, SI is it. I'm going to look\ninto it. And the moment they showed me\nlike linked me to the TypeScript under\nthe hood, which is literally just\ncalling the AWS CLI, I was like, there's\nso much autogenerated APIs like the\ntelephone provider autogenerated. Um why\nwould you like go down to just scripting\naround the CLI like literally TypeScript\nTypeScript OSX um the thing is that's I\nthink is an implementation detail\nbecause the idea of every\num component there being uh it's a a\nprogrammable graph right the point is\nthat there are simple um imperative type\nof scripts I think it works better for\npeople that are used to simple that are\nlike like to write uh a script in YAML.\nUm basically every arrow, every\ncomponent has like um their own create,\nread, update hooks and those invoke the\nscripts and they build a whole bunch of\ncomponents with all of their CRUD hooks.\nFor example, a VPC that has the create\nhook, the read hook, the update hook\nthat directly maps to the AWS CLI\ncommands. And that's basically SI built\nthe graph with the hooks that are\ninvocable like functions. And then they\nbuilt the whole bunch of like components\nthat are using that graph. So then when\nthey create the VPC, it goes and runs\nthat AWS CLI command, that AWS CLI\ncommand when you want to update it. And\nI mean I I think it comes back to the\nthe question like why doesn't Terraform\ndo that also, right? Because Terapform\nis just talking to the AWS API. It could\njust go and find all of the resources\nthat supposedly exists based on tags\nbecause that's what um Hashimoto\noriginally did for Terraform. uh they\nwere just creating resources and using\ntags on the resources to find them.\n>> It's funny you mentioned it. I was\nrandomly watching a video and he talks\nabout Terraform as a graph API and like\nwell okay but where's your\nrepresentation of the graph?\nSo, so there's this interesting\nTerraform issue where uh they ask\nHashimoto like why didn't you just um\nyou know attack like why do you need\nstate like get rid of the state file and\nhe highlighted all of the issues that\nyou get if you don't have a state file\nif you don't um I think one of them was\nspeed um there was others because the\nphysical identity changes if the tag\nchanges um so they tried it and they\nsaid and it didn't really work so um\nbasically you're saying that Hashimoto\ndid try something what system initiative\ndid but it was just not going to work\n>> a long time ago right and I think things\nchanged a lot so I don't know um I think\nthere's some interesting ideas uh but I\nhad the same reaction when I looked at\nthe system initiative when I really\nlifted up the the whole\n>> feel for dismissing the whole idea\nbecause I just thought like it wasn't\ngoing to work just instinctively but but\nnow yeah now I mean I started this\nconversation saying that I need I need\nto see a visualization and then we just\ngo back to system initiative.\n[snorts] Uh yeah, I mean I guess they\nthey could convince us in the end. I\nthink this is one of the main what I\nlearned from building my library is that\nthe framework in itself maybe is\napproaching the problem from a certain\nway but the actual utility comes from\nthe library of components that comes\nwith it because like you can interact\nwith the cloud however you want like you\nwant to use a state file or you want to\nuse a kubernetes operator or you want to\nbuild pulley um you know typescript to\nevery possible language sure go ahead do\nall of that the problem is if you cannot\ngive me a nice library of components. If\nyou like when I looked at crossplane,\nthere was no proper um you know\navailable publicly available set of\ncrossplane um resources that I could use\nwith AWS. I would need to build\neverything out of the box. Uh and the\nonly framework that really has this is\nAWS CDK, right? Because it comes out of\nthe box not just with the low-level AWS\nAPI interface but also with the\nintegration patterns of how you use\nthese services together. And then the\nother framework that does that is SSI\nwhich is uh sorry SST not SSI what the\nhell uh SST which is basically using\nPalumi those basic components and then\nbuilding highle system integration\npatterns on top of it\n>> just to service integration\n>> just to repeat what my understanding\nwhat you just said you just like you got\nto use the tool that has the best\ncoverage of the of the resources that\nyou're trying to use.\n>> Yeah. And the services uh the\nintegrations have um integration\npatterns between services because if you\nuse AWS you must know every single\nservice integrated with IM kind of\npractical look at it.\n>> Yeah and and and this is what what\nsystem initiative I think spent 5 years\ndoing they started they had to spend\nafter they have the basic framework they\nhave to spend all this time to building\nall of the components for AWS writing\nevery single AWS CLI script for every\nsingle hook that a component um needs to\nyou know invoke whenever couldn't have\ngone down that path of uh what did you\nshow me that was autogenerated? Oh my I\nforgot the name of it.\n>> There there is AWSC uh like cloud\ncontrol provider that's autogenerated\nfrom the AWS API but again on its own\nthat doesn't really help because\ncreating a single API resource does not\ngive you the functionality that you need\nout of the AWS API because the AWS API\neffectively is a combination of many\nresources working together in a certain\nconfigured way. But the but system\ninitiative since they since they\nrely on AWS CLI the AWS CLI surely is\ntheir interface and that's there.\n>> Sure. But the AWS CL CLI is also just\nautogenerated wrapper around most of the\nAWS APIs, right? It doesn't give you\nlike the idea of AWS CDK. The example\nthat I like to give is I have an EC2\ninstance and I want it to give it\npermission to an IM uh to an S3 bucket.\nI want I have an EC2 instance and I want\nto give it access to an S3 bucket.\nRight? So now look at how many resources\nyou need to create. Right?\n>> Maybe you say, \"Oh, but that's a very\ncommon pattern in my organization. So I\ncreate a terapform module that combines\nthe two and then later down the line you\nhave a situation where the S3 bucket\nactually needs to trigger a lambda\nwhenever the the S3 instance does\nsomething or whatever or needs to be\nhooked up to an SNS and you keep\nextending that original very simple\nbasic pattern until it becomes a massive\nlike module with you know 40 different\nparameters to configure whatever use\ncases you now have after two years of of\nusing AWS and evolving your product. Um\nI think the right way is what what they\nare doing with AWS CDK is the actual\nservice teams and the community building\nproper um patterns around these things\nsuch as you know with abstractions such\nas I have an I principle I have an uh\nresource and I can grant a principle\naccess to a resource and if the I\nprinciple is an AWS instance and it\nneeds to implement this this this\ninterface that means it must have an IM\nrole that I can refer to. So who can\nbuild up under the\n>> hood idea of encapsulated u I guess my\nfavorite one in AWS is the the\nserverless SAM stuff.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Here's an example that got my head\nspinning the other day. Um\nso a colleague was telling me that when\nyou use ECS it creates like a bucket\nbehind the scenes. And the trouble is in\nour in in the organization that I'm what\nI'm working with, they're so strict\nabout all their their bucket policies\nand things like that. Like for example,\nI think you have to have a bucket policy\nwith some deny on it or something like\nthat. Like just off the bat when you\ncreate a but the trouble is that ECS\ncreates a bucket and it doesn't it\nrelies on that bucket not having the\npolicy for it to work. So, so basically\nthis colleague of mine was telling me\nthat they were using ECS and it wasn't\nworking and they couldn't figure out\nwhat the hell the problem [laughter] was\nbecause like if you look around ECS\ndocumentation, you won't you won't see\nthat you know ECS requires this bucket\nto work.\n>> It's kind of hidden away.\n>> Yeah. And then so so basically that's to\nshow I mean that's that's me trying to\ngive come up with a dumb counter example\nto these abstractions because then you\njust don't know what the hell's going on\nsometimes.\n>> Um especially if they use\n>> so here the extraction is the user\ninterface that AWS creates and when you\ncreate the button under the hood it\ncalls many different APIs to create the\nbucket and whatever. And when you then\nneed to capture that into infrastructure\nas code now suddenly you have to go and\nfigure out bucket policy get cascades\ndown into that bucket you're screwed.\nYou know what I mean?\n>> Okay. Yeah. What you're saying is\n>> a stupid example. It shouldn't really\nhappen, but it it happened.\n>> No, but like these things happen all the\ntime. Like I am I'm very annoyed when\npeople click ops things into a\nnon-production envir uh sorry into a\nproduction environment because there's a\ntime limit. There's a time constraint\nand they didn't have time to do to do\nthe ISC. they clicked it in on in dev\nthen they clicked it in in staging and\nnow there's a deadline and they need to\ndo it um because the IC doesn't work for\nexample\n>> when you when you click something in\n>> it will maybe enable a service uh uh\nlinked role into the AWS account\nautomatically so like you you start\nusing an AWS service if you use user\n>> interface it does a lot of things and\nyou don't even know what it is it's so\nhard to capture\n>> and that's what I like about AWS CDK\nbecause it actually capt captures all of\nthose actions. It's like a user\ninterface but a programmatic one. So\nit's built to cap like it's almost the\nsame. I mean honestly when you use AWS\nCDK and you have a bucket and you have a\nlambda and you need to connect it to\nunder the hood it's going to make sure\nthat there's a resource policy that\nthere's an IM lambda permission whatever\nif the bucket needs\n>> are you confident that like the the the\nAWS console and the CDK are are\nsynologist or onetoone because I'm I'm\nalways a bit doubtful that they are\n>> very doubtful\n>> I am very confident that\n>> 90% of the time they are because I\nbelieve AWS uses CDK internally as well\nto build their products. I believe that\nthe teams that build the API interfaces\nof those services actually contribute to\nAWS CDK to capture these things.\n>> And\n>> so did you say 80% because like yeah\nthat's a lot better than say Terraform\nwhere I'm probably like 10% you know.\n>> Oh absolutely. Terraform is a nightmare.\nUm and and and having an autogenerated\nTerraform provider is not going to solve\nthe problem again because the the\nlow-level API resources are not the\nsolution. It's a combination of them.\nAnd and then the comment I get a lot on\nReddit is like, \"Yeah, but if you're\nusing a programming language to do\ninfrastructure, you're doing it wrong.\"\nAnd the reality is again\nthe the the cloud is not as basic as it\nused to be. It's not just about creating\nnetwork subnets and and EC2 instances\nand allocating network interfaces. uh\nand that used to be probably quite\nsimple but now you have like IBV6 then\nyou have like your flow logs then you\nhave uh a flow log bucket and then you\nhave all kinds of uh integration\npatterns across different services and I\nmean case in point\n>> so sorry can you just rephrase that like\nwho said like if you if you're using\ninfrastructure you're doing it wrong\nwhat\n>> no if you're using programming languages\nlike full\n>> oh right\n>> like full uh what's it called to\nincomplete programming languages to to\nwrite infrastructure as code you're\ndoing it That's a very common um\nargument against using general purpose\nprogramming language. The the most\ncommon argument is um we just need a\nconfig file. We just need to do a\ndeclarative and we need to keep it\nsimple and it will be fine.\n>> Y yeah\nto be honest I'm usually in that camp\nbut uh but it bites all the time.\n>> Well you you can be in that camp until\nyou do something actual real work and\nthen you realize that that that's a very\nnaive approach. And then every time I I\nI I come with that argument, people say,\n\"Oh, I worked at like hundred different\ncountry large organization and we have\nno problem.\" I don't believe it. I don't\nbelieve you have a problem or I don't\nbelieve you work at such an\norganization. If you think that it's so\nsimple to just use terapform\nconfiguration.\n>> Yeah, I'm just trying to capture what\nwe're saying in a nice graphic\nin a nice slide. Uh\n>> so there's this these efforts from the\ncommunity to use basic terapform modules\nto capture all of these usage patterns\nand very quickly those modules become\njust I mean what I was going to say\n>> one\n>> yeah what what I was going to say is\ncase in point um the argument that the\nterraform sorry the argument that the\ncloud is simple and we just need to use\nbasic declarative configuration just go\nlook at the of the VPC module just go\nlook at the VPC module look at how many\num variables there are input variables\nbecause you can do um IMAP uh sorry\nwhat's it called when you have IP\nmanager um IP man no the the basically\nmanaged IP EPOM yeah IP uh yeah that\nsounds right so you can do you can set\nup a cider to control the you know cider\nsubet allocations\num you can do your flow locks you can so\nthe amount of of of things that you can\ndo is so big that if you look at that\nmodule\n>> uh alone you will notice that there's\nlike you know I don't know so many\ndifferent Torah form configuration files\neach one has a locals block that has\nmultiple indirection layers on top of\nthe uh putting Julio variable that needs\nto be set to true before the whole\nmodule can be used u but then you have\nso much in there that\nyou know you can't tell me that you just\nneed a very basic and then and then the\num the response is usually oh no problem\nI just take that beautiful module that\nhas all of these things because people\ncontribute epam I need IPv6 support. I\nneed net instance support because I\ndon't want to pay through my nose for\nnet instances. Uh sorry, I don't want to\npay for net gateways. I just want to\nspin up an instance and and save 20% um\nsorry and save 80% of the cost of of\nnet. Um so I need all of these features.\nSo I just take that module, I remove\nwhat I don't want and I keep it simple.\nBut then you have to maintain your own\nversion of that module. And as things\nare being introduced, you need to like\nmerge upstream down into your stuff. And\nbasically everyone is just forking um\nshared resources and then keeping their\nown private copy of it and then how many\npeople actually contribute back to it.\nYeah,\n>> I think that's that's just a\n>> in my current client we have so many\ndifferent constructs and uh\n>> they're using AWS CDK, right? and they\nare trying\n>> well we're mix now we're using a mix\nbetween CDK and ter but historically\nthey were using CDK\n>> yeah it works but yeah it's but but we\nhave that problem as you describe so\nthere's nothing that to help me\nvisualize this Vincent [ __ ]\n>> well does\n>> you have access to the grid\n>> um but\nuh\n>> so what the grid does is right now I\nmean the grid But can the grid can can\nthe grid I remember the grid taking in\nterraform state but can it can can it\nalso take in CDK state because this is a\nmix between CDK and Terraform right now.\nThis is this is another thing that makes\nmy life extra exciting.\nUh um right now the grid\n>> new requirements new requirements.\n>> So the grid is you can look at the grid\nas like two two way you have one is the\ncontrol plane and two is a data plane.\nThe control plane is the is the way of\ncreating states and metadata around the\nstates such as the labels such as the\nteam or the the stage or the\n>> why do you why do you say labels is just\nlabels and\n>> tax is a very AWS specific terminology\n>> okay carry on\n>> labels is closer to K cubernetes way of\ndoing things like in in Kubernetes you\nhave labels and annotations I just um\nhave the key value pair\n>> what's annotation again then\n>> annotations you can apply to resources\nthen I think there's two different um\nprogrammatic parts. One of them is meant\nto be like the label queries are meant\nto be much faster to query across the\nstate and the annotation is less\nqueryable. I think that's why they\nseparate the two.\n>> Wow. An annotation is um\n>> some information that you can like the\nannotations you were using for like on\nan ingress manifest. You may have an\nannotation that the controller is\nenginex ingress for example and another\ningress manifest might be controlled by\nanother um um ingress controller. So\nthat goes into annotations but the\nlabels is like um you want to do label\nqueries against the resources to find\nthem. I know that when it when they were\nasked about like in Kubernetes why do\nyou separate labels and annotations and\nthe response was one is much more f like\nperforms much better to query.\n>> Yeah because you know everything in\nKubernetes is uses label queries to to\nselect resources. Right.\n>> Right.\n>> So you don't you don't have Okay. So\nthere's no CDK. Okay. There's there's\nnothing that that will help.\n>> No. Right. Now the the grid is purely\nfor Terraform state. The problem with\nCDK is it's cloud form, right? Cloud\nform manages the stacks.\n>> Couldn't you add a source for cloud for\n>> I think I think if you look at spacelift\nor um mass driver, they may they support\nboth. I think the way that you describe\nyour um your your your your employer's\num what do you call it infrastructure is\nthat you you had you had CDK and then\nyou and then and then you oh and then\nyou get it and then you and then you\nconverted to to Terraform. Oh [ __ ] You\ndon't use you don't use ter you don't\nuse CDK at all do you? [ __ ] I now\nremember your your setup.\n>> You translate everything.\n>> I worked at different companies.\n>> Okay. Okay. So everything's terraform\nbasically.\n>> I'll tell you that my my issue was um\nbefore we have cloud formation on one\nteam and terraform on another team and\nas a platform team for example we like\nto create our landing zone using\nterraform. So we have our networks or\nclusters that maybe we have a shared\nKubernetes cluster that both teams need\nto land into. That's your landing zone.\nSo what we need to be able to do is\nexpose those integration points, right?\nSo team B needs to be able to read\nwhere's my cluster ID and how do I or\nhow do I hook up my product repository\nso that the Argo CD deployments going\ninto the right cluster.\n>> So you do that so sorry if I I didn't\nquite catch the beginning. So you do\nthat in terraform the the landing zone.\nSo what I'm I I'm just giving you a\ncontext of like different teams use\nusing different technologies and the\nproblem I had was I tried to create an\nintegration registry and we talked about\nthis because he says at um at your\norganization they use a massive JSON\nfile that keeps track of the integration\npoints between different um components.\nSo everything registers just writes\ninformation out to a JSON file. And I\ndid similar things like I had AWS CDK\nwrite to SSM parameter store and I had\nTerafform read from SSM parameter store\nand I had terapform right to SSM\nparameter store and AWS CDK reading from\nparameter store.\n>> Yeah. I prefer the central as I mean\nthis this in reality has lots of other\nfields. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So so the problem with with using\na JSON file you're restricted to a um\nusually a a git repository, right?\neither you go to a massive monor repo or\nuh you do a subm module across all of\nthe repository so that they have that\nJSON file or I don't know how you're\ngoing to get the file in there and\nversion control it\n>> I I kind of re I shouldn't say this on\nonline but I kind of rewrote something\nthat we used at work I I mean I didn't\nuh steal the code I absolutely wrote it\nfrom scratch using\nuh using um\nI guess a bit of claude magic So, so\nessentially what happens is that we have\nan act a reusable action which which\njust feeds in the account group or the\nthe team name\n>> and the environment and then out pops\nuh\nuh things like oh sorry this is me using\nthe action um\nsorry the other repo actually had the\nimplementation\nthere's there's an action that basically\njust out uh looks up the style the stuff\nin the actions JSON.\nIt's it's nice and fast. It doesn't do\nlike a full checkout or something weird.\nAnd uh and then just sets the extra\ninformation that that that the um that\nthe Terraform or whatever your\ninfrastructure needs like the account,\nthe region, a key for this, a key for\nthat.\n>> Yeah. The problem there is like you're\nyou're using a registry and then you\ndon't know like how stale is that value\nand who is consuming the value. That was\nmy problem. Um [snorts]\n>> well I mean if it's centralized the\nsource of truth is pretty sweet. I mean\n>> sure but if it changes how do you\ntrickle down that change or identify who\nneeds to be updated? Yeah, this is this\nis why I'm going back to this all the\ntime because I need to know\n>> what [snorts] how fresh they are here.\n>> Yeah, never mind what's where. I need to\nknow what version they're running.\n>> Um\n>> or what version they have viewed or\nconsumed.\n>> Yeah. Like we we in our repos we tag the\nthis for example and then we kind of\nallow them to\ntag their deployments or what do you\ncall it you know use a branch or\nwhatever to to pin sorry pin was the\nword I was looking for but then yeah\nthey've pinned you know version one here\nand like now we're on version five like\nhow do\n>> exactly so so this is also something I\nlearned about um this version pinning\nscenario is that if you start to deal\nwith these type of deeply nested\nstructures where you have 40 different\nstates.\n>> Just hold that thought. I got to reply\nto my wife.\nSo the kids need need to go to school. I\nthink my wife will take them. So yeah.\nYeah. Hold the thought resume.\n>> Yeah. So what we were saying is that\nversion pinning is important,\n>> right? and and when you start I started\nmy career around DevOps with Kubernetes.\nSo I learned very early that immutable\ninfrastructure your docker image needs\nto be hard you know hard pinned so that\nyou can do rolling updates because\nKubernetes doesn't allow you to use a\nmutable um label. So version pinning is\nvery important. You want to pin your\ndocker image. Kubernetes doesn't allow\nlike uh at latest or whatever the docker\n>> condition or officially the way that\nKubernetes is designed is to use\nimmutable tags and then the way that it\ndetects that that um a deployment needs\nto be rolled is when you change\nsomething right you change the tag and\nso it spins up a separate replica\ncontroller starts\n>> I didn't realize it enforced it yeah I\nknow best practice is to use a is to use\n>> yeah and there's a lot of workarounds\nlike keep or ke sorry to basically um\ntrack um you know a docker hub image\nrepository and identify if a new um\nmetadata if a new checksum has been\npushed for a certain latest tag and then\nautomatically trigger a rolling update\nbut then you have to work around it by\nby changing the labels and then it will\nstart rolling out pods with new labels\nthose are all workarounds the original\ndesign of Kubernetes is very simple your\nimage tag is what determines the version\nthat runs so you cannot use a mutable\ntag. You have to specify which version\nyou want to run and if you want to\nupdate it, you change Kubernetes\nmanifests. What what helps you update\nthem? Sorry. Like how do you what's the\nworkflow for people like do they get\nlike a dependabot like oh you need to to\nbump.\n>> Yeah. So we're we're going back to the\npoint that the design when you start\nwith Kubernetes and Docker and immutable\ninfrastructure is that version pinning\nis very important, right? And and as you\njust highlighted also when you get a lot\nof different states and a new version\nhas been published but um you have all\nof these um you know very niche um\nlittle states that haven't been touched\nfor a long time and they're still on\nversion one right and now you and then\nfor example you have a big um\norganizationwide initiative that you\nneed to upgrade the provider and then\nyou find out that some really deep uh\nnested areas are still using a very old\nversion and now they suddenly have to go\nall the way to production and they're\nlike\nthe answer. I [laughter] need to know\nthe answer. How you keep\n>> So, so funny funny enough. Funny enough,\nuh, one of my previous colleagues, he\njust got rid of all of the versioning.\nHe trunk based just\n>> Well, this is this is what I like to do\nin a in a sense. Just tell everyone you\ngot to use latest.\n>> See you.\n>> Yeah. Latest or at stable or something\nor there's probably some other type,\n>> right? And but if you're in a monor repo\nand and you're you're running off git,\nyou just point to head, right? So so\nwhen you run your IC for example and it\nchecks out the repository and it it gets\nhead and so it gets all the latest\nversion of your modules together with\nhead of your um because like imagine\nthat you have a infrastructure mono and\nyou have a GitHub action or Atlantis\nrunning to to do your IC terapform plan\napply. So the first thing it does on\nyour branch or of master it will check\nout the repo and it will take head right\nand then instead of version pinning\nevery single module which is the\nrecommended right way to do instead of\nversion pinning any every module you\npoint everything relatively within the\nrepo to your current like head.\n>> Got it.\n>> Right. Which is trunk based development.\nRight.\n>> Right. And at that point that means\nevery single change you make to a module\nautomatically gets procreated across\nyour whole infrastructure.\n>> Yeah, that means but that means you have\nto deploy in a in a with some rigor some\nschedule, right?\n>> No, you you have to use feature flags\nand you have to release features like\nfor example if you're going to so this\nis what we do at my organization right\nnow. We we have gotten rid of all the\nmodules.\nSo trunk based trunkbased infrastructure\nwith feature facts.\n>> Absolutely.\nI did a a presentation about that other\nconference.\n>> This is something that Thoughtworks\npreaches for software development, but\nfor some reason I never thought about\nthis in the context of infrastructure.\n>> Yeah. So it's it's it's the same thing.\nThe first thing you have to do is you\npoint all of you get rid of all the\nmodule versions. you point to the\nrelative path or you make sure that\nyou're always checking out the latest\nversion of the modules, right? And then\nwhen you run your Terraform plan, of\ncourse, you have to control how those\nfeatures get rolled out, right? So the\nbest way to control how features get\nrolled out across your infrastructure is\nby putting in feature flags, right?\n>> So we're adding a new, for example,\nwe're adding a new we're doing a\ndatabase migration. I'm changing my\nmodule to to provision the new database\nas well as keep the old database\ninstance running and it's behind a\nfeature flag. So when this gets applied\ninto dev, it's going to spin up a new\ndatabase. It's still going to have the\nold database there and we're going to\nstart pointing our customers um to the\nnew one, our client to the new one. If\nwe're doing this with a cut over, uh we\nobviously need\n>> How do you do this with Terraform? But\ncarry on.\n[clears throat]\n>> It's very simple on your module. You\njust put a variable that that um sets\nmigration enabled true and in production\nis disabled and then you have another\nvariable that says uh delete the old\ndatabase and then you you you toggle the\nthe flags as you are getting confident\nyou have the same code running in depth\nyou have tested it then you're going\ninto staging you've tested the cut over\neverything then you ready go to prod\nyou're doing the first flag on the new\ndatabase gets created you re reconfigure\nyour clients you turn on the second flag\nthe old database gets deleted your cut\nover is done and then you go back to\nyour module, you delete folds variables\nand across your real estate everything\nis replanned with the latest version of\nthat module and it works because you've\ntested it everywhere, right? Your your\nmodule is immediately planned everywhere\nand it shouldn't show you any diff when\nyou remove them. So, it's feature flag\ndevelopment, you know, with u\n>> I've never heard of this in all honesty.\nI thought I've never seen\n>> I do that with Atlantis only. Um um at\n>> does Atlantis have some some sort of\nsupport for feature flags.\n>> No, but I basically just do an enable\nauto plan and I automatically I have\nAtlantis project detection integrated\nwithin my repo bootstrapper. So when I\nset up my repository, it automatically\ngenerates the configuration for every\nsingle directory for Atlantis to figure\nout whenever this module changes, you\nneed to replan all of the states that\ndepend on that module. And so whenever\nanyone makes a change to a module, it's\nimmediately tested everywhere. Like if\nit's going to have an impact on pro,\nthat PR is immediately blocked because\nyou haven't put in a feature flag on the\nvariable. So you need to set up a\nvariable to make sure that it's by\ndefault acting like originally and then\nyou go and update the call sites where\nyou want this feature to be deployed and\nthen you set now enable it here and then\nyou test it in dev. It's okay. Then we\ncan go um and and and push this module.\nWe can get the PR merged because then we\ndo multiple PRs to roll it across our\nenvironments and that way we don't have\nlike some really old state using a\nreally old module. We always have\neverything on head.\n>> That's the goal.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, I like that a lot. Wow.\n>> Wow.\n>> And so\n>> the requirement is to have the\ncapability to define what is the\ndependency or which modules a state\ndepends on. Is it if you don't do that\nright, you're back to your original\nsituation where everything is version\npint and then now you could discover\nthat one particular team is still using\nversion 1.0 and if you're doing sambar,\nright, you're on version 2.0 means that\nyou have a breaking change, right? So\nthey have to\ndon't I mean or\n>> or uses it as an excuse to break an API\nwhich is\n>> yeah but I'm I'm so I'm doing that\nturnbased development on my IC with\nfeature flex but I am still every single\ntime doing sar on my modules because I'm\nsnapshotting the module version in case\nanything happens I can always pin it so\nthis is something that happens sometimes\nis this module this change is\nsignificant and it's we can't just put\nit behind a feature flag because that's\nthe the the the flip side of feature\nflags, right? You cannot control the\ninteraction of the flags if you have so\nmany flags on them. So, at some point um\nthe risk is that maybe one team is\nadding a variable for their use case and\nother teams another variable and how do\nthose interact with each other? You\ndon't know how they interact with each\nother. So, it's nice to say like, oh, we\nknow all of the possible configurations\nof the feature flags together. We know\nthat it's going to work. we don't if we\ndon't clean up feature frags and if we\nif we are not careful we we have other\ncomplexities to deal with. Um\n>> yeah so it's not it's not there's no\nsilver bullet of course I think I know\nwhat you mean there like [laughter]\nclean yeah like then you have you know\nnew problem uh\n>> so so every single module change comes\nwith a server like change log and an\nactual snapshot of that module pushed\ninto an S3 bucket. So if we need for\nwhatever reason we can pin a module but\nit's highly discouraged if you do like\n>> if you do go ahead and pin it then I set\nup um a scheduled action that that\ndetects any states that have a pinned\nmodule and then it goes and uh tries to\nunpin it and creates a PR to unpin it\nand then the idea is that we need to get\nthose PRs merged as soon as possible to\nbasically unpin the modules otherwise\nthese particular states will start to\nback behind and become more of a\nheadache and lead you down yak shaving\npaths down the line. Right. [snorts] Um,\n>> cool, man. Thanks. Thanks for all that\nwisdom, man.\n>> But that all works if you're in a monor\nrepo, right? Um\n>> and and and and then the other\nalternative actually to just this week\nconfig hub it was announced like last\nweek but this week they they did an IT\nnext article where they go into details\nabout the problem of YAML manifest and\nArgo CD. They're basically highlighting\nhow a lot of people are abusing Argo CCD\nuh with Helm to you know in memory on\nthe Kubernetes cluster um expand all of\nthe YAML manifests and then fire it off\nat the Kubernetes cluster and then they\nhave no idea what's happening. Um so\nthey are they're introducing the concept\nof um infrastructure as data. No\nconfiguration as data. C A yeah it's CA\nA and\nI really still don't know exactly how\ntheir platform but their platform.\nYes. Uh oh there's another one Napio but\nthere's one from\ntoday. It's definitely it's Brian Grant\nstartup. There's a one that was posted\nlike like maybe 12 hours ago from config\nhub where they go into the problems and\nthe solution of configuration as data.\nUm and in in the problems they are\nhighlighting like the ren the renovate\nbot approach. So if you version pin your\nmodules or version pin your helm charts\nthen you set up something like renovate\nto automatically create pull requests to\nupdate your things.\n>> Yeah. I mean actually at my workplace\nthey've written a beautiful like 100\nline uh Python script and what it does\nit's it's called distribute py and you\nyou can have a config to say like you\nwant these paths pushed to these repos\nor even I think even it supports like\nhierarchy. So, so basically like if if\nthey want to make sure that every team\nin dev has this new config set, they\npush it out or a new file in their in\ntheir repos, they just push it out\n>> so that everyone has a new workflow that\nthey they they can use or the or their\nworkflow in their in their repos.\nActually, this is what this thing is\nmissing repositories.\n>> Yeah. All of that mapped across repos.\nBut like uh I guess the repro would sit\nhere but like yeah it it pushes it out\nand they do this and they said like I\nsaid like wow I've never seen this\nbefore. So you didn't want to get the\npendot like a like a pullbase flow going\nlike he says no pullbase will not work\nin our organization. We need a push we\nneed to be fast and it needs to be\nupdated like immediately\n>> and I was like wow I've never seen that\nbefore.\n>> When they say push do they do do they go\nand create pull requests in the other on\nthe other ones? Direct commit.\n>> Direct commit. Yeah, they have like a\nbot and it just like just overwrites\nwhatever they have.\n>> So, this is my biggest issue with all of\nthese like cookie cutter and\nbootstrappers. Most of them they do a\nonetime bootstrap and they never\nconsider the the day to\nI created an issue about this in GitHub.\nUm, let me see if I can\n>> Oh, forget about GitHub template repos.\nI hate them. Every time I see somebody\nuse them, I I just immediately want to\nshut that down. It's like don't don't\n>> um yeah like here's my question here. Hi\nthere. How do you should a repository be\ngenerated from a template keep up to\ndate with an evolving template?\n>> Yeah,\n>> it says GitHub templates are designed\nfor onetime scaffolding.\nYeah. So\n>> I created a worm in my previous\norganization.\n>> So what do you mean to update stuff?\n>> Yeah. So whenever I created a PR on my\non my template repo, it would\nautomatically create commits in my other\nrepositories to pull it in to the to\npull in the diff from that PR. Uh except\nthat it would copy to itself and then\ntrigger itself. And I had to like\nexplicitly allow uh GitHub action\nworkflows to trigger themsel. And then I\nI I created like 70 plus emails per\nminute across the whole email system.\nAnd then my C after like half a day my\nmy CTO sent me a message like what's\nhappening? [laughter]\n>> What what do you mean you're sending\nemails to different people?\n>> Yeah.\n>> No, because GitHub action run started\nlike failing and sending emails like the\nthe run failed and so I was literally\nspend three hours killing killing action\nruns.\n>> Uh [laughter]\nit was a lot of fun. So I I had this\nidea as well like originally with with\ntemplate repos maybe like five years ago\nto to automate this push down to all of\nthe repos that all.\n>> So I I I mean in all in all honesty at\nthis particular client I think the push\nmechanism works quite well because you\nknow the relationship they have with the\nteams like\n>> you know like these are data teams they\ndon't know what they're doing. They need\nthis thing up to date now.\n>> And then the other thing is the moment I\nstarted using progen projen.io IO which\nis popular within the AWS CDK ecosystem.\nUm, Proen.io\nuh is kind of like the Pandaot. When you\nbootstrap a repository with with this\ntool, it sets up an update uh scheduled\nupdate uh system. So you can define like\nonce a week, daily, and you can also set\nup automerge and all that. and and and\nso what it does is it it runs the it it\ndownloads the latest version of the\ntemplate and it runs it and it basically\nmod like selfmutates and and keeps the\nrepo up to date and then automerges. So\nit's pool based but it happens\nautomatically\n>> but like but\nI I'm not too sure how we got here. We\nwere talking about uh configuration\n>> unpinning and pushing.\n>> I'm actually not sure dependabot is a\nvery scalable solution. Um well it\n>> uh so one thing I don't like about\ndependabot is that it creates so many\nPRs and and that's why I usually\ndisabled it but you can actually set up\ngrouping.\n>> Yeah I know there was one repository\nwhere I think I set up auto like\n>> auto actually how did I do that again?\nUh oh,\n>> you have to create a a GitHub token for\nan automerge uh bot to to\n>> I'm not too sure how I can find my own\nautomerge. What What should I search\nfor? H PR\n>> I use dependabots with um release please\nand automerge on my Golang CLI for\nTerraform. It's a public repo. You want\nto see it?\n>> Um okay. If you Well, I mean I've done\nit before. I just can't remember where I\ndone it.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. The problem um with dependabot is\noriginally my biggest issue was all of\nthe different PRs but you can set up\ngrouping rules. You can say like for\nthis buckets manager you group all the\nPRs um instead of creating like five PRs\nyou create one for go dependencies for\nexample and and then you set up the\n>> the question remains like you can't\nexpect all these different teams to\nbasically\n>> merge the PRs and that's where things\nreally That's why I don't think that\nwhat you mentioned earlier about the\npush flow is automatically committing to\nmaster. I think what it's doing is it's\ncreating a branch. It's creating a PR.\nIt's it ts it with a label and then it\nsaid it's pushing it straight to main.\nThey usually updating workflows. They\nonly usually do it for updating\nworkflows.\n>> I think it's either it's pull or push.\nIt doesn't really matter much. Um, but I\nhave the same flow which it just creates\nu a PR that the PR is labeled as\nautomerge and then you have an automerge\nbot that will auto approve actually\nsorry the PR is labeled as auto approve\nand then that bot will auto approve\nthose PRs and then it will enable the\nautomerge as soon as the checks pass. So\nI will never merge or commit straight to\nmaster.\n>> That's quite a complex setup but I guess\nit's\n>> I mean let me share my screen and I'll\nshow you the repository. It is a public\nreport.\nUh\noh, not what I\n>> is requesting you to allow multiple\npresenters to share. Okay, whatever.\n>> Okay, I'm sharing.\nWhich one am I sharing? This one. I\nguess\n>> I think we got to wind up in a couple of\nminutes just because I've got I got so\nmuch work today. Oh my god.\n>> And we never talked about we never\ntalked about AI. Oh god.\n>> [snorts]\n>> So here I have this Golang binary. It's\na fork from\n>> Are you sharing? I can't see it.\n>> Oh, sorry. You can see it now.\n>> Yeah, I can see it now.\n>> Maybe let me drag it out of all these\ntabs so it's a bit less confusing. So um\nI forked this from the Chan Zuckerberg\nFoundation, the wife of um some Facebook\ndude. I don't know.\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n>> And they create they have a um\n>> Oh, do do quick sign up. Do you know um\nSwix? Uh what's his real name? He's\nSingaporean guy.\n>> No, I mean you met him.\n>> Um I forgot his real name. I just call\nhim by his uh his handle. He did an\ninterview with Mark Zuckerberg like last\nweek.\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> Um so you know, one one connection away.\nOkay. Yeah. Carry on.\nSo, so this is a nonprofit that uses\nTerraform to bootstrap some of the\nservices that they use and they have a\nvery uh they have a lot of tooling there\nuh some of Golang like tooling and this\none is a very opinionated Terraform\nbootstrapper. Um, the reason I like it\nis because after using Terra Grant,\nhaving all of your different Terraform\nstate configurations spread across the\nrepo, it was very hard to keep track of\nlike exactly how things were organized.\nAnd so this uses a central manifest, a\ncentral YAML file that basically defines\nthe layout of the repository. Um the\nidea is that this gets used across\nproduct repos so that every every team\nis basically bootstrapping terraform the\nsame way and then you can update the\ntemplates and then every team updates\ntheir fog version and then it updates\nthe repository across right. Um I'm\nusing it in a monor repo way which is\nnot really the intended design. So I\nadded features to like distribute the\nconfig file. So I ended up with kind of\nlike an in between. Um but yeah, I I\nbasically forked it and I've been adding\na lot of features. But what we're\ntalking about is how do the releases\nhappen here, right? So in this case, I\nalso have this uh dependabot\nconfiguration to automatically update my\ngo dependencies and it doesn't directly\nmerge I mean it doesn't commit to\nmaster, right? It creates a different PR\nand it does a terapform group as you\nsee, right? It groups all of the\ndependencies that are related to\nTerraform uh modules and groups them all\ninto one place. So it picks up like um\nwe're getting the latest go-getter uh\nand if there's another module that is\nrelated to the terapform group, it will\nbe part of this PR and then what happens\nis it automatically lets adds the bot\nmerge label and that gets auto approved\nbut it's using my pat so it's showing me\nas the approver so it's using my GitHub\ntoken to approve this and as soon as all\nof the the the CI/CD passes on the pull\nrequest only then does it merge right\nit's it enables automerge and when\neverything like see it enables automerge\nAnd when all is good and all the tests\npass, then it gets merged. So you get a\nvery controlled way of of deploying.\n>> Your profile looks like the opposite of\nmy profile in GitHub. That's weird. Like\nI'm looking one direction, you're\nlooking the other direction.\n>> This is Scarface, right?\n>> Oh, that's not you.\n>> Not me. [laughter]\n>> Yeah. Um, so so that I like this. I like\nthis a lot. And what happens is all of\nthese u dependency updates get merged\nonto master and then Google release\nplease keeps track of them and basically\ntells me the next release that's going\nto happen is going to include all of\nthese bumps.\n>> But have have you used this in anger? I\nmean have you used this with several\nteams? I'm just wondering if this is\ngoing to work.\n>> So we use this CLI across our Terraform\nrepos but they're large. So we have like\ntwo or three of them and basically fog\nis dictating the the the layout of the\nterraform repo and integrating with\nAtlantis and also now integrating with\nTerra constructs. So it's bootstrapping\nTypeScript projects, it's setting up the\nTS config, it's setting up ES linting\nrules, everything. So so all of those\ntemplates are inside fog and I I still I\ndon't recommend it because uh we're\nusing it and it's working for us but\nsome people might not really like some\nof the things it does, right? Um but\nyeah it does the full repo remote and it\ncontrols some part of what the grid will\ndo. It controls how these components\nlink to each other. So it determines\nwhat is the remote state for that\ncomponent. So if you have a landing zone\ncomponent and you have a cluster\ncomponent and the cluster needs to to\nunderstand where is the network created\nby the landing zone then it will read\nthose outputs from each other. So that's\nthrough the remote state right so so\nit's a very opinionated way again\noriginally from from Chan Zuckerberg but\nI added a lot of features on top of\nthat.\n>> That's interesting. That's really\ninteresting. Nonetheless, I think I\nthink in in my current gig, the\nthe different teams are not really\nowning the infrastructure. So, I don't\nneed them to do a lot of complexity. I\njust need them to do the data type\nstuff. And I think I can control that\nbetter not using this. But I don't know.\nThis is really interesting. But, okay, I\ngot to wind up here because I got to I\ngot to go go straight into into work\nmode.\n>> Okay. Great talking with you. Um,\nunfortunately we didn't talk anything\nabout AI.\nI don't know, maybe maybe another\nmorning we can I can do the same thing.\nJust let me know.\n>> [ __ ] Actually, I I I found out remember\nyesterday we talked and I said that\nthere's um I was doing like a quick\ndashboard because I'm using beats to\ntrack issues for the LLM.\n>> Yeah, you showed me. That was great.\nYeah.\n>> But there are actually like six or seven\npeople doing the same thing.\n>> That's the beauty of AI, isn't it? It's\nso beautiful.\n>> Yeah. So, so I found some u kind of\nworking dashboard and it's pretty neat.\nIt gives you like a full overview of\nyour large features and your\n>> epics. Let's pick up on that next. Don't\nno more talking about infrastructure\nfull AI next talk. Okay.\n>> And uh I'm happy to wake up in the\nmorning. Just let me know what day suits\nyou.\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n>> Could be could even be tomorrow. I don't\nI don't mind. See you.\n>> Sounds good. Yep. See you. Bye.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:00] Well, good morning, Vincent.\n[0:02] >> Good morning.\n[0:03] >> It's been uh couple of weeks, hasn't it?\n[0:07] Or [snorts] something.\n[0:07] >> Yeah.\n[0:08] >> Yeah. Could be at least 10 days, I\n[0:11] think.\n[0:11] >> Yeah. I wanted to start by asking you a\n[0:17] couple of questions. Maybe\n[0:20] an info um let I mean, we're both\n[0:23] infrastructure engineers, so I have an\n[0:24] infrastructure question for you.\n[0:26] >> Okay. So this is a wonderful GitHub\n[0:29] account of this person here.\n[0:32] >> I was just trying to\n[0:42] >> so imagine there's like an AWS landscape\n[0:46] like this where where where the fruits\n[0:49] here are basically different teams,\n[0:51] right?\n[0:52] >> Yeah. So the so some teams have a dev\n[0:54] account, some some have a some have the\n[0:58] whole you know the whole shebang.\n[1:01] Um and actually this is not even\n[1:03] accurate like sometimes they can have\n[1:04] deployments in different regions right\n[1:06] could be U1\n[1:10] >> I should have sorry this is not the best\n[1:12] example but you know I was I had to be\n[1:15] quick about it. [snorts] Um so so each\n[1:19] team like potentially has\n[1:22] has a a number of deployments so we say\n[1:26] right I think that's the the correct\n[1:27] terminology because they could have a\n[1:29] deployment in USC East1 Singapore\n[1:34] same account\n[1:36] different environments and each\n[1:38] environment is mapped to an account.\n[1:39] Yeah. So the my question is is that like\n[1:42] I have a landscape like this in a in a\n[1:44] big company to manage and often enough\n[1:47] I'm like you know does team Mango have\n[1:51] stuff in this region and like I don't\n[1:54] know. Um but it's even worse. I mean if\n[1:58] I had this uh up to date Jason JSON I\n[2:01] probably could easily quickly answer\n[2:03] yeah okay they should have stuff in new\n[2:05] east one\n[2:06] >> but the trouble is that sometimes it's\n[2:08] it's up to the different teams to deploy\n[2:10] their own infrastructure so it's like\n[2:13] then again I don't even know if they've\n[2:14] actually really done deployments you\n[2:16] know what I mean it's like so as a\n[2:18] platform engineer I have to like sort of\n[2:20] keep an eye on what people are doing but\n[2:22] it's very difficult for me to keep it so\n[2:24] I thought to myself this example is one\n[2:26] I struggle with on a daily basis. Does\n[2:31] Tacos or your tool or I guess I mean\n[2:34] Terraform Cloud will probably be the\n[2:36] greatest tool for this but like how do I\n[2:38] track?\n[2:40] >> Yeah. So with with the grid what I I do\n[2:43] and I think other tools uh like Terra\n[2:46] Team or Digger or Spaceelift they also\n[2:48] have the concept of labels. So teams can\n[2:51] attach labels to states and you can\n[2:55] track if um if they are having states\n[3:00] for resources inside a certain region.\n[3:02] Now the problem could be if you are\n[3:04] doing multi-reional\n[3:05] terraform right if you could if you have\n[3:08] one state that creates um for example\n[3:12] VPC peering between two regions and then\n[3:14] creates the end points on one side and\n[3:15] then does the\n[3:16] >> that's a very good example that that\n[3:18] that's a kind of like special case I was\n[3:20] going to talk about next\n[3:22] >> but at the moment we've gone um yeah the\n[3:25] state file is separated per region yeah\n[3:28] >> which makes sense and another thing\n[3:30] before you start with\n[3:32] uh in my previous organizations we also\n[3:34] had the first question we ask do we\n[3:37] organize by team then by by by stage. So\n[3:40] for example in this case you have team\n[3:42] Apple has stages dev pro and u or do we\n[3:45] go by stage and then by team because um\n[3:49] do you first have like dev pro stage and\n[3:51] then within dev you have team A, team B,\n[3:53] team C and then within stage you have\n[3:56] team A. We had we had a I mean the\n[3:58] previous incarnation of of this cloud\n[4:00] deployment on the on this particular\n[4:02] client they had they had it whereby\n[4:05] there was like one dev account and all\n[4:07] the teams were on it\n[4:08] >> but we the people were stepping on each\n[4:10] other's toes all the time.\n[4:12] >> It's not necessarily like with well the\n[4:15] problem we were facing is from a dev sec\n[4:16] ops perspective the rules that apply to\n[4:19] non-production uh stages are different\n[4:22] from production. It's easier if you're\n[4:24] in AWS or manager to basically define\n[4:28] your um what's it called like the units\n[4:31] or the organizational units or use on\n[4:34] the stages level so that we could apply\n[4:37] security policies on the stages level.\n[4:39] Oh, you mean like stages as in these\n[4:41] environments?\n[4:42] >> Oh, use. Yeah, we have nested to use in\n[4:44] in AWS or right. So, we decided that it\n[4:47] would make more sense because we are\n[4:48] attaching our organization.\n[4:49] >> I never thought about that. I never\n[4:51] thought about that. That's a that's a\n[4:53] bloody good idea actually. What? I've\n[4:56] never done that before now. So, yeah.\n[4:58] So, you have a tree.\n[5:00] Uh how do I share that with you? where\n[5:03] we had a discussion between the platform\n[5:05] team lead and the dev sec ops team and\n[5:07] then how do we set up our OUS and how do\n[5:10] we manage our security policies in our\n[5:12] AWS and we had an existing setup where\n[5:15] we had like team A, team B, team C and\n[5:18] then we had dev staging and prod under\n[5:20] the teams and we switched it over to the\n[5:22] other way because we wanted to manage\n[5:23] our policies that way.\n[5:25] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Um\n[5:28] did so did AWS support you? No, not\n[5:31] really.\n[5:32] >> With AWS OUS, uh they can be like\n[5:35] nested, right? And you can attach\n[5:37] policies to the OU. So you can attach\n[5:39] the non-prod policies to the nonpro OUS\n[5:42] and then all of the teams operate within\n[5:44] those and then when you go to prod,\n[5:46] there's more guard rails and and\n[5:49] security.\n[5:49] >> So yeah, I see what you're saying. So\n[5:51] the policies\n[5:53] apply on top level top level I'm not\n[5:58] sure that's the right term stage.\n[6:01] >> Yeah.\n[6:02] >> And then and then that trickles down.\n[6:04] Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Why\n[6:06] haven't I done that? I feel dumb for not\n[6:08] having even done that.\n[6:11] >> I mean because you came from an\n[6:12] environment where they were sharing an\n[6:13] account and it was causing issues. But\n[6:16] AWS is actually at some point I read\n[6:20] this book from uh like microservices\n[6:22] from Sam Newman I think and he was like\n[6:26] saying in the book how AWS even goes so\n[6:30] far as to give every environment an\n[6:32] account. So that you know like team A\n[6:35] prod has one AWS account and team B prod\n[6:38] has a separate AWS account. Uh actually\n[6:42] even worse like team A has two services\n[6:44] FU and bar and then team A FU stage goes\n[6:47] into one account and team uh A bar stage\n[6:50] goes into another account which is like\n[6:53] so you need to do all of the peering and\n[6:55] like you know you can only connect uh or\n[6:57] communicate across account boundaries\n[7:00] which is crazy from like from a small\n[7:02] startup's perspective to to be to have\n[7:05] to have all of this AWS account\n[7:07] management overhead right [snorts] um\n[7:10] Another thing is what we wanted was the\n[7:12] ability to\n[7:14] um\n[7:16] [clears throat] vent an AWS account for\n[7:17] a team for a limited amount of time\n[7:19] >> and then once they were done with it\n[7:21] like return it to a pool. So we wanted\n[7:23] on demand account creation.\n[7:25] >> You return it to a pool then you just\n[7:26] destroy it.\n[7:27] >> Well that's the thing. Originally AWS\n[7:30] didn't have a lot of AWS uh a lot of API\n[7:33] for account management. So destroying an\n[7:36] account was very difficult.\n[7:37] >> Yeah. Yeah. I see what you're saying.\n[7:39] >> So, so the idea is to run\n[7:41] >> I made a video about that.\n[7:42] >> Yeah. So, the idea is is to run like\n[7:44] nukes and and and basically have a pool\n[7:47] of accounts and and cycle through them.\n[7:49] Uh which is a lot easier and there's a\n[7:50] lot of tools to do that.\n[7:52] >> Do you so you've used AWS Nuke? I think\n[7:55] it changed.\n[7:56] >> Uh there's two of them. I think I use\n[7:58] the other like there's one from Terra\n[8:01] Grant which is very popular or um not\n[8:03] Terra Grant but the Grunt Works nuke uh\n[8:05] that has been forked. I don't I don't\n[8:08] think I liked\n[8:09] >> you.\n[8:10] >> Yeah, I think the fork was better and\n[8:12] there's the grunt work one wasn't good.\n[8:14] There's a cl there's a cloud nuke uh\n[8:17] that supports multiploud. I I remember\n[8:19] going through all of them and only one\n[8:21] of them was really wellmaintained and\n[8:22] and well structured.\n[8:23] >> This is the one that is used in my\n[8:27] employer if I remember correctly.\n[8:30] I have one in my repo as well like it's\n[8:32] set up in lift and shift because I have\n[8:35] tags which is like uh nuke don't destroy\n[8:38] you can put a tag so it's 100% not going\n[8:40] to destroy some resources so I have\n[8:43] >> ah I I have cloud nuke and I have AWS\n[8:46] nuke which one am I using\n[8:49] >> initial p was done with cloud nuke which\n[8:51] was a best practice from terror test for\n[8:53] cleaning up but it was really bad and so\n[8:55] then I used reby AWS nuke which worked a\n[8:59] lot\n[9:00] Um, and then Ericson AWS Nuke. Yes. So\n[9:04] Christristen AWS Nuke is a fork from the\n[9:07] original Dby.\n[9:09] >> Yeah.\n[9:09] >> Yeah. I'm I'm a big fan of uh nuking uh\n[9:13] accounts or thermal environments. I made\n[9:15] a video about that again.\n[9:17] >> Big fan.\n[9:18] >> Yeah. So Okay. So what I'm Okay.\n[9:23] Okay. You you told me about this uh\n[9:25] stage level. Um\n[9:28] >> Yeah. U organization. That's cool. I\n[9:31] didn't uh think about that for some\n[9:32] reason or wasn't exposed to that. But\n[9:34] but still the question remains how how\n[9:36] do you how do I mean if I mean this is\n[9:39] going to be duplicated on each stage. Um\n[9:43] and then and then of course I mean let's\n[9:46] just be a little bit explicit then then\n[9:47] then again this is going to be you know\n[9:50] AP southeast one or something crazy\n[9:54] u east one they're going to have\n[9:57] different resources in different regions\n[10:00] US uh EU west two or something and then\n[10:04] and then just to make things even extra\n[10:07] spicy I'm not too sure if it's worth is\n[10:10] it worth putting it here yeah it is\n[10:12] because things are split by region. Like\n[10:15] for example, they have a they use a\n[10:16] database vendor. I'm not going to tell\n[10:18] the name of the vendor, but the vendor\n[10:21] itself has has this notion of uh\n[10:23] different sites. So you can have like a\n[10:28] London site\n[10:30] and uh I don't know an island site\n[10:34] and things on their AP southeast.\n[10:37] >> Yeah. So So um okay, let's just put over\n[10:40] there. So, so\n[10:43] yeah, it doesn't make sense there. It\n[10:45] should be over there. I can't get over\n[10:47] there very easy. Well, let me just US\n[10:50] one or something. So what I'm trying to\n[10:53] say here is that like I I think\n[10:56] hopefully you see the pain is like at\n[10:58] the moment like do we separate the state\n[11:01] by you know this uh path\n[11:05] or do we clump the state together even\n[11:09] though the database is actually designed\n[11:14] >> uh potentially to be separate actually\n[11:17] >> because it's like a backup\n[11:19] >> and like I'm just like my head is\n[11:21] turning like just tracking this is\n[11:23] making my head spin. Never mind uh you\n[11:27] know uh\n[11:30] the other aspects of operating this plat\n[11:34] this platform.\n[11:36] Yeah. I mean I think the easy way\n[11:39] forward always and this is why I think\n[11:41] infrastructure as code and really being\n[11:43] able to to treat infrastructure as code\n[11:47] um it involves things like refactoring,\n[11:50] right? So I think we should just go\n[11:52] forward with merged like dry\n[11:56] >> yagny you ain't going to need it type of\n[11:58] approach merging everything.\n[12:00] >> Yeah.\n[12:00] >> And then and then at the point that that\n[12:03] it's like oh actually we're facing\n[12:04] issues because of contention on the\n[12:06] locks state locks or whatever or because\n[12:08] of um the terapform plan takes too long\n[12:12] or whatever at that point there then\n[12:14] refactoring needs to be uh done. So of\n[12:17] course we need to have like a road map\n[12:19] and a target And it's such a pain. It's\n[12:22] such a pain to refactor cuz we we have\n[12:24] like kind of like teams bothering us all\n[12:28] the time saying no you can't change this\n[12:29] or like you know this is going to be\n[12:31] disruptive.\n[12:32] >> Uh I mean uh I mean it's not that\n[12:34] disruptive but like just\n[12:37] >> getting uh you know some of these\n[12:39] account uh some of these state files are\n[12:41] so like high security that it's like a\n[12:44] pain just to move from one place to\n[12:46] another.\n[12:47] >> Okay, I can understand that. But one\n[12:48] thing right from experience running with\n[12:50] Terraform a lot is that you must be able\n[12:53] to rename things. So that's why I want\n[12:56] to decouple my logical identities from\n[12:58] their actual physical identities. But\n[13:01] then at the same time uh my original\n[13:03] plan with with like the library that I\n[13:05] wrote is that you don't get to determine\n[13:07] your identities right if you use Google\n[13:09] cloud or other providers usually you\n[13:11] create a resource you don't determine\n[13:13] the ID behind the scene it's determined\n[13:15] for you. So if you change a name or a\n[13:17] description, it's not only recreated.\n[13:19] Um, and that's good for a lot of\n[13:21] scenarios, but it doesn't work like for\n[13:22] S3 bucket or an RDS maybe, but even then\n[13:25] for an RDS, it shouldn't you shouldn't\n[13:28] force the identity on it because then\n[13:30] when you need to move things, then it\n[13:31] becomes disruptive. But ideally moving a\n[13:34] resource between two different states\n[13:36] where it's being managed shouldn't be\n[13:37] disruptive. It should just be like I'm\n[13:40] moving. It's an interesting little thing\n[13:41] that you said there because like we have\n[13:43] a com we have a config YAML which we\n[13:46] essentially give to each team because\n[13:49] each team essentially manages I think\n[13:52] what we call a data product\n[13:56] um they could have multiple data\n[13:58] products but let's just say\n[14:01] it's one to one even though it's not and\n[14:04] in that config.yaml YAML\n[14:06] we there's a whole bunch of\n[14:08] configuration as as we all know and like\n[14:10] for example\n[14:13] uh feel free to disagree with this on\n[14:15] but like at at this point in time we\n[14:17] actually allow them to set what the ids\n[14:20] are and these ids are you know cascade\n[14:24] and in in all sorts of weird and\n[14:26] wonderful ways\n[14:28] >> to name different resources and you know\n[14:30] like you know how like AWS likes dashes\n[14:32] and then\n[14:33] >> another thing likes underscores and\n[14:37] doesn't allow you to use those\n[14:38] characters.\n[14:39] >> Other things can't be longer than a 20\n[14:41] characters or something crazy like that\n[14:42] or whatever.\n[14:43] >> But like at the at this point in time,\n[14:46] we actually allow team Mango like I mean\n[14:50] you know if Mango wanted to be a pair\n[14:52] the next day we allow that but it causes\n[14:55] absolutely mayhem honestly.\n[14:57] >> Absolutely. Yeah. Uh so this is what I\n[15:00] mean I come from an like accounting\n[15:02] background right and accounting entries\n[15:04] when you want to slice and dice and\n[15:05] analyze your data you use dimensions. So\n[15:07] you attach in in AWS parlins this is uh\n[15:10] tags right labels and and and all of\n[15:14] this is mutable. So you can create\n[15:16] reports that aggregate by certain keys\n[15:18] and then um that's why a tagging policy\n[15:22] is super important and and that's why\n[15:24] also the same with the like the um\n[15:28] the example here of like how do you\n[15:30] organize your states? Do you organize\n[15:31] them by that and then by by team or vice\n[15:34] versa? Those should all be labeling. Uh\n[15:36] >> yeah, we we do tag we do tag quite\n[15:39] aggressively. But like but but does\n[15:41] tagging really even help here? Like if\n[15:44] if if some if team mango decided to\n[15:46] become team pair or something,\n[15:49] >> it shouldn't it it shouldn't be any\n[15:50] problem then, right? If if the team team\n[15:53] tag is is really a tag and not tied into\n[15:56] any resource identity, changing the\n[15:58] identity, sorry, changing the tag\n[16:00] doesn't affect the identity. So\n[16:02] everything that depends on it is still\n[16:03] pointing the original identity.\n[16:04] >> Oh, I think I see what you're saying. So\n[16:06] instead of instead of like focusing on\n[16:08] changing I don't know the C resource or\n[16:12] the stack name you change the the tag\n[16:14] name.\n[16:15] >> Yes. And then you can like always\n[16:17] redefine or because I worked at everyone\n[16:20] worked at organizations and business\n[16:22] development teams or organ or the a like\n[16:25] the the sorry the the C level decides to\n[16:28] reorganize and and and rename the teams\n[16:31] merge the teams and it causes a mayhem\n[16:33] on the infrastructure level because of\n[16:35] um logical\n[16:36] >> not good advice. physical identity,\n[16:38] sorry, physical identity should never be\n[16:41] um attached to u should never be\n[16:44] dictated by by the the organization or\n[16:47] the the product name. Um and I think\n[16:49] some clouds don't allow you that, right?\n[16:52] The problem is a ter provider and AWS\n[16:54] APIs allows you to do that and they even\n[16:56] have like this pre uh\n[16:58] >> this prefix like ID prefix thing. That's\n[17:01] all.\n[17:02] >> You're so right, Vincent. Jesus, I wish\n[17:05] I was working with you. I'm learning a\n[17:07] lot just just to get chatting with you\n[17:09] every hour.\n[17:11] >> The problem that you're going to get\n[17:12] weeks\n[17:13] >> I tried to introduce this at a company\n[17:14] and I got a massive um push back from\n[17:19] engineers because they are used to use\n[17:20] to do click ops in the AWS console and\n[17:23] they're like I can't find my resources.\n[17:26] It was cloud for stacks and the way the\n[17:28] cloud form like um calculates the\n[17:31] physical ID name was very confusing\n[17:32] because of the nested stack way of doing\n[17:34] it that causes its own set of problems\n[17:36] because then you lose resources just\n[17:38] because you rename a stack now the\n[17:40] resources logical identity no longer map\n[17:42] and it just loses track of it. So they\n[17:44] they are adding more features to like\n[17:46] manage refactoring of resources which\n[17:47] Terraform already does for you. Uh but\n[17:49] then the push back was from the\n[17:50] engineers that are used to go into the\n[17:52] AWS console and I can't find my specific\n[17:54] radius instance or my specific load\n[17:56] balancer because the name is so and I'm\n[17:58] like you the problem is the dashboard if\n[18:01] you don't have a proper dashboard that\n[18:02] shows you the tags and shows you to like\n[18:04] slice and dice your resources by the\n[18:06] tags\n[18:08] >> to data dog's credit data dog actually\n[18:10] does a good job of servicing all the\n[18:11] tags\n[18:12] >> and that's what it should be right\n[18:14] >> console doesn't like I swear to god I\n[18:16] was dealing I can't remember what it was\n[18:18] but I was dealing with something the\n[18:19] other day in in AWS and it didn't have\n[18:23] bloody tags or it didn't show the tags.\n[18:25] >> Yeah, tags are not everywhere in AWS. Um\n[18:28] and and also not everywhere cuz there's\n[18:31] a convention a lot of resources if you\n[18:33] put a tag with the key name it shows up\n[18:35] in the UI as the actual resource name uh\n[18:38] nicely like for example on EC2 instance\n[18:40] you cannot control the instance ID but\n[18:42] you put on a tag with a name and then\n[18:43] the dash the the the dash\n[18:46] >> the web stores it nicely. Yeah,\n[18:48] >> but some of them don't like the RDS\n[18:50] because the RDS and the end point URL\n[18:52] for the RDS as well.\n[18:56] >> These are teams because every team works\n[18:57] independently, right?\n[18:59] >> Yeah. There should be like, you know, a\n[19:01] bezos whatever mandate, make sure that\n[19:04] everything's bloody tag or tagable.\n[19:07] >> Yeah. So I think they're doing a lot of\n[19:09] work there with like the resource\n[19:11] manager uh that the t you have now the\n[19:14] ability to like review all of your\n[19:16] resources across your across your AWS\n[19:18] orc uh using the resource manager and\n[19:20] then using tags. So there are separate\n[19:23] services focused just on that on like\n[19:25] managing resources and finding your\n[19:27] resources.\n[19:28] >> Cool. Cool. Okay. So\n[19:30] >> I really like your tips here, but but\n[19:32] still the question remains given a\n[19:35] platform like this with lots of uh teams\n[19:38] and things like this. I is is the is the\n[19:41] grid the right tool to make to to keep\n[19:43] an eye on all all this stuff or what\n[19:45] would you suggest?\n[19:48] Because I need to know what's going on\n[19:50] here sometimes. Otherwise,\n[19:53] >> when people ask me, \"Has Gene Mango got\n[19:55] the thing in London?\" I'll be like, \"Um,\n[19:58] >> I think you should research to system.\"\n[20:00] I can't speak. I think you should re\n[20:03] reach out to system initiative because\n[20:05] he's often posting about like um they\n[20:08] have a programmable graph that [snorts]\n[20:09] allows people to manage their\n[20:12] >> system initiative. I\n[20:13] >> so Adam and uh his colleagues uh demoed\n[20:17] it to to to us\n[20:19] >> works.\n[20:20] >> Yeah. And uh to be honest, I I was a\n[20:24] complete [ __ ] but you know, you got\n[20:26] to give me credit because I\n[20:28] >> as usual. [laughter]\n[20:30] >> So, so he Yeah. So, system initiative,\n[20:33] they demoed this like, you know, like\n[20:35] this big square. I don't know why that's\n[20:36] like that.\n[20:37] >> And then you have your your VPCs and\n[20:40] things like this. Like, first off, I was\n[20:42] like, ah man,\n[20:43] >> I hate it when you you start\n[20:45] infrastructure from a networking\n[20:47] perspective, but I get it. But I I hate\n[20:49] it like\n[20:50] like you know like if you want Yeah. VPC\n[20:53] this VPC that\n[20:56] because I just I just hate it. I hate\n[20:58] like a a focus on you know network based\n[21:02] infrastructure. I prefer to think of\n[21:04] things as I don't know like this level\n[21:07] and then and then it goes on like\n[21:09] whatever to um eventually you know EC2\n[21:13] and things like this. Um but then the\n[21:17] thing that really got me was like okay\n[21:19] so you you're creating resources la\n[21:22] >> and then I was like how do you like\n[21:24] maintain the state and all that stuff?\n[21:26] He says oh this is just this is what it\n[21:29] is right now.\n[21:31] >> It was like a onetoone mapping and then\n[21:32] I go like oh so how do you do that? How\n[21:35] do you like connect to the terraform\n[21:36] provider? He says oh we just run AWS CLI\n[21:39] CLI commands under the\n[21:41] >> Yeah. Yeah. And I was like\n[21:42] >> this is crazy. No, no, this cannot work.\n[21:45] >> I I initially wanted to contribution\n[21:50] of this year at the beginning of the\n[21:51] year was to like find an open source\n[21:54] project and contribute to it. And I was\n[21:56] like, okay, SI is it. I'm going to look\n[21:58] into it. And the moment they showed me\n[22:00] like linked me to the TypeScript under\n[22:02] the hood, which is literally just\n[22:04] calling the AWS CLI, I was like, there's\n[22:07] so much autogenerated APIs like the\n[22:09] telephone provider autogenerated. Um why\n[22:12] would you like go down to just scripting\n[22:15] around the CLI like literally TypeScript\n[22:17] TypeScript OSX um the thing is that's I\n[22:21] think is an implementation detail\n[22:23] because the idea of every\n[22:25] um component there being uh it's a a\n[22:30] programmable graph right the point is\n[22:32] that there are simple um imperative type\n[22:36] of scripts I think it works better for\n[22:37] people that are used to simple that are\n[22:40] like like to write uh a script in YAML.\n[22:43] Um basically every arrow, every\n[22:46] component has like um their own create,\n[22:49] read, update hooks and those invoke the\n[22:52] scripts and they build a whole bunch of\n[22:54] components with all of their CRUD hooks.\n[22:56] For example, a VPC that has the create\n[22:57] hook, the read hook, the update hook\n[22:59] that directly maps to the AWS CLI\n[23:01] commands. And that's basically SI built\n[23:03] the graph with the hooks that are\n[23:05] invocable like functions. And then they\n[23:07] built the whole bunch of like components\n[23:09] that are using that graph. So then when\n[23:11] they create the VPC, it goes and runs\n[23:12] that AWS CLI command, that AWS CLI\n[23:14] command when you want to update it. And\n[23:18] I mean I I think it comes back to the\n[23:20] the question like why doesn't Terraform\n[23:22] do that also, right? Because Terapform\n[23:24] is just talking to the AWS API. It could\n[23:26] just go and find all of the resources\n[23:28] that supposedly exists based on tags\n[23:30] because that's what um Hashimoto\n[23:32] originally did for Terraform. uh they\n[23:34] were just creating resources and using\n[23:36] tags on the resources to find them.\n[23:37] >> It's funny you mentioned it. I was\n[23:39] randomly watching a video and he talks\n[23:41] about Terraform as a graph API and like\n[23:44] well okay but where's your\n[23:46] representation of the graph?\n[23:49] So, so there's this interesting\n[23:51] Terraform issue where uh they ask\n[23:53] Hashimoto like why didn't you just um\n[23:56] you know attack like why do you need\n[23:58] state like get rid of the state file and\n[24:00] he highlighted all of the issues that\n[24:01] you get if you don't have a state file\n[24:03] if you don't um I think one of them was\n[24:05] speed um there was others because the\n[24:08] physical identity changes if the tag\n[24:10] changes um so they tried it and they\n[24:13] said and it didn't really work so um\n[24:16] basically you're saying that Hashimoto\n[24:18] did try something what system initiative\n[24:20] did but it was just not going to work\n[24:24] >> a long time ago right and I think things\n[24:25] changed a lot so I don't know um I think\n[24:28] there's some interesting ideas uh but I\n[24:31] had the same reaction when I looked at\n[24:33] the system initiative when I really\n[24:35] lifted up the the whole\n[24:36] >> feel for dismissing the whole idea\n[24:39] because I just thought like it wasn't\n[24:41] going to work just instinctively but but\n[24:44] now yeah now I mean I started this\n[24:47] conversation saying that I need I need\n[24:49] to see a visualization and then we just\n[24:52] go back to system initiative.\n[24:56] [snorts] Uh yeah, I mean I guess they\n[24:59] they could convince us in the end. I\n[25:02] think this is one of the main what I\n[25:04] learned from building my library is that\n[25:07] the framework in itself maybe is\n[25:09] approaching the problem from a certain\n[25:10] way but the actual utility comes from\n[25:13] the library of components that comes\n[25:15] with it because like you can interact\n[25:17] with the cloud however you want like you\n[25:19] want to use a state file or you want to\n[25:21] use a kubernetes operator or you want to\n[25:23] build pulley um you know typescript to\n[25:25] every possible language sure go ahead do\n[25:28] all of that the problem is if you cannot\n[25:31] give me a nice library of components. If\n[25:34] you like when I looked at crossplane,\n[25:35] there was no proper um you know\n[25:37] available publicly available set of\n[25:39] crossplane um resources that I could use\n[25:41] with AWS. I would need to build\n[25:43] everything out of the box. Uh and the\n[25:45] only framework that really has this is\n[25:46] AWS CDK, right? Because it comes out of\n[25:49] the box not just with the low-level AWS\n[25:52] API interface but also with the\n[25:54] integration patterns of how you use\n[25:56] these services together. And then the\n[25:57] other framework that does that is SSI\n[25:59] which is uh sorry SST not SSI what the\n[26:02] hell uh SST which is basically using\n[26:04] Palumi those basic components and then\n[26:06] building highle system integration\n[26:08] patterns on top of it\n[26:09] >> just to service integration\n[26:11] >> just to repeat what my understanding\n[26:12] what you just said you just like you got\n[26:14] to use the tool that has the best\n[26:15] coverage of the of the resources that\n[26:18] you're trying to use.\n[26:19] >> Yeah. And the services uh the\n[26:20] integrations have um integration\n[26:22] patterns between services because if you\n[26:24] use AWS you must know every single\n[26:25] service integrated with IM kind of\n[26:28] practical look at it.\n[26:29] >> Yeah and and and this is what what\n[26:31] system initiative I think spent 5 years\n[26:33] doing they started they had to spend\n[26:35] after they have the basic framework they\n[26:37] have to spend all this time to building\n[26:39] all of the components for AWS writing\n[26:42] every single AWS CLI script for every\n[26:44] single hook that a component um needs to\n[26:47] you know invoke whenever couldn't have\n[26:49] gone down that path of uh what did you\n[26:51] show me that was autogenerated? Oh my I\n[26:53] forgot the name of it.\n[26:54] >> There there is AWSC uh like cloud\n[26:58] control provider that's autogenerated\n[27:00] from the AWS API but again on its own\n[27:02] that doesn't really help because\n[27:04] creating a single API resource does not\n[27:07] give you the functionality that you need\n[27:09] out of the AWS API because the AWS API\n[27:12] effectively is a combination of many\n[27:14] resources working together in a certain\n[27:16] configured way. But the but system\n[27:19] initiative since they since they\n[27:22] rely on AWS CLI the AWS CLI surely is\n[27:25] their interface and that's there.\n[27:28] >> Sure. But the AWS CL CLI is also just\n[27:30] autogenerated wrapper around most of the\n[27:33] AWS APIs, right? It doesn't give you\n[27:35] like the idea of AWS CDK. The example\n[27:38] that I like to give is I have an EC2\n[27:40] instance and I want it to give it\n[27:41] permission to an IM uh to an S3 bucket.\n[27:44] I want I have an EC2 instance and I want\n[27:45] to give it access to an S3 bucket.\n[27:47] Right? So now look at how many resources\n[27:51] you need to create. Right?\n[27:54] >> Maybe you say, \"Oh, but that's a very\n[27:56] common pattern in my organization. So I\n[27:58] create a terapform module that combines\n[27:59] the two and then later down the line you\n[28:01] have a situation where the S3 bucket\n[28:03] actually needs to trigger a lambda\n[28:05] whenever the the S3 instance does\n[28:07] something or whatever or needs to be\n[28:08] hooked up to an SNS and you keep\n[28:10] extending that original very simple\n[28:12] basic pattern until it becomes a massive\n[28:14] like module with you know 40 different\n[28:16] parameters to configure whatever use\n[28:18] cases you now have after two years of of\n[28:21] using AWS and evolving your product. Um\n[28:24] I think the right way is what what they\n[28:27] are doing with AWS CDK is the actual\n[28:29] service teams and the community building\n[28:31] proper um patterns around these things\n[28:34] such as you know with abstractions such\n[28:36] as I have an I principle I have an uh\n[28:38] resource and I can grant a principle\n[28:40] access to a resource and if the I\n[28:42] principle is an AWS instance and it\n[28:44] needs to implement this this this\n[28:46] interface that means it must have an IM\n[28:48] role that I can refer to. So who can\n[28:51] build up under the\n[28:52] >> hood idea of encapsulated u I guess my\n[28:55] favorite one in AWS is the the\n[28:57] serverless SAM stuff.\n[28:59] >> Yeah.\n[29:00] >> Here's an example that got my head\n[29:03] spinning the other day. Um\n[29:06] so a colleague was telling me that when\n[29:09] you use ECS it creates like a bucket\n[29:12] behind the scenes. And the trouble is in\n[29:15] our in in the organization that I'm what\n[29:18] I'm working with, they're so strict\n[29:19] about all their their bucket policies\n[29:22] and things like that. Like for example,\n[29:24] I think you have to have a bucket policy\n[29:27] with some deny on it or something like\n[29:29] that. Like just off the bat when you\n[29:31] create a but the trouble is that ECS\n[29:34] creates a bucket and it doesn't it\n[29:37] relies on that bucket not having the\n[29:38] policy for it to work. So, so basically\n[29:41] this colleague of mine was telling me\n[29:43] that they were using ECS and it wasn't\n[29:45] working and they couldn't figure out\n[29:46] what the hell the problem [laughter] was\n[29:49] because like if you look around ECS\n[29:51] documentation, you won't you won't see\n[29:54] that you know ECS requires this bucket\n[29:56] to work.\n[29:58] >> It's kind of hidden away.\n[30:00] >> Yeah. And then so so basically that's to\n[30:03] show I mean that's that's me trying to\n[30:04] give come up with a dumb counter example\n[30:06] to these abstractions because then you\n[30:08] just don't know what the hell's going on\n[30:09] sometimes.\n[30:11] >> Um especially if they use\n[30:12] >> so here the extraction is the user\n[30:14] interface that AWS creates and when you\n[30:16] create the button under the hood it\n[30:18] calls many different APIs to create the\n[30:19] bucket and whatever. And when you then\n[30:21] need to capture that into infrastructure\n[30:23] as code now suddenly you have to go and\n[30:25] figure out bucket policy get cascades\n[30:27] down into that bucket you're screwed.\n[30:31] You know what I mean?\n[30:32] >> Okay. Yeah. What you're saying is\n[30:34] >> a stupid example. It shouldn't really\n[30:36] happen, but it it happened.\n[30:38] >> No, but like these things happen all the\n[30:40] time. Like I am I'm very annoyed when\n[30:44] people click ops things into a\n[30:46] non-production envir uh sorry into a\n[30:48] production environment because there's a\n[30:52] time limit. There's a time constraint\n[30:53] and they didn't have time to do to do\n[30:55] the ISC. they clicked it in on in dev\n[30:57] then they clicked it in in staging and\n[30:59] now there's a deadline and they need to\n[31:00] do it um because the IC doesn't work for\n[31:04] example\n[31:05] >> when you when you click something in\n[31:08] >> it will maybe enable a service uh uh\n[31:10] linked role into the AWS account\n[31:13] automatically so like you you start\n[31:15] using an AWS service if you use user\n[31:17] >> interface it does a lot of things and\n[31:19] you don't even know what it is it's so\n[31:20] hard to capture\n[31:21] >> and that's what I like about AWS CDK\n[31:24] because it actually capt captures all of\n[31:26] those actions. It's like a user\n[31:29] interface but a programmatic one. So\n[31:31] it's built to cap like it's almost the\n[31:34] same. I mean honestly when you use AWS\n[31:37] CDK and you have a bucket and you have a\n[31:39] lambda and you need to connect it to\n[31:40] under the hood it's going to make sure\n[31:42] that there's a resource policy that\n[31:43] there's an IM lambda permission whatever\n[31:45] if the bucket needs\n[31:46] >> are you confident that like the the the\n[31:47] AWS console and the CDK are are\n[31:50] synologist or onetoone because I'm I'm\n[31:53] always a bit doubtful that they are\n[31:55] >> very doubtful\n[31:57] >> I am very confident that\n[32:00] >> 90% of the time they are because I\n[32:03] believe AWS uses CDK internally as well\n[32:05] to build their products. I believe that\n[32:07] the teams that build the API interfaces\n[32:09] of those services actually contribute to\n[32:11] AWS CDK to capture these things.\n[32:14] >> And\n[32:14] >> so did you say 80% because like yeah\n[32:16] that's a lot better than say Terraform\n[32:18] where I'm probably like 10% you know.\n[32:20] >> Oh absolutely. Terraform is a nightmare.\n[32:22] Um and and and having an autogenerated\n[32:24] Terraform provider is not going to solve\n[32:26] the problem again because the the\n[32:27] low-level API resources are not the\n[32:30] solution. It's a combination of them.\n[32:32] And and then the comment I get a lot on\n[32:34] Reddit is like, \"Yeah, but if you're\n[32:37] using a programming language to do\n[32:38] infrastructure, you're doing it wrong.\"\n[32:40] And the reality is again\n[32:44] the the the cloud is not as basic as it\n[32:48] used to be. It's not just about creating\n[32:50] network subnets and and EC2 instances\n[32:52] and allocating network interfaces. uh\n[32:55] and that used to be probably quite\n[32:57] simple but now you have like IBV6 then\n[32:59] you have like your flow logs then you\n[33:01] have uh a flow log bucket and then you\n[33:03] have all kinds of uh integration\n[33:04] patterns across different services and I\n[33:07] mean case in point\n[33:09] >> so sorry can you just rephrase that like\n[33:10] who said like if you if you're using\n[33:12] infrastructure you're doing it wrong\n[33:13] what\n[33:14] >> no if you're using programming languages\n[33:16] like full\n[33:17] >> oh right\n[33:18] >> like full uh what's it called to\n[33:20] incomplete programming languages to to\n[33:22] write infrastructure as code you're\n[33:24] doing it That's a very common um\n[33:26] argument against using general purpose\n[33:29] programming language. The the most\n[33:30] common argument is um we just need a\n[33:32] config file. We just need to do a\n[33:34] declarative and we need to keep it\n[33:36] simple and it will be fine.\n[33:37] >> Y yeah\n[33:39] to be honest I'm usually in that camp\n[33:41] but uh but it bites all the time.\n[33:44] >> Well you you can be in that camp until\n[33:46] you do something actual real work and\n[33:48] then you realize that that that's a very\n[33:50] naive approach. And then every time I I\n[33:52] I I come with that argument, people say,\n[33:54] \"Oh, I worked at like hundred different\n[33:57] country large organization and we have\n[33:59] no problem.\" I don't believe it. I don't\n[34:01] believe you have a problem or I don't\n[34:03] believe you work at such an\n[34:04] organization. If you think that it's so\n[34:05] simple to just use terapform\n[34:07] configuration.\n[34:12] >> Yeah, I'm just trying to capture what\n[34:13] we're saying in a nice graphic\n[34:16] in a nice slide. Uh\n[34:19] >> so there's this these efforts from the\n[34:21] community to use basic terapform modules\n[34:23] to capture all of these usage patterns\n[34:25] and very quickly those modules become\n[34:27] just I mean what I was going to say\n[34:29] >> one\n[34:30] >> yeah what what I was going to say is\n[34:32] case in point um the argument that the\n[34:35] terraform sorry the argument that the\n[34:37] cloud is simple and we just need to use\n[34:38] basic declarative configuration just go\n[34:41] look at the of the VPC module just go\n[34:44] look at the VPC module look at how many\n[34:46] um variables there are input variables\n[34:48] because you can do um IMAP uh sorry\n[34:51] what's it called when you have IP\n[34:52] manager um IP man no the the basically\n[34:56] managed IP EPOM yeah IP uh yeah that\n[34:59] sounds right so you can do you can set\n[35:01] up a cider to control the you know cider\n[35:05] subet allocations\n[35:07] um you can do your flow locks you can so\n[35:08] the amount of of of things that you can\n[35:11] do is so big that if you look at that\n[35:14] module\n[35:15] >> uh alone you will notice that there's\n[35:17] like you know I don't know so many\n[35:19] different Torah form configuration files\n[35:21] each one has a locals block that has\n[35:22] multiple indirection layers on top of\n[35:24] the uh putting Julio variable that needs\n[35:28] to be set to true before the whole\n[35:29] module can be used u but then you have\n[35:32] so much in there that\n[35:35] you know you can't tell me that you just\n[35:37] need a very basic and then and then the\n[35:39] um the response is usually oh no problem\n[35:42] I just take that beautiful module that\n[35:43] has all of these things because people\n[35:44] contribute epam I need IPv6 support. I\n[35:48] need net instance support because I\n[35:49] don't want to pay through my nose for\n[35:51] net instances. Uh sorry, I don't want to\n[35:53] pay for net gateways. I just want to\n[35:54] spin up an instance and and save 20% um\n[35:57] sorry and save 80% of the cost of of\n[36:00] net. Um so I need all of these features.\n[36:02] So I just take that module, I remove\n[36:04] what I don't want and I keep it simple.\n[36:06] But then you have to maintain your own\n[36:07] version of that module. And as things\n[36:08] are being introduced, you need to like\n[36:10] merge upstream down into your stuff. And\n[36:14] basically everyone is just forking um\n[36:17] shared resources and then keeping their\n[36:20] own private copy of it and then how many\n[36:22] people actually contribute back to it.\n[36:24] Yeah,\n[36:24] >> I think that's that's just a\n[36:26] >> in my current client we have so many\n[36:28] different constructs and uh\n[36:31] >> they're using AWS CDK, right? and they\n[36:33] are trying\n[36:33] >> well we're mix now we're using a mix\n[36:35] between CDK and ter but historically\n[36:37] they were using CDK\n[36:40] >> yeah it works but yeah it's but but we\n[36:43] have that problem as you describe so\n[36:45] there's nothing that to help me\n[36:46] visualize this Vincent [ __ ]\n[36:50] >> well does\n[36:52] >> you have access to the grid\n[36:55] >> um but\n[36:58] uh\n[36:59] >> so what the grid does is right now I\n[37:01] mean the grid But can the grid can can\n[37:04] the grid I remember the grid taking in\n[37:07] terraform state but can it can can it\n[37:09] also take in CDK state because this is a\n[37:11] mix between CDK and Terraform right now.\n[37:14] This is this is another thing that makes\n[37:16] my life extra exciting.\n[37:20] Uh um right now the grid\n[37:23] >> new requirements new requirements.\n[37:24] >> So the grid is you can look at the grid\n[37:26] as like two two way you have one is the\n[37:28] control plane and two is a data plane.\n[37:29] The control plane is the is the way of\n[37:31] creating states and metadata around the\n[37:33] states such as the labels such as the\n[37:35] team or the the stage or the\n[37:38] >> why do you why do you say labels is just\n[37:41] labels and\n[37:41] >> tax is a very AWS specific terminology\n[37:44] >> okay carry on\n[37:45] >> labels is closer to K cubernetes way of\n[37:47] doing things like in in Kubernetes you\n[37:49] have labels and annotations I just um\n[37:51] have the key value pair\n[37:53] >> what's annotation again then\n[37:54] >> annotations you can apply to resources\n[37:57] then I think there's two different um\n[38:00] programmatic parts. One of them is meant\n[38:02] to be like the label queries are meant\n[38:04] to be much faster to query across the\n[38:06] state and the annotation is less\n[38:08] queryable. I think that's why they\n[38:10] separate the two.\n[38:11] >> Wow. An annotation is um\n[38:15] >> some information that you can like the\n[38:17] annotations you were using for like on\n[38:20] an ingress manifest. You may have an\n[38:21] annotation that the controller is\n[38:23] enginex ingress for example and another\n[38:25] ingress manifest might be controlled by\n[38:26] another um um ingress controller. So\n[38:30] that goes into annotations but the\n[38:32] labels is like um you want to do label\n[38:34] queries against the resources to find\n[38:36] them. I know that when it when they were\n[38:38] asked about like in Kubernetes why do\n[38:40] you separate labels and annotations and\n[38:42] the response was one is much more f like\n[38:45] performs much better to query.\n[38:48] >> Yeah because you know everything in\n[38:49] Kubernetes is uses label queries to to\n[38:52] select resources. Right.\n[38:54] >> Right.\n[38:55] >> So you don't you don't have Okay. So\n[38:57] there's no CDK. Okay. There's there's\n[38:59] nothing that that will help.\n[39:00] >> No. Right. Now the the grid is purely\n[39:02] for Terraform state. The problem with\n[39:04] CDK is it's cloud form, right? Cloud\n[39:07] form manages the stacks.\n[39:08] >> Couldn't you add a source for cloud for\n[39:12] >> I think I think if you look at spacelift\n[39:14] or um mass driver, they may they support\n[39:18] both. I think the way that you describe\n[39:20] your um your your your your employer's\n[39:25] um what do you call it infrastructure is\n[39:27] that you you had you had CDK and then\n[39:30] you and then and then you oh and then\n[39:33] you get it and then you and then you\n[39:35] converted to to Terraform. Oh [ __ ] You\n[39:38] don't use you don't use ter you don't\n[39:40] use CDK at all do you? [ __ ] I now\n[39:42] remember your your setup.\n[39:44] >> You translate everything.\n[39:45] >> I worked at different companies.\n[39:47] >> Okay. Okay. So everything's terraform\n[39:48] basically.\n[39:51] >> I'll tell you that my my issue was um\n[39:54] before we have cloud formation on one\n[39:56] team and terraform on another team and\n[39:58] as a platform team for example we like\n[40:00] to create our landing zone using\n[40:01] terraform. So we have our networks or\n[40:03] clusters that maybe we have a shared\n[40:05] Kubernetes cluster that both teams need\n[40:07] to land into. That's your landing zone.\n[40:09] So what we need to be able to do is\n[40:11] expose those integration points, right?\n[40:13] So team B needs to be able to read\n[40:15] where's my cluster ID and how do I or\n[40:18] how do I hook up my product repository\n[40:21] so that the Argo CD deployments going\n[40:22] into the right cluster.\n[40:24] >> So you do that so sorry if I I didn't\n[40:25] quite catch the beginning. So you do\n[40:27] that in terraform the the landing zone.\n[40:29] So what I'm I I'm just giving you a\n[40:31] context of like different teams use\n[40:33] using different technologies and the\n[40:35] problem I had was I tried to create an\n[40:38] integration registry and we talked about\n[40:39] this because he says at um at your\n[40:41] organization they use a massive JSON\n[40:43] file that keeps track of the integration\n[40:46] points between different um components.\n[40:50] So everything registers just writes\n[40:52] information out to a JSON file. And I\n[40:54] did similar things like I had AWS CDK\n[40:57] write to SSM parameter store and I had\n[40:59] Terafform read from SSM parameter store\n[41:01] and I had terapform right to SSM\n[41:03] parameter store and AWS CDK reading from\n[41:05] parameter store.\n[41:06] >> Yeah. I prefer the central as I mean\n[41:08] this this in reality has lots of other\n[41:11] fields. Yeah.\n[41:12] >> Yeah. So so the problem with with using\n[41:14] a JSON file you're restricted to a um\n[41:18] usually a a git repository, right?\n[41:20] either you go to a massive monor repo or\n[41:23] uh you do a subm module across all of\n[41:25] the repository so that they have that\n[41:27] JSON file or I don't know how you're\n[41:29] going to get the file in there and\n[41:30] version control it\n[41:32] >> I I kind of re I shouldn't say this on\n[41:34] online but I kind of rewrote something\n[41:36] that we used at work I I mean I didn't\n[41:40] uh steal the code I absolutely wrote it\n[41:42] from scratch using\n[41:44] uh using um\n[41:48] I guess a bit of claude magic So, so\n[41:51] essentially what happens is that we have\n[41:53] an act a reusable action which which\n[41:55] just feeds in the account group or the\n[41:57] the team name\n[41:59] >> and the environment and then out pops\n[42:02] uh\n[42:04] uh things like oh sorry this is me using\n[42:08] the action um\n[42:11] sorry the other repo actually had the\n[42:13] implementation\n[42:18] there's there's an action that basically\n[42:19] just out uh looks up the style the stuff\n[42:23] in the actions JSON.\n[42:26] It's it's nice and fast. It doesn't do\n[42:29] like a full checkout or something weird.\n[42:31] And uh and then just sets the extra\n[42:34] information that that that the um that\n[42:37] the Terraform or whatever your\n[42:39] infrastructure needs like the account,\n[42:41] the region, a key for this, a key for\n[42:44] that.\n[42:45] >> Yeah. The problem there is like you're\n[42:50] you're using a registry and then you\n[42:53] don't know like how stale is that value\n[42:56] and who is consuming the value. That was\n[42:58] my problem. Um [snorts]\n[42:59] >> well I mean if it's centralized the\n[43:01] source of truth is pretty sweet. I mean\n[43:04] >> sure but if it changes how do you\n[43:06] trickle down that change or identify who\n[43:08] needs to be updated? Yeah, this is this\n[43:10] is why I'm going back to this all the\n[43:12] time because I need to know\n[43:15] >> what [snorts] how fresh they are here.\n[43:19] >> Yeah, never mind what's where. I need to\n[43:21] know what version they're running.\n[43:25] >> Um\n[43:26] >> or what version they have viewed or\n[43:28] consumed.\n[43:29] >> Yeah. Like we we in our repos we tag the\n[43:34] this for example and then we kind of\n[43:37] allow them to\n[43:39] tag their deployments or what do you\n[43:41] call it you know use a branch or\n[43:43] whatever to to pin sorry pin was the\n[43:46] word I was looking for but then yeah\n[43:48] they've pinned you know version one here\n[43:50] and like now we're on version five like\n[43:52] how do\n[43:53] >> exactly so so this is also something I\n[43:55] learned about um this version pinning\n[43:58] scenario is that if you start to deal\n[44:00] with these type of deeply nested\n[44:02] structures where you have 40 different\n[44:04] states.\n[44:05] >> Just hold that thought. I got to reply\n[44:07] to my wife.\n[44:12] So the kids need need to go to school. I\n[44:15] think my wife will take them. So yeah.\n[44:18] Yeah. Hold the thought resume.\n[44:21] >> Yeah. So what we were saying is that\n[44:23] version pinning is important,\n[44:25] >> right? and and when you start I started\n[44:28] my career around DevOps with Kubernetes.\n[44:31] So I learned very early that immutable\n[44:33] infrastructure your docker image needs\n[44:35] to be hard you know hard pinned so that\n[44:37] you can do rolling updates because\n[44:39] Kubernetes doesn't allow you to use a\n[44:40] mutable um label. So version pinning is\n[44:43] very important. You want to pin your\n[44:45] docker image. Kubernetes doesn't allow\n[44:47] like uh at latest or whatever the docker\n[44:50] >> condition or officially the way that\n[44:53] Kubernetes is designed is to use\n[44:56] immutable tags and then the way that it\n[44:58] detects that that um a deployment needs\n[45:00] to be rolled is when you change\n[45:02] something right you change the tag and\n[45:05] so it spins up a separate replica\n[45:06] controller starts\n[45:07] >> I didn't realize it enforced it yeah I\n[45:10] know best practice is to use a is to use\n[45:12] >> yeah and there's a lot of workarounds\n[45:14] like keep or ke sorry to basically um\n[45:18] track um you know a docker hub image\n[45:21] repository and identify if a new um\n[45:24] metadata if a new checksum has been\n[45:25] pushed for a certain latest tag and then\n[45:28] automatically trigger a rolling update\n[45:30] but then you have to work around it by\n[45:31] by changing the labels and then it will\n[45:34] start rolling out pods with new labels\n[45:36] those are all workarounds the original\n[45:38] design of Kubernetes is very simple your\n[45:40] image tag is what determines the version\n[45:42] that runs so you cannot use a mutable\n[45:45] tag. You have to specify which version\n[45:47] you want to run and if you want to\n[45:49] update it, you change Kubernetes\n[45:51] manifests. What what helps you update\n[45:53] them? Sorry. Like how do you what's the\n[45:55] workflow for people like do they get\n[45:58] like a dependabot like oh you need to to\n[46:00] bump.\n[46:01] >> Yeah. So we're we're going back to the\n[46:02] point that the design when you start\n[46:04] with Kubernetes and Docker and immutable\n[46:06] infrastructure is that version pinning\n[46:07] is very important, right? And and as you\n[46:09] just highlighted also when you get a lot\n[46:11] of different states and a new version\n[46:13] has been published but um you have all\n[46:15] of these um you know very niche um\n[46:18] little states that haven't been touched\n[46:20] for a long time and they're still on\n[46:21] version one right and now you and then\n[46:23] for example you have a big um\n[46:25] organizationwide initiative that you\n[46:27] need to upgrade the provider and then\n[46:29] you find out that some really deep uh\n[46:31] nested areas are still using a very old\n[46:34] version and now they suddenly have to go\n[46:35] all the way to production and they're\n[46:37] like\n[46:39] the answer. I [laughter] need to know\n[46:40] the answer. How you keep\n[46:42] >> So, so funny funny enough. Funny enough,\n[46:45] uh, one of my previous colleagues, he\n[46:47] just got rid of all of the versioning.\n[46:48] He trunk based just\n[46:51] >> Well, this is this is what I like to do\n[46:53] in a in a sense. Just tell everyone you\n[46:55] got to use latest.\n[46:56] >> See you.\n[46:59] >> Yeah. Latest or at stable or something\n[47:02] or there's probably some other type,\n[47:03] >> right? And but if you're in a monor repo\n[47:05] and and you're you're running off git,\n[47:08] you just point to head, right? So so\n[47:10] when you run your IC for example and it\n[47:12] checks out the repository and it it gets\n[47:15] head and so it gets all the latest\n[47:18] version of your modules together with\n[47:20] head of your um because like imagine\n[47:22] that you have a infrastructure mono and\n[47:25] you have a GitHub action or Atlantis\n[47:26] running to to do your IC terapform plan\n[47:29] apply. So the first thing it does on\n[47:31] your branch or of master it will check\n[47:34] out the repo and it will take head right\n[47:36] and then instead of version pinning\n[47:38] every single module which is the\n[47:40] recommended right way to do instead of\n[47:42] version pinning any every module you\n[47:45] point everything relatively within the\n[47:47] repo to your current like head.\n[47:51] >> Got it.\n[47:51] >> Right. Which is trunk based development.\n[47:53] Right.\n[47:53] >> Right. And at that point that means\n[47:55] every single change you make to a module\n[47:57] automatically gets procreated across\n[47:59] your whole infrastructure.\n[48:00] >> Yeah, that means but that means you have\n[48:02] to deploy in a in a with some rigor some\n[48:05] schedule, right?\n[48:06] >> No, you you have to use feature flags\n[48:09] and you have to release features like\n[48:11] for example if you're going to so this\n[48:13] is what we do at my organization right\n[48:15] now. We we have gotten rid of all the\n[48:17] modules.\n[48:19] So trunk based trunkbased infrastructure\n[48:22] with feature facts.\n[48:24] >> Absolutely.\n[48:27] I did a a presentation about that other\n[48:30] conference.\n[48:30] >> This is something that Thoughtworks\n[48:32] preaches for software development, but\n[48:34] for some reason I never thought about\n[48:36] this in the context of infrastructure.\n[48:40] >> Yeah. So it's it's it's the same thing.\n[48:44] The first thing you have to do is you\n[48:46] point all of you get rid of all the\n[48:47] module versions. you point to the\n[48:50] relative path or you make sure that\n[48:51] you're always checking out the latest\n[48:53] version of the modules, right? And then\n[48:55] when you run your Terraform plan, of\n[48:57] course, you have to control how those\n[48:59] features get rolled out, right? So the\n[49:01] best way to control how features get\n[49:03] rolled out across your infrastructure is\n[49:04] by putting in feature flags, right?\n[49:07] >> So we're adding a new, for example,\n[49:08] we're adding a new we're doing a\n[49:10] database migration. I'm changing my\n[49:12] module to to provision the new database\n[49:15] as well as keep the old database\n[49:17] instance running and it's behind a\n[49:18] feature flag. So when this gets applied\n[49:21] into dev, it's going to spin up a new\n[49:23] database. It's still going to have the\n[49:24] old database there and we're going to\n[49:26] start pointing our customers um to the\n[49:28] new one, our client to the new one. If\n[49:30] we're doing this with a cut over, uh we\n[49:32] obviously need\n[49:33] >> How do you do this with Terraform? But\n[49:34] carry on.\n[49:36] [clears throat]\n[49:36] >> It's very simple on your module. You\n[49:38] just put a variable that that um sets\n[49:40] migration enabled true and in production\n[49:42] is disabled and then you have another\n[49:45] variable that says uh delete the old\n[49:46] database and then you you you toggle the\n[49:50] the flags as you are getting confident\n[49:52] you have the same code running in depth\n[49:53] you have tested it then you're going\n[49:55] into staging you've tested the cut over\n[49:57] everything then you ready go to prod\n[49:59] you're doing the first flag on the new\n[50:00] database gets created you re reconfigure\n[50:03] your clients you turn on the second flag\n[50:05] the old database gets deleted your cut\n[50:07] over is done and then you go back to\n[50:09] your module, you delete folds variables\n[50:11] and across your real estate everything\n[50:12] is replanned with the latest version of\n[50:14] that module and it works because you've\n[50:17] tested it everywhere, right? Your your\n[50:19] module is immediately planned everywhere\n[50:21] and it shouldn't show you any diff when\n[50:23] you remove them. So, it's feature flag\n[50:25] development, you know, with u\n[50:26] >> I've never heard of this in all honesty.\n[50:28] I thought I've never seen\n[50:29] >> I do that with Atlantis only. Um um at\n[50:33] >> does Atlantis have some some sort of\n[50:35] support for feature flags.\n[50:38] >> No, but I basically just do an enable\n[50:41] auto plan and I automatically I have\n[50:43] Atlantis project detection integrated\n[50:46] within my repo bootstrapper. So when I\n[50:49] set up my repository, it automatically\n[50:51] generates the configuration for every\n[50:52] single directory for Atlantis to figure\n[50:54] out whenever this module changes, you\n[50:56] need to replan all of the states that\n[50:59] depend on that module. And so whenever\n[51:01] anyone makes a change to a module, it's\n[51:03] immediately tested everywhere. Like if\n[51:05] it's going to have an impact on pro,\n[51:06] that PR is immediately blocked because\n[51:08] you haven't put in a feature flag on the\n[51:10] variable. So you need to set up a\n[51:11] variable to make sure that it's by\n[51:13] default acting like originally and then\n[51:15] you go and update the call sites where\n[51:16] you want this feature to be deployed and\n[51:18] then you set now enable it here and then\n[51:20] you test it in dev. It's okay. Then we\n[51:22] can go um and and and push this module.\n[51:25] We can get the PR merged because then we\n[51:28] do multiple PRs to roll it across our\n[51:30] environments and that way we don't have\n[51:32] like some really old state using a\n[51:34] really old module. We always have\n[51:36] everything on head.\n[51:38] >> That's the goal.\n[51:39] >> Yeah.\n[51:40] >> Yeah. Yeah, I like that a lot. Wow.\n[51:43] >> Wow.\n[51:44] >> And so\n[51:45] >> the requirement is to have the\n[51:47] capability to define what is the\n[51:49] dependency or which modules a state\n[51:52] depends on. Is it if you don't do that\n[51:54] right, you're back to your original\n[51:55] situation where everything is version\n[51:57] pint and then now you could discover\n[51:59] that one particular team is still using\n[52:01] version 1.0 and if you're doing sambar,\n[52:04] right, you're on version 2.0 means that\n[52:06] you have a breaking change, right? So\n[52:09] they have to\n[52:10] don't I mean or\n[52:12] >> or uses it as an excuse to break an API\n[52:15] which is\n[52:16] >> yeah but I'm I'm so I'm doing that\n[52:18] turnbased development on my IC with\n[52:20] feature flex but I am still every single\n[52:23] time doing sar on my modules because I'm\n[52:26] snapshotting the module version in case\n[52:28] anything happens I can always pin it so\n[52:30] this is something that happens sometimes\n[52:32] is this module this change is\n[52:35] significant and it's we can't just put\n[52:38] it behind a feature flag because that's\n[52:39] the the the the flip side of feature\n[52:42] flags, right? You cannot control the\n[52:44] interaction of the flags if you have so\n[52:46] many flags on them. So, at some point um\n[52:48] the risk is that maybe one team is\n[52:51] adding a variable for their use case and\n[52:53] other teams another variable and how do\n[52:54] those interact with each other? You\n[52:56] don't know how they interact with each\n[52:57] other. So, it's nice to say like, oh, we\n[52:59] know all of the possible configurations\n[53:00] of the feature flags together. We know\n[53:02] that it's going to work. we don't if we\n[53:04] don't clean up feature frags and if we\n[53:06] if we are not careful we we have other\n[53:08] complexities to deal with. Um\n[53:10] >> yeah so it's not it's not there's no\n[53:12] silver bullet of course I think I know\n[53:14] what you mean there like [laughter]\n[53:15] clean yeah like then you have you know\n[53:17] new problem uh\n[53:18] >> so so every single module change comes\n[53:21] with a server like change log and an\n[53:24] actual snapshot of that module pushed\n[53:26] into an S3 bucket. So if we need for\n[53:29] whatever reason we can pin a module but\n[53:33] it's highly discouraged if you do like\n[53:35] >> if you do go ahead and pin it then I set\n[53:39] up um a scheduled action that that\n[53:42] detects any states that have a pinned\n[53:45] module and then it goes and uh tries to\n[53:47] unpin it and creates a PR to unpin it\n[53:49] and then the idea is that we need to get\n[53:52] those PRs merged as soon as possible to\n[53:53] basically unpin the modules otherwise\n[53:55] these particular states will start to\n[53:57] back behind and become more of a\n[53:58] headache and lead you down yak shaving\n[54:01] paths down the line. Right. [snorts] Um,\n[54:03] >> cool, man. Thanks. Thanks for all that\n[54:06] wisdom, man.\n[54:08] >> But that all works if you're in a monor\n[54:10] repo, right? Um\n[54:12] >> and and and and then the other\n[54:13] alternative actually to just this week\n[54:17] config hub it was announced like last\n[54:19] week but this week they they did an IT\n[54:21] next article where they go into details\n[54:23] about the problem of YAML manifest and\n[54:26] Argo CD. They're basically highlighting\n[54:28] how a lot of people are abusing Argo CCD\n[54:31] uh with Helm to you know in memory on\n[54:34] the Kubernetes cluster um expand all of\n[54:36] the YAML manifests and then fire it off\n[54:38] at the Kubernetes cluster and then they\n[54:40] have no idea what's happening. Um so\n[54:42] they are they're introducing the concept\n[54:44] of um infrastructure as data. No\n[54:47] configuration as data. C A yeah it's CA\n[54:50] A and\n[54:53] I really still don't know exactly how\n[54:55] their platform but their platform.\n[54:58] Yes. Uh oh there's another one Napio but\n[55:04] there's one from\n[55:06] today. It's definitely it's Brian Grant\n[55:08] startup. There's a one that was posted\n[55:11] like like maybe 12 hours ago from config\n[55:15] hub where they go into the problems and\n[55:18] the solution of configuration as data.\n[55:20] Um and in in the problems they are\n[55:23] highlighting like the ren the renovate\n[55:25] bot approach. So if you version pin your\n[55:27] modules or version pin your helm charts\n[55:29] then you set up something like renovate\n[55:31] to automatically create pull requests to\n[55:33] update your things.\n[55:35] >> Yeah. I mean actually at my workplace\n[55:37] they've written a beautiful like 100\n[55:39] line uh Python script and what it does\n[55:43] it's it's called distribute py and you\n[55:47] you can have a config to say like you\n[55:49] want these paths pushed to these repos\n[55:51] or even I think even it supports like\n[55:54] hierarchy. So, so basically like if if\n[55:58] they want to make sure that every team\n[56:00] in dev has this new config set, they\n[56:03] push it out or a new file in their in\n[56:05] their repos, they just push it out\n[56:08] >> so that everyone has a new workflow that\n[56:10] they they they can use or the or their\n[56:13] workflow in their in their repos.\n[56:15] Actually, this is what this thing is\n[56:16] missing repositories.\n[56:19] >> Yeah. All of that mapped across repos.\n[56:21] But like uh I guess the repro would sit\n[56:24] here but like yeah it it pushes it out\n[56:27] and they do this and they said like I\n[56:29] said like wow I've never seen this\n[56:30] before. So you didn't want to get the\n[56:32] pendot like a like a pullbase flow going\n[56:34] like he says no pullbase will not work\n[56:36] in our organization. We need a push we\n[56:39] need to be fast and it needs to be\n[56:40] updated like immediately\n[56:42] >> and I was like wow I've never seen that\n[56:44] before.\n[56:45] >> When they say push do they do do they go\n[56:47] and create pull requests in the other on\n[56:49] the other ones? Direct commit.\n[56:51] >> Direct commit. Yeah, they have like a\n[56:54] bot and it just like just overwrites\n[56:56] whatever they have.\n[56:58] >> So, this is my biggest issue with all of\n[57:00] these like cookie cutter and\n[57:01] bootstrappers. Most of them they do a\n[57:03] onetime bootstrap and they never\n[57:05] consider the the day to\n[57:08] I created an issue about this in GitHub.\n[57:10] Um, let me see if I can\n[57:11] >> Oh, forget about GitHub template repos.\n[57:13] I hate them. Every time I see somebody\n[57:15] use them, I I just immediately want to\n[57:17] shut that down. It's like don't don't\n[57:20] >> um yeah like here's my question here. Hi\n[57:22] there. How do you should a repository be\n[57:24] generated from a template keep up to\n[57:26] date with an evolving template?\n[57:29] >> Yeah,\n[57:30] >> it says GitHub templates are designed\n[57:32] for onetime scaffolding.\n[57:36] Yeah. So\n[57:37] >> I created a worm in my previous\n[57:39] organization.\n[57:41] >> So what do you mean to update stuff?\n[57:45] >> Yeah. So whenever I created a PR on my\n[57:47] on my template repo, it would\n[57:49] automatically create commits in my other\n[57:52] repositories to pull it in to the to\n[57:54] pull in the diff from that PR. Uh except\n[57:57] that it would copy to itself and then\n[57:59] trigger itself. And I had to like\n[58:01] explicitly allow uh GitHub action\n[58:03] workflows to trigger themsel. And then I\n[58:06] I I created like 70 plus emails per\n[58:09] minute across the whole email system.\n[58:11] And then my C after like half a day my\n[58:14] my CTO sent me a message like what's\n[58:17] happening? [laughter]\n[58:17] >> What what do you mean you're sending\n[58:19] emails to different people?\n[58:21] >> Yeah.\n[58:22] >> No, because GitHub action run started\n[58:24] like failing and sending emails like the\n[58:26] the run failed and so I was literally\n[58:28] spend three hours killing killing action\n[58:31] runs.\n[58:31] >> Uh [laughter]\n[58:33] it was a lot of fun. So I I had this\n[58:35] idea as well like originally with with\n[58:37] template repos maybe like five years ago\n[58:39] to to automate this push down to all of\n[58:42] the repos that all.\n[58:43] >> So I I I mean in all in all honesty at\n[58:46] this particular client I think the push\n[58:47] mechanism works quite well because you\n[58:50] know the relationship they have with the\n[58:51] teams like\n[58:52] >> you know like these are data teams they\n[58:54] don't know what they're doing. They need\n[58:56] this thing up to date now.\n[58:58] >> And then the other thing is the moment I\n[59:00] started using progen projen.io IO which\n[59:03] is popular within the AWS CDK ecosystem.\n[59:06] Um, Proen.io\n[59:08] uh is kind of like the Pandaot. When you\n[59:11] bootstrap a repository with with this\n[59:13] tool, it sets up an update uh scheduled\n[59:16] update uh system. So you can define like\n[59:18] once a week, daily, and you can also set\n[59:20] up automerge and all that. and and and\n[59:23] so what it does is it it runs the it it\n[59:26] downloads the latest version of the\n[59:27] template and it runs it and it basically\n[59:30] mod like selfmutates and and keeps the\n[59:33] repo up to date and then automerges. So\n[59:35] it's pool based but it happens\n[59:37] automatically\n[59:37] >> but like but\n[59:40] I I'm not too sure how we got here. We\n[59:42] were talking about uh configuration\n[59:44] >> unpinning and pushing.\n[59:45] >> I'm actually not sure dependabot is a\n[59:47] very scalable solution. Um well it\n[59:51] >> uh so one thing I don't like about\n[59:53] dependabot is that it creates so many\n[59:54] PRs and and that's why I usually\n[59:56] disabled it but you can actually set up\n[59:59] grouping.\n[1:00:00] >> Yeah I know there was one repository\n[1:00:02] where I think I set up auto like\n[1:00:06] >> auto actually how did I do that again?\n[1:00:10] Uh oh,\n[1:00:11] >> you have to create a a GitHub token for\n[1:00:14] an automerge uh bot to to\n[1:00:17] >> I'm not too sure how I can find my own\n[1:00:19] automerge. What What should I search\n[1:00:20] for? H PR\n[1:00:22] >> I use dependabots with um release please\n[1:00:25] and automerge on my Golang CLI for\n[1:00:28] Terraform. It's a public repo. You want\n[1:00:30] to see it?\n[1:00:31] >> Um okay. If you Well, I mean I've done\n[1:00:34] it before. I just can't remember where I\n[1:00:35] done it.\n[1:00:36] >> Yeah.\n[1:00:37] >> Okay. The problem um with dependabot is\n[1:00:41] originally my biggest issue was all of\n[1:00:43] the different PRs but you can set up\n[1:00:45] grouping rules. You can say like for\n[1:00:47] this buckets manager you group all the\n[1:00:48] PRs um instead of creating like five PRs\n[1:00:51] you create one for go dependencies for\n[1:00:53] example and and then you set up the\n[1:00:56] >> the question remains like you can't\n[1:00:58] expect all these different teams to\n[1:01:00] basically\n[1:01:03] >> merge the PRs and that's where things\n[1:01:06] really That's why I don't think that\n[1:01:08] what you mentioned earlier about the\n[1:01:09] push flow is automatically committing to\n[1:01:11] master. I think what it's doing is it's\n[1:01:13] creating a branch. It's creating a PR.\n[1:01:15] It's it ts it with a label and then it\n[1:01:18] said it's pushing it straight to main.\n[1:01:19] They usually updating workflows. They\n[1:01:22] only usually do it for updating\n[1:01:24] workflows.\n[1:01:25] >> I think it's either it's pull or push.\n[1:01:27] It doesn't really matter much. Um, but I\n[1:01:29] have the same flow which it just creates\n[1:01:32] u a PR that the PR is labeled as\n[1:01:34] automerge and then you have an automerge\n[1:01:36] bot that will auto approve actually\n[1:01:38] sorry the PR is labeled as auto approve\n[1:01:41] and then that bot will auto approve\n[1:01:43] those PRs and then it will enable the\n[1:01:46] automerge as soon as the checks pass. So\n[1:01:48] I will never merge or commit straight to\n[1:01:50] master.\n[1:01:50] >> That's quite a complex setup but I guess\n[1:01:52] it's\n[1:01:53] >> I mean let me share my screen and I'll\n[1:01:55] show you the repository. It is a public\n[1:01:58] report.\n[1:02:00] Uh\n[1:02:03] oh, not what I\n[1:02:05] >> is requesting you to allow multiple\n[1:02:07] presenters to share. Okay, whatever.\n[1:02:10] >> Okay, I'm sharing.\n[1:02:13] Which one am I sharing? This one. I\n[1:02:16] guess\n[1:02:16] >> I think we got to wind up in a couple of\n[1:02:18] minutes just because I've got I got so\n[1:02:20] much work today. Oh my god.\n[1:02:22] >> And we never talked about we never\n[1:02:23] talked about AI. Oh god.\n[1:02:25] >> [snorts]\n[1:02:26] >> So here I have this Golang binary. It's\n[1:02:29] a fork from\n[1:02:30] >> Are you sharing? I can't see it.\n[1:02:31] >> Oh, sorry. You can see it now.\n[1:02:34] >> Yeah, I can see it now.\n[1:02:35] >> Maybe let me drag it out of all these\n[1:02:37] tabs so it's a bit less confusing. So um\n[1:02:40] I forked this from the Chan Zuckerberg\n[1:02:43] Foundation, the wife of um some Facebook\n[1:02:46] dude. I don't know.\n[1:02:47] >> Yeah, I don't know.\n[1:02:48] >> And they create they have a um\n[1:02:51] >> Oh, do do quick sign up. Do you know um\n[1:02:54] Swix? Uh what's his real name? He's\n[1:02:57] Singaporean guy.\n[1:02:59] >> No, I mean you met him.\n[1:03:01] >> Um I forgot his real name. I just call\n[1:03:03] him by his uh his handle. He did an\n[1:03:06] interview with Mark Zuckerberg like last\n[1:03:08] week.\n[1:03:09] >> Oh, nice.\n[1:03:10] >> Um so you know, one one connection away.\n[1:03:14] Okay. Yeah. Carry on.\n[1:03:16] So, so this is a nonprofit that uses\n[1:03:20] Terraform to bootstrap some of the\n[1:03:22] services that they use and they have a\n[1:03:24] very uh they have a lot of tooling there\n[1:03:27] uh some of Golang like tooling and this\n[1:03:30] one is a very opinionated Terraform\n[1:03:32] bootstrapper. Um, the reason I like it\n[1:03:34] is because after using Terra Grant,\n[1:03:36] having all of your different Terraform\n[1:03:39] state configurations spread across the\n[1:03:41] repo, it was very hard to keep track of\n[1:03:43] like exactly how things were organized.\n[1:03:46] And so this uses a central manifest, a\n[1:03:48] central YAML file that basically defines\n[1:03:50] the layout of the repository. Um the\n[1:03:53] idea is that this gets used across\n[1:03:55] product repos so that every every team\n[1:03:57] is basically bootstrapping terraform the\n[1:03:59] same way and then you can update the\n[1:04:01] templates and then every team updates\n[1:04:02] their fog version and then it updates\n[1:04:04] the repository across right. Um I'm\n[1:04:07] using it in a monor repo way which is\n[1:04:08] not really the intended design. So I\n[1:04:11] added features to like distribute the\n[1:04:13] config file. So I ended up with kind of\n[1:04:15] like an in between. Um but yeah, I I\n[1:04:18] basically forked it and I've been adding\n[1:04:20] a lot of features. But what we're\n[1:04:21] talking about is how do the releases\n[1:04:23] happen here, right? So in this case, I\n[1:04:26] also have this uh dependabot\n[1:04:27] configuration to automatically update my\n[1:04:30] go dependencies and it doesn't directly\n[1:04:33] merge I mean it doesn't commit to\n[1:04:35] master, right? It creates a different PR\n[1:04:38] and it does a terapform group as you\n[1:04:39] see, right? It groups all of the\n[1:04:41] dependencies that are related to\n[1:04:42] Terraform uh modules and groups them all\n[1:04:45] into one place. So it picks up like um\n[1:04:47] we're getting the latest go-getter uh\n[1:04:49] and if there's another module that is\n[1:04:51] related to the terapform group, it will\n[1:04:52] be part of this PR and then what happens\n[1:04:54] is it automatically lets adds the bot\n[1:04:57] merge label and that gets auto approved\n[1:05:00] but it's using my pat so it's showing me\n[1:05:02] as the approver so it's using my GitHub\n[1:05:04] token to approve this and as soon as all\n[1:05:06] of the the the CI/CD passes on the pull\n[1:05:09] request only then does it merge right\n[1:05:11] it's it enables automerge and when\n[1:05:14] everything like see it enables automerge\n[1:05:16] And when all is good and all the tests\n[1:05:18] pass, then it gets merged. So you get a\n[1:05:20] very controlled way of of deploying.\n[1:05:22] >> Your profile looks like the opposite of\n[1:05:23] my profile in GitHub. That's weird. Like\n[1:05:25] I'm looking one direction, you're\n[1:05:27] looking the other direction.\n[1:05:29] >> This is Scarface, right?\n[1:05:31] >> Oh, that's not you.\n[1:05:32] >> Not me. [laughter]\n[1:05:36] >> Yeah. Um, so so that I like this. I like\n[1:05:39] this a lot. And what happens is all of\n[1:05:41] these u dependency updates get merged\n[1:05:43] onto master and then Google release\n[1:05:46] please keeps track of them and basically\n[1:05:49] tells me the next release that's going\n[1:05:51] to happen is going to include all of\n[1:05:52] these bumps.\n[1:05:53] >> But have have you used this in anger? I\n[1:05:54] mean have you used this with several\n[1:05:56] teams? I'm just wondering if this is\n[1:05:59] going to work.\n[1:05:59] >> So we use this CLI across our Terraform\n[1:06:02] repos but they're large. So we have like\n[1:06:04] two or three of them and basically fog\n[1:06:07] is dictating the the the layout of the\n[1:06:10] terraform repo and integrating with\n[1:06:12] Atlantis and also now integrating with\n[1:06:14] Terra constructs. So it's bootstrapping\n[1:06:15] TypeScript projects, it's setting up the\n[1:06:17] TS config, it's setting up ES linting\n[1:06:19] rules, everything. So so all of those\n[1:06:21] templates are inside fog and I I still I\n[1:06:24] don't recommend it because uh we're\n[1:06:26] using it and it's working for us but\n[1:06:29] some people might not really like some\n[1:06:30] of the things it does, right? Um but\n[1:06:32] yeah it does the full repo remote and it\n[1:06:34] controls some part of what the grid will\n[1:06:37] do. It controls how these components\n[1:06:38] link to each other. So it determines\n[1:06:40] what is the remote state for that\n[1:06:41] component. So if you have a landing zone\n[1:06:43] component and you have a cluster\n[1:06:44] component and the cluster needs to to\n[1:06:46] understand where is the network created\n[1:06:48] by the landing zone then it will read\n[1:06:50] those outputs from each other. So that's\n[1:06:52] through the remote state right so so\n[1:06:54] it's a very opinionated way again\n[1:06:55] originally from from Chan Zuckerberg but\n[1:06:58] I added a lot of features on top of\n[1:07:00] that.\n[1:07:00] >> That's interesting. That's really\n[1:07:00] interesting. Nonetheless, I think I\n[1:07:03] think in in my current gig, the\n[1:07:06] the different teams are not really\n[1:07:08] owning the infrastructure. So, I don't\n[1:07:10] need them to do a lot of complexity. I\n[1:07:13] just need them to do the data type\n[1:07:16] stuff. And I think I can control that\n[1:07:18] better not using this. But I don't know.\n[1:07:21] This is really interesting. But, okay, I\n[1:07:23] got to wind up here because I got to I\n[1:07:25] got to go go straight into into work\n[1:07:27] mode.\n[1:07:29] >> Okay. Great talking with you. Um,\n[1:07:31] unfortunately we didn't talk anything\n[1:07:33] about AI.\n[1:07:34] I don't know, maybe maybe another\n[1:07:36] morning we can I can do the same thing.\n[1:07:38] Just let me know.\n[1:07:39] >> [ __ ] Actually, I I I found out remember\n[1:07:42] yesterday we talked and I said that\n[1:07:44] there's um I was doing like a quick\n[1:07:46] dashboard because I'm using beats to\n[1:07:47] track issues for the LLM.\n[1:07:49] >> Yeah, you showed me. That was great.\n[1:07:50] Yeah.\n[1:07:51] >> But there are actually like six or seven\n[1:07:53] people doing the same thing.\n[1:07:55] >> That's the beauty of AI, isn't it? It's\n[1:07:57] so beautiful.\n[1:07:58] >> Yeah. So, so I found some u kind of\n[1:08:01] working dashboard and it's pretty neat.\n[1:08:02] It gives you like a full overview of\n[1:08:05] your large features and your\n[1:08:06] >> epics. Let's pick up on that next. Don't\n[1:08:08] no more talking about infrastructure\n[1:08:10] full AI next talk. Okay.\n[1:08:13] >> And uh I'm happy to wake up in the\n[1:08:15] morning. Just let me know what day suits\n[1:08:16] you.\n[1:08:17] >> Yeah, sounds good.\n[1:08:19] >> Could be could even be tomorrow. I don't\n[1:08:20] I don't mind. See you.\n[1:08:22] >> Sounds good. Yep. See you. Bye.",

Could be at least 10 days, I\nthink.\n>> Yeah. I wanted to start by asking you a\ncouple of questions. Maybe\nan info um let I mean, we're both\ninfrastructure engineers, so I have an\ninfrastructure question for you.\n>> Okay. So this is a wonderful GitHub\naccount of this person here.\n>> I was just trying to\n>> so imagine there's like an AWS landscape\nlike this where where where the fruits\nhere are basically different teams,\nright?\n>> Yeah. So the so some teams have a dev\naccount, some some have a some have the\nwhole you know the whole shebang.\nUm and actually this is not even\naccurate like sometimes they can have\ndeployments in different regions right\ncould be U1\n>> I should have sorry this is not the best\nexample but you know I was I had to be\nquick about it. [snorts] Um so so each\nteam like potentially has\nhas a a number of deployments so we say\nright I think that's the the correct\nterminology because they could have a\ndeployment in USC East1 Singapore\nsame account\ndifferent environments and each\nenvironment is mapped to an account.\nYeah. So the my question is is that like\nI have a landscape like this in a in a\nbig company to manage and often enough\nI'm like you know does team Mango have\nstuff in this region and like I don't\nknow. Um but it's even worse. I mean if\nI had this uh up to date Jason JSON I\nprobably could easily quickly answer\nyeah okay they should have stuff in new\neast one\n>> but the trouble is that sometimes it's\nit's up to the different teams to deploy\ntheir own infrastructure so it's like\nthen again I don't even know if they've\nactually really done deployments you\nknow what I mean it's like so as a\nplatform engineer I have to like sort of\nkeep an eye on what people are doing but\nit's very difficult for me to keep it so\nI thought to myself this example is one\nI struggle with on a daily basis. Does\nTacos or your tool or I guess I mean\nTerraform Cloud will probably be the\ngreatest tool for this but like how do I\ntrack?\n>> Yeah. So with with the grid what I I do\nand I think other tools uh like Terra\nTeam or Digger or Spaceelift they also\nhave the concept of labels. So teams can\nattach labels to states and you can\ntrack if um if they are having states\nfor resources inside a certain region.\nNow the problem could be if you are\ndoing multi-reional\nterraform right if you could if you have\none state that creates um for example\nVPC peering between two regions and then\ncreates the end points on one side and\nthen does the\n>> that's a very good example that that\nthat's a kind of like special case I was\ngoing to talk about next\n>> but at the moment we've gone um yeah the\nstate file is separated per region yeah\n>> which makes sense and another thing\nbefore you start with\nuh in my previous organizations we also\nhad the first question we ask do we\norganize by team then by by by stage. So\nfor example in this case you have team\nApple has stages dev pro and u or do we\ngo by stage and then by team because um\ndo you first have like dev pro stage and\nthen within dev you have team A, team B,\nteam C and then within stage you have\nteam A. We had we had a I mean the\nprevious incarnation of of this cloud\ndeployment on the on this particular\nclient they had they had it whereby\nthere was like one dev account and all\nthe teams were on it\n>> but we the people were stepping on each\nother's toes all the time.\n>> It's not necessarily like with well the\nproblem we were facing is from a dev sec\nops perspective the rules that apply to\nnon-production uh stages are different\nfrom production. It's easier if you're\nin AWS or manager to basically define\nyour um what's it called like the units\nor the organizational units or use on\nthe stages level so that we could apply\nsecurity policies on the stages level.\nOh, you mean like stages as in these\nenvironments?\n>> Oh, use. Yeah, we have nested to use in\nin AWS or right. So, we decided that it\nwould make more sense because we are\nattaching our organization.\n>> I never thought about that. I never\nthought about that. That's a that's a\nbloody good idea actually. What? I've\nnever done that before now. So, yeah.\nSo, you have a tree.\nUh how do I share that with you? where\nwe had a discussion between the platform\nteam lead and the dev sec ops team and\nthen how do we set up our OUS and how do\nwe manage our security policies in our\nAWS and we had an existing setup where\nwe had like team A, team B, team C and\nthen we had dev staging and prod under\nthe teams and we switched it over to the\nother way because we wanted to manage\nour policies that way.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Um\ndid so did AWS support you? No, not\nreally.\n>> With AWS OUS, uh they can be like\nnested, right? And you can attach\npolicies to the OU. So you can attach\nthe non-prod policies to the nonpro OUS\nand then all of the teams operate within\nthose and then when you go to prod,\nthere's more guard rails and and\nsecurity.\n>> So yeah, I see what you're saying. So\nthe policies\napply on top level top level I'm not\nsure that's the right term stage.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then and then that trickles down.\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. Why\nhaven't I done that? I feel dumb for not\nhaving even done that.\n>> I mean because you came from an\nenvironment where they were sharing an\naccount and it was causing issues. But\nAWS is actually at some point I read\nthis book from uh like microservices\nfrom Sam Newman I think and he was like\nsaying in the book how AWS even goes so\nfar as to give every environment an\naccount. So that you know like team A\nprod has one AWS account and team B prod\nhas a separate AWS account. Uh actually\neven worse like team A has two services\nFU and bar and then team A FU stage goes\ninto one account and team uh A bar stage\ngoes into another account which is like\nso you need to do all of the peering and\nlike you know you can only connect uh or\ncommunicate across account boundaries\nwhich is crazy from like from a small\nstartup's perspective to to be to have\nto have all of this AWS account\nmanagement overhead right [snorts] um\nAnother thing is what we wanted was the\nability to\num\n[clears throat] vent an AWS account for\na team for a limited amount of time\n>> and then once they were done with it\nlike return it to a pool. So we wanted\non demand account creation.\n>> You return it to a pool then you just\ndestroy it.\n>> Well that's the thing. Originally AWS\ndidn't have a lot of AWS uh a lot of API\nfor account management. So destroying an\naccount was very difficult.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I see what you're saying.\n>> So, so the idea is to run\n>> I made a video about that.\n>> Yeah. So, the idea is is to run like\nnukes and and and basically have a pool\nof accounts and and cycle through them.\nUh which is a lot easier and there's a\nlot of tools to do that.\n>> Do you so you've used AWS Nuke? I think\nit changed.\n>> Uh there's two of them. I think I use\nthe other like there's one from Terra\nGrant which is very popular or um not\nTerra Grant but the Grunt Works nuke uh\nthat has been forked. I don't I don't\nthink I liked\n>> you.\n>> Yeah, I think the fork was better and\nthere's the grunt work one wasn't good.\nThere's a cl there's a cloud nuke uh\nthat supports multiploud. I I remember\ngoing through all of them and only one\nof them was really wellmaintained and\nand well structured.\n>> This is the one that is used in my\nemployer if I remember correctly.\nI have one in my repo as well like it's\nset up in lift and shift because I have\ntags which is like uh nuke don't destroy\nyou can put a tag so it's 100% not going\nto destroy some resources so I have\n>> ah I I have cloud nuke and I have AWS\nnuke which one am I using\n>> initial p was done with cloud nuke which\nwas a best practice from terror test for\ncleaning up but it was really bad and so\nthen I used reby AWS nuke which worked a\nlot\nUm, and then Ericson AWS Nuke. Yes. So\nChristristen AWS Nuke is a fork from the\noriginal Dby.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I'm I'm a big fan of uh nuking uh\naccounts or thermal environments. I made\na video about that again.\n>> Big fan.\n>> Yeah. So Okay. So what I'm Okay.\nOkay. You you told me about this uh\nstage level. Um\n>> Yeah. U organization. That's cool. I\ndidn't uh think about that for some\nreason or wasn't exposed to that. But\nbut still the question remains how how\ndo you how do I mean if I mean this is\ngoing to be duplicated on each stage. Um\nand then and then of course I mean let's\njust be a little bit explicit then then\nthen again this is going to be you know\nAP southeast one or something crazy\nu east one they're going to have\ndifferent resources in different regions\nUS uh EU west two or something and then\nand then just to make things even extra\nspicy I'm not too sure if it's worth is\nit worth putting it here yeah it is\nbecause things are split by region. Like\nfor example, they have a they use a\ndatabase vendor. I'm not going to tell\nthe name of the vendor, but the vendor\nitself has has this notion of uh\ndifferent sites. So you can have like a\nLondon site\nand uh I don't know an island site\nand things on their AP southeast.\n>> Yeah. So So um okay, let's just put over\nthere. So, so\nyeah, it doesn't make sense there. It\nshould be over there. I can't get over\nthere very easy. Well, let me just US\none or something. So what I'm trying to\nsay here is that like I I think\nhopefully you see the pain is like at\nthe moment like do we separate the state\nby you know this uh path\nor do we clump the state together even\nthough the database is actually designed\n>> uh potentially to be separate actually\n>> because it's like a backup\n>> and like I'm just like my head is\nturning like just tracking this is\nmaking my head spin. Never mind uh you\nknow uh\nthe other aspects of operating this plat\nthis platform.\nYeah. I mean I think the easy way\nforward always and this is why I think\ninfrastructure as code and really being\nable to to treat infrastructure as code\num it involves things like refactoring,\nright? So I think we should just go\nforward with merged like dry\n>> yagny you ain't going to need it type of\napproach merging everything.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then and then at the point that that\nit's like oh actually we're facing\nissues because of contention on the\nlocks state locks or whatever or because\nof um the terapform plan takes too long\nor whatever at that point there then\nrefactoring needs to be uh done. So of\ncourse we need to have like a road map\nand a target And it's such a pain. It's\nsuch a pain to refactor cuz we we have\nlike kind of like teams bothering us all\nthe time saying no you can't change this\nor like you know this is going to be\ndisruptive.\n>> Uh I mean uh I mean it's not that\ndisruptive but like just\n>> getting uh you know some of these\naccount uh some of these state files are\nso like high security that it's like a\npain just to move from one place to\nanother.\n>> Okay, I can understand that. But one\nthing right from experience running with\nTerraform a lot is that you must be able\nto rename things. So that's why I want\nto decouple my logical identities from\ntheir actual physical identities. But\nthen at the same time uh my original\nplan with with like the library that I\nwrote is that you don't get to determine\nyour identities right if you use Google\ncloud or other providers usually you\ncreate a resource you don't determine\nthe ID behind the scene it's determined\nfor you. So if you change a name or a\ndescription, it's not only recreated.\nUm, and that's good for a lot of\nscenarios, but it doesn't work like for\nS3 bucket or an RDS maybe, but even then\nfor an RDS, it shouldn't you shouldn't\nforce the identity on it because then\nwhen you need to move things, then it\nbecomes disruptive. But ideally moving a\nresource between two different states\nwhere it's being managed shouldn't be\ndisruptive. It should just be like I'm\nmoving. It's an interesting little thing\nthat you said there because like we have\na com we have a config YAML which we\nessentially give to each team because\neach team essentially manages I think\nwhat we call a data product\num they could have multiple data\nproducts but let's just say\nit's one to one even though it's not and\nin that config.yaml YAML\nwe there's a whole bunch of\nconfiguration as as we all know and like\nfor example\nuh feel free to disagree with this on\nbut like at at this point in time we\nactually allow them to set what the ids\nare and these ids are you know cascade\nand in in all sorts of weird and\nwonderful ways\n>> to name different resources and you know\nlike you know how like AWS likes dashes\nand then\n>> another thing likes underscores and\ndoesn't allow you to use those\ncharacters.\n>> Other things can't be longer than a 20\ncharacters or something crazy like that\nor whatever.\n>> But like at the at this point in time,\nwe actually allow team Mango like I mean\nyou know if Mango wanted to be a pair\nthe next day we allow that but it causes\nabsolutely mayhem honestly.\n>> Absolutely. Yeah. Uh so this is what I\nmean I come from an like accounting\nbackground right and accounting entries\nwhen you want to slice and dice and\nanalyze your data you use dimensions. So\nyou attach in in AWS parlins this is uh\ntags right labels and and and all of\nthis is mutable. So you can create\nreports that aggregate by certain keys\nand then um that's why a tagging policy\nis super important and and that's why\nalso the same with the like the um\nthe example here of like how do you\norganize your states? Do you organize\nthem by that and then by by team or vice\nversa? Those should all be labeling. Uh\n>> yeah, we we do tag we do tag quite\naggressively. But like but but does\ntagging really even help here? Like if\nif if some if team mango decided to\nbecome team pair or something,\n>> it shouldn't it it shouldn't be any\nproblem then, right? If if the team team\ntag is is really a tag and not tied into\nany resource identity, changing the\nidentity, sorry, changing the tag\ndoesn't affect the identity. So\neverything that depends on it is still\npointing the original identity.\n>> Oh, I think I see what you're saying. So\ninstead of instead of like focusing on\nchanging I don't know the C resource or\nthe stack name you change the the tag\nname.\n>> Yes. And then you can like always\nredefine or because I worked at everyone\nworked at organizations and business\ndevelopment teams or organ or the a like\nthe the sorry the the C level decides to\nreorganize and and and rename the teams\nmerge the teams and it causes a mayhem\non the infrastructure level because of\num logical\n>> not good advice. physical identity,\nsorry, physical identity should never be\num attached to u should never be\ndictated by by the the organization or\nthe the product name. Um and I think\nsome clouds don't allow you that, right?\nThe problem is a ter provider and AWS\nAPIs allows you to do that and they even\nhave like this pre uh\n>> this prefix like ID prefix thing. That's\nall.\n>> You're so right, Vincent. Jesus, I wish\nI was working with you. I'm learning a\nlot just just to get chatting with you\nevery hour.\n>> The problem that you're going to get\nweeks\n>> I tried to introduce this at a company\nand I got a massive um push back from\nengineers because they are used to use\nto do click ops in the AWS console and\nthey're like I can't find my resources.\nIt was cloud for stacks and the way the\ncloud form like um calculates the\nphysical ID name was very confusing\nbecause of the nested stack way of doing\nit that causes its own set of problems\nbecause then you lose resources just\nbecause you rename a stack now the\nresources logical identity no longer map\nand it just loses track of it. So they\nthey are adding more features to like\nmanage refactoring of resources which\nTerraform already does for you. Uh but\nthen the push back was from the\nengineers that are used to go into the\nAWS console and I can't find my specific\nradius instance or my specific load\nbalancer because the name is so and I'm\nlike you the problem is the dashboard if\nyou don't have a proper dashboard that\nshows you the tags and shows you to like\nslice and dice your resources by the\ntags\n>> to data dog's credit data dog actually\ndoes a good job of servicing all the\ntags\n>> and that's what it should be right\n>> console doesn't like I swear to god I\nwas dealing I can't remember what it was\nbut I was dealing with something the\nother day in in AWS and it didn't have\nbloody tags or it didn't show the tags.\n>> Yeah, tags are not everywhere in AWS. Um\nand and also not everywhere cuz there's\na convention a lot of resources if you\nput a tag with the key name it shows up\nin the UI as the actual resource name uh\nnicely like for example on EC2 instance\nyou cannot control the instance ID but\nyou put on a tag with a name and then\nthe dash the the the dash\n>> the web stores it nicely. Yeah,\n>> but some of them don't like the RDS\nbecause the RDS and the end point URL\nfor the RDS as well.\n>> These are teams because every team works\nindependently, right?\n>> Yeah. There should be like, you know, a\nbezos whatever mandate, make sure that\neverything's bloody tag or tagable.\n>> Yeah. So I think they're doing a lot of\nwork there with like the resource\nmanager uh that the t you have now the\nability to like review all of your\nresources across your across your AWS\norc uh using the resource manager and\nthen using tags. So there are separate\nservices focused just on that on like\nmanaging resources and finding your\nresources.\n>> Cool. Cool. Okay. So\n>> I really like your tips here, but but\nstill the question remains given a\nplatform like this with lots of uh teams\nand things like this. I is is the is the\ngrid the right tool to make to to keep\nan eye on all all this stuff or what\nwould you suggest?\nBecause I need to know what's going on\nhere sometimes. Otherwise,\n>> when people ask me, \"Has Gene Mango got\nthe thing in London?\" I'll be like, \"Um,\n>> I think you should research to system.\"\nI can't speak. I think you should re\nreach out to system initiative because\nhe's often posting about like um they\nhave a programmable graph that [snorts]\nallows people to manage their\n>> system initiative. I\n>> so Adam and uh his colleagues uh demoed\nit to to to us\n>> works.\n>> Yeah. And uh to be honest, I I was a\ncomplete [ __ ] but you know, you got\nto give me credit because I\n>> as usual. [laughter]\n>> So, so he Yeah. So, system initiative,\nthey demoed this like, you know, like\nthis big square. I don't know why that's\nlike that.\n>> And then you have your your VPCs and\nthings like this. Like, first off, I was\nlike, ah man,\n>> I hate it when you you start\ninfrastructure from a networking\nperspective, but I get it. But I I hate\nit like\nlike you know like if you want Yeah. VPC\nthis VPC that\nbecause I just I just hate it. I hate\nlike a a focus on you know network based\ninfrastructure. I prefer to think of\nthings as I don't know like this level\nand then and then it goes on like\nwhatever to um eventually you know EC2\nand things like this. Um but then the\nthing that really got me was like okay\nso you you're creating resources la\n>> and then I was like how do you like\nmaintain the state and all that stuff?\nHe says oh this is just this is what it\nis right now.\n>> It was like a onetoone mapping and then\nI go like oh so how do you do that? How\ndo you like connect to the terraform\nprovider? He says oh we just run AWS CLI\nCLI commands under the\n>> Yeah. Yeah. And I was like\n>> this is crazy. No, no, this cannot work.\n>> I I initially wanted to contribution\nof this year at the beginning of the\nyear was to like find an open source\nproject and contribute to it. And I was\nlike, okay, SI is it. I'm going to look\ninto it. And the moment they showed me\nlike linked me to the TypeScript under\nthe hood, which is literally just\ncalling the AWS CLI, I was like, there's\nso much autogenerated APIs like the\ntelephone provider autogenerated. Um why\nwould you like go down to just scripting\naround the CLI like literally TypeScript\nTypeScript OSX um the thing is that's I\nthink is an implementation detail\nbecause the idea of every\num component there being uh it's a a\nprogrammable graph right the point is\nthat there are simple um imperative type\nof scripts I think it works better for\npeople that are used to simple that are\nlike like to write uh a script in YAML.\nUm basically every arrow, every\ncomponent has like um their own create,\nread, update hooks and those invoke the\nscripts and they build a whole bunch of\ncomponents with all of their CRUD hooks.\nFor example, a VPC that has the create\nhook, the read hook, the update hook\nthat directly maps to the AWS CLI\ncommands. And that's basically SI built\nthe graph with the hooks that are\ninvocable like functions. And then they\nbuilt the whole bunch of like components\nthat are using that graph. So then when\nthey create the VPC, it goes and runs\nthat AWS CLI command, that AWS CLI\ncommand when you want to update it. And\nI mean I I think it comes back to the\nthe question like why doesn't Terraform\ndo that also, right? Because Terapform\nis just talking to the AWS API. It could\njust go and find all of the resources\nthat supposedly exists based on tags\nbecause that's what um Hashimoto\noriginally did for Terraform. uh they\nwere just creating resources and using\ntags on the resources to find them.\n>> It's funny you mentioned it. I was\nrandomly watching a video and he talks\nabout Terraform as a graph API and like\nwell okay but where's your\nrepresentation of the graph?\nSo, so there's this interesting\nTerraform issue where uh they ask\nHashimoto like why didn't you just um\nyou know attack like why do you need\nstate like get rid of the state file and\nhe highlighted all of the issues that\nyou get if you don't have a state file\nif you don't um I think one of them was\nspeed um there was others because the\nphysical identity changes if the tag\nchanges um so they tried it and they\nsaid and it didn't really work so um\nbasically you're saying that Hashimoto\ndid try something what system initiative\ndid but it was just not going to work\n>> a long time ago right and I think things\nchanged a lot so I don't know um I think\nthere's some interesting ideas uh but I\nhad the same reaction when I looked at\nthe system initiative when I really\nlifted up the the whole\n>> feel for dismissing the whole idea\nbecause I just thought like it wasn't\ngoing to work just instinctively but but\nnow yeah now I mean I started this\nconversation saying that I need I need\nto see a visualization and then we just\ngo back to system initiative.\n[snorts] Uh yeah, I mean I guess they\nthey could convince us in the end. I\nthink this is one of the main what I\nlearned from building my library is that\nthe framework in itself maybe is\napproaching the problem from a certain\nway but the actual utility comes from\nthe library of components that comes\nwith it because like you can interact\nwith the cloud however you want like you\nwant to use a state file or you want to\nuse a kubernetes operator or you want to\nbuild pulley um you know typescript to\nevery possible language sure go ahead do\nall of that the problem is if you cannot\ngive me a nice library of components. If\nyou like when I looked at crossplane,\nthere was no proper um you know\navailable publicly available set of\ncrossplane um resources that I could use\nwith AWS. I would need to build\neverything out of the box. Uh and the\nonly framework that really has this is\nAWS CDK, right? Because it comes out of\nthe box not just with the low-level AWS\nAPI interface but also with the\nintegration patterns of how you use\nthese services together. And then the\nother framework that does that is SSI\nwhich is uh sorry SST not SSI what the\nhell uh SST which is basically using\nPalumi those basic components and then\nbuilding highle system integration\npatterns on top of it\n>> just to service integration\n>> just to repeat what my understanding\nwhat you just said you just like you got\nto use the tool that has the best\ncoverage of the of the resources that\nyou're trying to use.\n>> Yeah. And the services uh the\nintegrations have um integration\npatterns between services because if you\nuse AWS you must know every single\nservice integrated with IM kind of\npractical look at it.\n>> Yeah and and and this is what what\nsystem initiative I think spent 5 years\ndoing they started they had to spend\nafter they have the basic framework they\nhave to spend all this time to building\nall of the components for AWS writing\nevery single AWS CLI script for every\nsingle hook that a component um needs to\nyou know invoke whenever couldn't have\ngone down that path of uh what did you\nshow me that was autogenerated? Oh my I\nforgot the name of it.\n>> There there is AWSC uh like cloud\ncontrol provider that's autogenerated\nfrom the AWS API but again on its own\nthat doesn't really help because\ncreating a single API resource does not\ngive you the functionality that you need\nout of the AWS API because the AWS API\neffectively is a combination of many\nresources working together in a certain\nconfigured way. But the but system\ninitiative since they since they\nrely on AWS CLI the AWS CLI surely is\ntheir interface and that's there.\n>> Sure. But the AWS CL CLI is also just\nautogenerated wrapper around most of the\nAWS APIs, right? It doesn't give you\nlike the idea of AWS CDK. The example\nthat I like to give is I have an EC2\ninstance and I want it to give it\npermission to an IM uh to an S3 bucket.\nI want I have an EC2 instance and I want\nto give it access to an S3 bucket.\nRight? So now look at how many resources\nyou need to create. Right?\n>> Maybe you say, \"Oh, but that's a very\ncommon pattern in my organization. So I\ncreate a terapform module that combines\nthe two and then later down the line you\nhave a situation where the S3 bucket\nactually needs to trigger a lambda\nwhenever the the S3 instance does\nsomething or whatever or needs to be\nhooked up to an SNS and you keep\nextending that original very simple\nbasic pattern until it becomes a massive\nlike module with you know 40 different\nparameters to configure whatever use\ncases you now have after two years of of\nusing AWS and evolving your product. Um\nI think the right way is what what they\nare doing with AWS CDK is the actual\nservice teams and the community building\nproper um patterns around these things\nsuch as you know with abstractions such\nas I have an I principle I have an uh\nresource and I can grant a principle\naccess to a resource and if the I\nprinciple is an AWS instance and it\nneeds to implement this this this\ninterface that means it must have an IM\nrole that I can refer to. So who can\nbuild up under the\n>> hood idea of encapsulated u I guess my\nfavorite one in AWS is the the\nserverless SAM stuff.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Here's an example that got my head\nspinning the other day. Um\nso a colleague was telling me that when\nyou use ECS it creates like a bucket\nbehind the scenes. And the trouble is in\nour in in the organization that I'm what\nI'm working with, they're so strict\nabout all their their bucket policies\nand things like that. Like for example,\nI think you have to have a bucket policy\nwith some deny on it or something like\nthat. Like just off the bat when you\ncreate a but the trouble is that ECS\ncreates a bucket and it doesn't it\nrelies on that bucket not having the\npolicy for it to work. So, so basically\nthis colleague of mine was telling me\nthat they were using ECS and it wasn't\nworking and they couldn't figure out\nwhat the hell the problem [laughter] was\nbecause like if you look around ECS\ndocumentation, you won't you won't see\nthat you know ECS requires this bucket\nto work.\n>> It's kind of hidden away.\n>> Yeah. And then so so basically that's to\nshow I mean that's that's me trying to\ngive come up with a dumb counter example\nto these abstractions because then you\njust don't know what the hell's going on\nsometimes.\n>> Um especially if they use\n>> so here the extraction is the user\ninterface that AWS creates and when you\ncreate the button under the hood it\ncalls many different APIs to create the\nbucket and whatever. And when you then\nneed to capture that into infrastructure\nas code now suddenly you have to go and\nfigure out bucket policy get cascades\ndown into that bucket you're screwed.\nYou know what I mean?\n>> Okay. Yeah. What you're saying is\n>> a stupid example. It shouldn't really\nhappen, but it it happened.\n>> No, but like these things happen all the\ntime. Like I am I'm very annoyed when\npeople click ops things into a\nnon-production envir uh sorry into a\nproduction environment because there's a\ntime limit. There's a time constraint\nand they didn't have time to do to do\nthe ISC. they clicked it in on in dev\nthen they clicked it in in staging and\nnow there's a deadline and they need to\ndo it um because the IC doesn't work for\nexample\n>> when you when you click something in\n>> it will maybe enable a service uh uh\nlinked role into the AWS account\nautomatically so like you you start\nusing an AWS service if you use user\n>> interface it does a lot of things and\nyou don't even know what it is it's so\nhard to capture\n>> and that's what I like about AWS CDK\nbecause it actually capt captures all of\nthose actions. It's like a user\ninterface but a programmatic one. So\nit's built to cap like it's almost the\nsame. I mean honestly when you use AWS\nCDK and you have a bucket and you have a\nlambda and you need to connect it to\nunder the hood it's going to make sure\nthat there's a resource policy that\nthere's an IM lambda permission whatever\nif the bucket needs\n>> are you confident that like the the the\nAWS console and the CDK are are\nsynologist or onetoone because I'm I'm\nalways a bit doubtful that they are\n>> very doubtful\n>> I am very confident that\n>> 90% of the time they are because I\nbelieve AWS uses CDK internally as well\nto build their products. I believe that\nthe teams that build the API interfaces\nof those services actually contribute to\nAWS CDK to capture these things.\n>> And\n>> so did you say 80% because like yeah\nthat's a lot better than say Terraform\nwhere I'm probably like 10% you know.\n>> Oh absolutely. Terraform is a nightmare.\nUm and and and having an autogenerated\nTerraform provider is not going to solve\nthe problem again because the the\nlow-level API resources are not the\nsolution. It's a combination of them.\nAnd and then the comment I get a lot on\nReddit is like, \"Yeah, but if you're\nusing a programming language to do\ninfrastructure, you're doing it wrong.\"\nAnd the reality is again\nthe the the cloud is not as basic as it\nused to be. It's not just about creating\nnetwork subnets and and EC2 instances\nand allocating network interfaces. uh\nand that used to be probably quite\nsimple but now you have like IBV6 then\nyou have like your flow logs then you\nhave uh a flow log bucket and then you\nhave all kinds of uh integration\npatterns across different services and I\nmean case in point\n>> so sorry can you just rephrase that like\nwho said like if you if you're using\ninfrastructure you're doing it wrong\nwhat\n>> no if you're using programming languages\nlike full\n>> oh right\n>> like full uh what's it called to\nincomplete programming languages to to\nwrite infrastructure as code you're\ndoing it That's a very common um\nargument against using general purpose\nprogramming language. The the most\ncommon argument is um we just need a\nconfig file. We just need to do a\ndeclarative and we need to keep it\nsimple and it will be fine.\n>> Y yeah\nto be honest I'm usually in that camp\nbut uh but it bites all the time.\n>> Well you you can be in that camp until\nyou do something actual real work and\nthen you realize that that that's a very\nnaive approach. And then every time I I\nI I come with that argument, people say,\n\"Oh, I worked at like hundred different\ncountry large organization and we have\nno problem.\" I don't believe it. I don't\nbelieve you have a problem or I don't\nbelieve you work at such an\norganization. If you think that it's so\nsimple to just use terapform\nconfiguration.\n>> Yeah, I'm just trying to capture what\nwe're saying in a nice graphic\nin a nice slide. Uh\n>> so there's this these efforts from the\ncommunity to use basic terapform modules\nto capture all of these usage patterns\nand very quickly those modules become\njust I mean what I was going to say\n>> one\n>> yeah what what I was going to say is\ncase in point um the argument that the\nterraform sorry the argument that the\ncloud is simple and we just need to use\nbasic declarative configuration just go\nlook at the of the VPC module just go\nlook at the VPC module look at how many\num variables there are input variables\nbecause you can do um IMAP uh sorry\nwhat's it called when you have IP\nmanager um IP man no the the basically\nmanaged IP EPOM yeah IP uh yeah that\nsounds right so you can do you can set\nup a cider to control the you know cider\nsubet allocations\num you can do your flow locks you can so\nthe amount of of of things that you can\ndo is so big that if you look at that\nmodule\n>> uh alone you will notice that there's\nlike you know I don't know so many\ndifferent Torah form configuration files\neach one has a locals block that has\nmultiple indirection layers on top of\nthe uh putting Julio variable that needs\nto be set to true before the whole\nmodule can be used u but then you have\nso much in there that\nyou know you can't tell me that you just\nneed a very basic and then and then the\num the response is usually oh no problem\nI just take that beautiful module that\nhas all of these things because people\ncontribute epam I need IPv6 support. I\nneed net instance support because I\ndon't want to pay through my nose for\nnet instances. Uh sorry, I don't want to\npay for net gateways. I just want to\nspin up an instance and and save 20% um\nsorry and save 80% of the cost of of\nnet. Um so I need all of these features.\nSo I just take that module, I remove\nwhat I don't want and I keep it simple.\nBut then you have to maintain your own\nversion of that module. And as things\nare being introduced, you need to like\nmerge upstream down into your stuff. And\nbasically everyone is just forking um\nshared resources and then keeping their\nown private copy of it and then how many\npeople actually contribute back to it.\nYeah,\n>> I think that's that's just a\n>> in my current client we have so many\ndifferent constructs and uh\n>> they're using AWS CDK, right? and they\nare trying\n>> well we're mix now we're using a mix\nbetween CDK and ter but historically\nthey were using CDK\n>> yeah it works but yeah it's but but we\nhave that problem as you describe so\nthere's nothing that to help me\nvisualize this Vincent [ __ ]\n>> well does\n>> you have access to the grid\n>> um but\nuh\n>> so what the grid does is right now I\nmean the grid But can the grid can can\nthe grid I remember the grid taking in\nterraform state but can it can can it\nalso take in CDK state because this is a\nmix between CDK and Terraform right now.\nThis is this is another thing that makes\nmy life extra exciting.\nUh um right now the grid\n>> new requirements new requirements.\n>> So the grid is you can look at the grid\nas like two two way you have one is the\ncontrol plane and two is a data plane.\nThe control plane is the is the way of\ncreating states and metadata around the\nstates such as the labels such as the\nteam or the the stage or the\n>> why do you why do you say labels is just\nlabels and\n>> tax is a very AWS specific terminology\n>> okay carry on\n>> labels is closer to K cubernetes way of\ndoing things like in in Kubernetes you\nhave labels and annotations I just um\nhave the key value pair\n>> what's annotation again then\n>> annotations you can apply to resources\nthen I think there's two different um\nprogrammatic parts. One of them is meant\nto be like the label queries are meant\nto be much faster to query across the\nstate and the annotation is less\nqueryable. I think that's why they\nseparate the two.\n>> Wow. An annotation is um\n>> some information that you can like the\nannotations you were using for like on\nan ingress manifest. You may have an\nannotation that the controller is\nenginex ingress for example and another\ningress manifest might be controlled by\nanother um um ingress controller. So\nthat goes into annotations but the\nlabels is like um you want to do label\nqueries against the resources to find\nthem. I know that when it when they were\nasked about like in Kubernetes why do\nyou separate labels and annotations and\nthe response was one is much more f like\nperforms much better to query.\n>> Yeah because you know everything in\nKubernetes is uses label queries to to\nselect resources. Right.\n>> Right.\n>> So you don't you don't have Okay. So\nthere's no CDK. Okay. There's there's\nnothing that that will help.\n>> No. Right. Now the the grid is purely\nfor Terraform state. The problem with\nCDK is it's cloud form, right? Cloud\nform manages the stacks.\n>> Couldn't you add a source for cloud for\n>> I think I think if you look at spacelift\nor um mass driver, they may they support\nboth. I think the way that you describe\nyour um your your your your employer's\num what do you call it infrastructure is\nthat you you had you had CDK and then\nyou and then and then you oh and then\nyou get it and then you and then you\nconverted to to Terraform. Oh [ __ ] You\ndon't use you don't use ter you don't\nuse CDK at all do you? [ __ ] I now\nremember your your setup.\n>> You translate everything.\n>> I worked at different companies.\n>> Okay. Okay. So everything's terraform\nbasically.\n>> I'll tell you that my my issue was um\nbefore we have cloud formation on one\nteam and terraform on another team and\nas a platform team for example we like\nto create our landing zone using\nterraform. So we have our networks or\nclusters that maybe we have a shared\nKubernetes cluster that both teams need\nto land into. That's your landing zone.\nSo what we need to be able to do is\nexpose those integration points, right?\nSo team B needs to be able to read\nwhere's my cluster ID and how do I or\nhow do I hook up my product repository\nso that the Argo CD deployments going\ninto the right cluster.\n>> So you do that so sorry if I I didn't\nquite catch the beginning. So you do\nthat in terraform the the landing zone.\nSo what I'm I I'm just giving you a\ncontext of like different teams use\nusing different technologies and the\nproblem I had was I tried to create an\nintegration registry and we talked about\nthis because he says at um at your\norganization they use a massive JSON\nfile that keeps track of the integration\npoints between different um components.\nSo everything registers just writes\ninformation out to a JSON file. And I\ndid similar things like I had AWS CDK\nwrite to SSM parameter store and I had\nTerafform read from SSM parameter store\nand I had terapform right to SSM\nparameter store and AWS CDK reading from\nparameter store.\n>> Yeah. I prefer the central as I mean\nthis this in reality has lots of other\nfields. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So so the problem with with using\na JSON file you're restricted to a um\nusually a a git repository, right?\neither you go to a massive monor repo or\nuh you do a subm module across all of\nthe repository so that they have that\nJSON file or I don't know how you're\ngoing to get the file in there and\nversion control it\n>> I I kind of re I shouldn't say this on\nonline but I kind of rewrote something\nthat we used at work I I mean I didn't\nuh steal the code I absolutely wrote it\nfrom scratch using\nuh using um\nI guess a bit of claude magic So, so\nessentially what happens is that we have\nan act a reusable action which which\njust feeds in the account group or the\nthe team name\n>> and the environment and then out pops\nuh\nuh things like oh sorry this is me using\nthe action um\nsorry the other repo actually had the\nimplementation\nthere's there's an action that basically\njust out uh looks up the style the stuff\nin the actions JSON.\nIt's it's nice and fast. It doesn't do\nlike a full checkout or something weird.\nAnd uh and then just sets the extra\ninformation that that that the um that\nthe Terraform or whatever your\ninfrastructure needs like the account,\nthe region, a key for this, a key for\nthat.\n>> Yeah. The problem there is like you're\nyou're using a registry and then you\ndon't know like how stale is that value\nand who is consuming the value. That was\nmy problem. Um [snorts]\n>> well I mean if it's centralized the\nsource of truth is pretty sweet. I mean\n>> sure but if it changes how do you\ntrickle down that change or identify who\nneeds to be updated? Yeah, this is this\nis why I'm going back to this all the\ntime because I need to know\n>> what [snorts] how fresh they are here.\n>> Yeah, never mind what's where. I need to\nknow what version they're running.\n>> Um\n>> or what version they have viewed or\nconsumed.\n>> Yeah. Like we we in our repos we tag the\nthis for example and then we kind of\nallow them to\ntag their deployments or what do you\ncall it you know use a branch or\nwhatever to to pin sorry pin was the\nword I was looking for but then yeah\nthey've pinned you know version one here\nand like now we're on version five like\nhow do\n>> exactly so so this is also something I\nlearned about um this version pinning\nscenario is that if you start to deal\nwith these type of deeply nested\nstructures where you have 40 different\nstates.\n>> Just hold that thought. I got to reply\nto my wife.\nSo the kids need need to go to school. I\nthink my wife will take them. So yeah.\nYeah. Hold the thought resume.\n>> Yeah. So what we were saying is that\nversion pinning is important,\n>> right? and and when you start I started\nmy career around DevOps with Kubernetes.\nSo I learned very early that immutable\ninfrastructure your docker image needs\nto be hard you know hard pinned so that\nyou can do rolling updates because\nKubernetes doesn't allow you to use a\nmutable um label. So version pinning is\nvery important. You want to pin your\ndocker image. Kubernetes doesn't allow\nlike uh at latest or whatever the docker\n>> condition or officially the way that\nKubernetes is designed is to use\nimmutable tags and then the way that it\ndetects that that um a deployment needs\nto be rolled is when you change\nsomething right you change the tag and\nso it spins up a separate replica\ncontroller starts\n>> I didn't realize it enforced it yeah I\nknow best practice is to use a is to use\n>> yeah and there's a lot of workarounds\nlike keep or ke sorry to basically um\ntrack um you know a docker hub image\nrepository and identify if a new um\nmetadata if a new checksum has been\npushed for a certain latest tag and then\nautomatically trigger a rolling update\nbut then you have to work around it by\nby changing the labels and then it will\nstart rolling out pods with new labels\nthose are all workarounds the original\ndesign of Kubernetes is very simple your\nimage tag is what determines the version\nthat runs so you cannot use a mutable\ntag. You have to specify which version\nyou want to run and if you want to\nupdate it, you change Kubernetes\nmanifests. What what helps you update\nthem? Sorry. Like how do you what's the\nworkflow for people like do they get\nlike a dependabot like oh you need to to\nbump.\n>> Yeah. So we're we're going back to the\npoint that the design when you start\nwith Kubernetes and Docker and immutable\ninfrastructure is that version pinning\nis very important, right? And and as you\njust highlighted also when you get a lot\nof different states and a new version\nhas been published but um you have all\nof these um you know very niche um\nlittle states that haven't been touched\nfor a long time and they're still on\nversion one right and now you and then\nfor example you have a big um\norganizationwide initiative that you\nneed to upgrade the provider and then\nyou find out that some really deep uh\nnested areas are still using a very old\nversion and now they suddenly have to go\nall the way to production and they're\nlike\nthe answer. I [laughter] need to know\nthe answer. How you keep\n>> So, so funny funny enough. Funny enough,\nuh, one of my previous colleagues, he\njust got rid of all of the versioning.\nHe trunk based just\n>> Well, this is this is what I like to do\nin a in a sense. Just tell everyone you\ngot to use latest.\n>> See you.\n>> Yeah. Latest or at stable or something\nor there's probably some other type,\n>> right? And but if you're in a monor repo\nand and you're you're running off git,\nyou just point to head, right? So so\nwhen you run your IC for example and it\nchecks out the repository and it it gets\nhead and so it gets all the latest\nversion of your modules together with\nhead of your um because like imagine\nthat you have a infrastructure mono and\nyou have a GitHub action or Atlantis\nrunning to to do your IC terapform plan\napply. So the first thing it does on\nyour branch or of master it will check\nout the repo and it will take head right\nand then instead of version pinning\nevery single module which is the\nrecommended right way to do instead of\nversion pinning any every module you\npoint everything relatively within the\nrepo to your current like head.\n>> Got it.\n>> Right. Which is trunk based development.\nRight.\n>> Right. And at that point that means\nevery single change you make to a module\nautomatically gets procreated across\nyour whole infrastructure.\n>> Yeah, that means but that means you have\nto deploy in a in a with some rigor some\nschedule, right?\n>> No, you you have to use feature flags\nand you have to release features like\nfor example if you're going to so this\nis what we do at my organization right\nnow. We we have gotten rid of all the\nmodules.\nSo trunk based trunkbased infrastructure\nwith feature facts.\n>> Absolutely.\nI did a a presentation about that other\nconference.\n>> This is something that Thoughtworks\npreaches for software development, but\nfor some reason I never thought about\nthis in the context of infrastructure.\n>> Yeah. So it's it's it's the same thing.\nThe first thing you have to do is you\npoint all of you get rid of all the\nmodule versions. you point to the\nrelative path or you make sure that\nyou're always checking out the latest\nversion of the modules, right? And then\nwhen you run your Terraform plan, of\ncourse, you have to control how those\nfeatures get rolled out, right? So the\nbest way to control how features get\nrolled out across your infrastructure is\nby putting in feature flags, right?\n>> So we're adding a new, for example,\nwe're adding a new we're doing a\ndatabase migration. I'm changing my\nmodule to to provision the new database\nas well as keep the old database\ninstance running and it's behind a\nfeature flag. So when this gets applied\ninto dev, it's going to spin up a new\ndatabase. It's still going to have the\nold database there and we're going to\nstart pointing our customers um to the\nnew one, our client to the new one. If\nwe're doing this with a cut over, uh we\nobviously need\n>> How do you do this with Terraform? But\ncarry on.\n[clears throat]\n>> It's very simple on your module. You\njust put a variable that that um sets\nmigration enabled true and in production\nis disabled and then you have another\nvariable that says uh delete the old\ndatabase and then you you you toggle the\nthe flags as you are getting confident\nyou have the same code running in depth\nyou have tested it then you're going\ninto staging you've tested the cut over\neverything then you ready go to prod\nyou're doing the first flag on the new\ndatabase gets created you re reconfigure\nyour clients you turn on the second flag\nthe old database gets deleted your cut\nover is done and then you go back to\nyour module, you delete folds variables\nand across your real estate everything\nis replanned with the latest version of\nthat module and it works because you've\ntested it everywhere, right? Your your\nmodule is immediately planned everywhere\nand it shouldn't show you any diff when\nyou remove them. So, it's feature flag\ndevelopment, you know, with u\n>> I've never heard of this in all honesty.\nI thought I've never seen\n>> I do that with Atlantis only. Um um at\n>> does Atlantis have some some sort of\nsupport for feature flags.\n>> No, but I basically just do an enable\nauto plan and I automatically I have\nAtlantis project detection integrated\nwithin my repo bootstrapper. So when I\nset up my repository, it automatically\ngenerates the configuration for every\nsingle directory for Atlantis to figure\nout whenever this module changes, you\nneed to replan all of the states that\ndepend on that module. And so whenever\nanyone makes a change to a module, it's\nimmediately tested everywhere. Like if\nit's going to have an impact on pro,\nthat PR is immediately blocked because\nyou haven't put in a feature flag on the\nvariable. So you need to set up a\nvariable to make sure that it's by\ndefault acting like originally and then\nyou go and update the call sites where\nyou want this feature to be deployed and\nthen you set now enable it here and then\nyou test it in dev. It's okay. Then we\ncan go um and and and push this module.\nWe can get the PR merged because then we\ndo multiple PRs to roll it across our\nenvironments and that way we don't have\nlike some really old state using a\nreally old module. We always have\neverything on head.\n>> That's the goal.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, I like that a lot. Wow.\n>> Wow.\n>> And so\n>> the requirement is to have the\ncapability to define what is the\ndependency or which modules a state\ndepends on. Is it if you don't do that\nright, you're back to your original\nsituation where everything is version\npint and then now you could discover\nthat one particular team is still using\nversion 1.0 and if you're doing sambar,\nright, you're on version 2.0 means that\nyou have a breaking change, right? So\nthey have to\ndon't I mean or\n>> or uses it as an excuse to break an API\nwhich is\n>> yeah but I'm I'm so I'm doing that\nturnbased development on my IC with\nfeature flex but I am still every single\ntime doing sar on my modules because I'm\nsnapshotting the module version in case\nanything happens I can always pin it so\nthis is something that happens sometimes\nis this module this change is\nsignificant and it's we can't just put\nit behind a feature flag because that's\nthe the the the flip side of feature\nflags, right? You cannot control the\ninteraction of the flags if you have so\nmany flags on them. So, at some point um\nthe risk is that maybe one team is\nadding a variable for their use case and\nother teams another variable and how do\nthose interact with each other? You\ndon't know how they interact with each\nother. So, it's nice to say like, oh, we\nknow all of the possible configurations\nof the feature flags together. We know\nthat it's going to work. we don't if we\ndon't clean up feature frags and if we\nif we are not careful we we have other\ncomplexities to deal with. Um\n>> yeah so it's not it's not there's no\nsilver bullet of course I think I know\nwhat you mean there like [laughter]\nclean yeah like then you have you know\nnew problem uh\n>> so so every single module change comes\nwith a server like change log and an\nactual snapshot of that module pushed\ninto an S3 bucket. So if we need for\nwhatever reason we can pin a module but\nit's highly discouraged if you do like\n>> if you do go ahead and pin it then I set\nup um a scheduled action that that\ndetects any states that have a pinned\nmodule and then it goes and uh tries to\nunpin it and creates a PR to unpin it\nand then the idea is that we need to get\nthose PRs merged as soon as possible to\nbasically unpin the modules otherwise\nthese particular states will start to\nback behind and become more of a\nheadache and lead you down yak shaving\npaths down the line. Right. [snorts] Um,\n>> cool, man. Thanks. Thanks for all that\nwisdom, man.\n>> But that all works if you're in a monor\nrepo, right? Um\n>> and and and and then the other\nalternative actually to just this week\nconfig hub it was announced like last\nweek but this week they they did an IT\nnext article where they go into details\nabout the problem of YAML manifest and\nArgo CD. They're basically highlighting\nhow a lot of people are abusing Argo CCD\nuh with Helm to you know in memory on\nthe Kubernetes cluster um expand all of\nthe YAML manifests and then fire it off\nat the Kubernetes cluster and then they\nhave no idea what's happening. Um so\nthey are they're introducing the concept\nof um infrastructure as data. No\nconfiguration as data. C A yeah it's CA\nA and\nI really still don't know exactly how\ntheir platform but their platform.\nYes. Uh oh there's another one Napio but\nthere's one from\ntoday. It's definitely it's Brian Grant\nstartup. There's a one that was posted\nlike like maybe 12 hours ago from config\nhub where they go into the problems and\nthe solution of configuration as data.\nUm and in in the problems they are\nhighlighting like the ren the renovate\nbot approach. So if you version pin your\nmodules or version pin your helm charts\nthen you set up something like renovate\nto automatically create pull requests to\nupdate your things.\n>> Yeah. I mean actually at my workplace\nthey've written a beautiful like 100\nline uh Python script and what it does\nit's it's called distribute py and you\nyou can have a config to say like you\nwant these paths pushed to these repos\nor even I think even it supports like\nhierarchy. So, so basically like if if\nthey want to make sure that every team\nin dev has this new config set, they\npush it out or a new file in their in\ntheir repos, they just push it out\n>> so that everyone has a new workflow that\nthey they they can use or the or their\nworkflow in their in their repos.\nActually, this is what this thing is\nmissing repositories.\n>> Yeah. All of that mapped across repos.\nBut like uh I guess the repro would sit\nhere but like yeah it it pushes it out\nand they do this and they said like I\nsaid like wow I've never seen this\nbefore. So you didn't want to get the\npendot like a like a pullbase flow going\nlike he says no pullbase will not work\nin our organization. We need a push we\nneed to be fast and it needs to be\nupdated like immediately\n>> and I was like wow I've never seen that\nbefore.\n>> When they say push do they do do they go\nand create pull requests in the other on\nthe other ones? Direct commit.\n>> Direct commit. Yeah, they have like a\nbot and it just like just overwrites\nwhatever they have.\n>> So, this is my biggest issue with all of\nthese like cookie cutter and\nbootstrappers. Most of them they do a\nonetime bootstrap and they never\nconsider the the day to\nI created an issue about this in GitHub.\nUm, let me see if I can\n>> Oh, forget about GitHub template repos.\nI hate them. Every time I see somebody\nuse them, I I just immediately want to\nshut that down. It's like don't don't\n>> um yeah like here's my question here. Hi\nthere. How do you should a repository be\ngenerated from a template keep up to\ndate with an evolving template?\n>> Yeah,\n>> it says GitHub templates are designed\nfor onetime scaffolding.\nYeah. So\n>> I created a worm in my previous\norganization.\n>> So what do you mean to update stuff?\n>> Yeah. So whenever I created a PR on my\non my template repo, it would\nautomatically create commits in my other\nrepositories to pull it in to the to\npull in the diff from that PR. Uh except\nthat it would copy to itself and then\ntrigger itself. And I had to like\nexplicitly allow uh GitHub action\nworkflows to trigger themsel. And then I\nI I created like 70 plus emails per\nminute across the whole email system.\nAnd then my C after like half a day my\nmy CTO sent me a message like what's\nhappening? [laughter]\n>> What what do you mean you're sending\nemails to different people?\n>> Yeah.\n>> No, because GitHub action run started\nlike failing and sending emails like the\nthe run failed and so I was literally\nspend three hours killing killing action\nruns.\n>> Uh [laughter]\nit was a lot of fun. So I I had this\nidea as well like originally with with\ntemplate repos maybe like five years ago\nto to automate this push down to all of\nthe repos that all.\n>> So I I I mean in all in all honesty at\nthis particular client I think the push\nmechanism works quite well because you\nknow the relationship they have with the\nteams like\n>> you know like these are data teams they\ndon't know what they're doing. They need\nthis thing up to date now.\n>> And then the other thing is the moment I\nstarted using progen projen.io IO which\nis popular within the AWS CDK ecosystem.\nUm, Proen.io\nuh is kind of like the Pandaot. When you\nbootstrap a repository with with this\ntool, it sets up an update uh scheduled\nupdate uh system. So you can define like\nonce a week, daily, and you can also set\nup automerge and all that. and and and\nso what it does is it it runs the it it\ndownloads the latest version of the\ntemplate and it runs it and it basically\nmod like selfmutates and and keeps the\nrepo up to date and then automerges. So\nit's pool based but it happens\nautomatically\n>> but like but\nI I'm not too sure how we got here. We\nwere talking about uh configuration\n>> unpinning and pushing.\n>> I'm actually not sure dependabot is a\nvery scalable solution. Um well it\n>> uh so one thing I don't like about\ndependabot is that it creates so many\nPRs and and that's why I usually\ndisabled it but you can actually set up\ngrouping.\n>> Yeah I know there was one repository\nwhere I think I set up auto like\n>> auto actually how did I do that again?\nUh oh,\n>> you have to create a a GitHub token for\nan automerge uh bot to to\n>> I'm not too sure how I can find my own\nautomerge. What What should I search\nfor? H PR\n>> I use dependabots with um release please\nand automerge on my Golang CLI for\nTerraform. It's a public repo. You want\nto see it?\n>> Um okay. If you Well, I mean I've done\nit before. I just can't remember where I\ndone it.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. The problem um with dependabot is\noriginally my biggest issue was all of\nthe different PRs but you can set up\ngrouping rules. You can say like for\nthis buckets manager you group all the\nPRs um instead of creating like five PRs\nyou create one for go dependencies for\nexample and and then you set up the\n>> the question remains like you can't\nexpect all these different teams to\nbasically\n>> merge the PRs and that's where things\nreally That's why I don't think that\nwhat you mentioned earlier about the\npush flow is automatically committing to\nmaster. I think what it's doing is it's\ncreating a branch. It's creating a PR.\nIt's it ts it with a label and then it\nsaid it's pushing it straight to main.\nThey usually updating workflows. They\nonly usually do it for updating\nworkflows.\n>> I think it's either it's pull or push.\nIt doesn't really matter much. Um, but I\nhave the same flow which it just creates\nu a PR that the PR is labeled as\nautomerge and then you have an automerge\nbot that will auto approve actually\nsorry the PR is labeled as auto approve\nand then that bot will auto approve\nthose PRs and then it will enable the\nautomerge as soon as the checks pass. So\nI will never merge or commit straight to\nmaster.\n>> That's quite a complex setup but I guess\nit's\n>> I mean let me share my screen and I'll\nshow you the repository. It is a public\nreport.\nUh\noh, not what I\n>> is requesting you to allow multiple\npresenters to share. Okay, whatever.\n>> Okay, I'm sharing.\nWhich one am I sharing? This one. I\nguess\n>> I think we got to wind up in a couple of\nminutes just because I've got I got so\nmuch work today. Oh my god.\n>> And we never talked about we never\ntalked about AI. Oh god.\n>> [snorts]\n>> So here I have this Golang binary. It's\na fork from\n>> Are you sharing? I can't see it.\n>> Oh, sorry. You can see it now.\n>> Yeah, I can see it now.\n>> Maybe let me drag it out of all these\ntabs so it's a bit less confusing. So um\nI forked this from the Chan Zuckerberg\nFoundation, the wife of um some Facebook\ndude. I don't know.\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n>> And they create they have a um\n>> Oh, do do quick sign up. Do you know um\nSwix? Uh what's his real name? He's\nSingaporean guy.\n>> No, I mean you met him.\n>> Um I forgot his real name. I just call\nhim by his uh his handle. He did an\ninterview with Mark Zuckerberg like last\nweek.\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> Um so you know, one one connection away.\nOkay. Yeah. Carry on.\nSo, so this is a nonprofit that uses\nTerraform to bootstrap some of the\nservices that they use and they have a\nvery uh they have a lot of tooling there\nuh some of Golang like tooling and this\none is a very opinionated Terraform\nbootstrapper. Um, the reason I like it\nis because after using Terra Grant,\nhaving all of your different Terraform\nstate configurations spread across the\nrepo, it was very hard to keep track of\nlike exactly how things were organized.\nAnd so this uses a central manifest, a\ncentral YAML file that basically defines\nthe layout of the repository. Um the\nidea is that this gets used across\nproduct repos so that every every team\nis basically bootstrapping terraform the\nsame way and then you can update the\ntemplates and then every team updates\ntheir fog version and then it updates\nthe repository across right. Um I'm\nusing it in a monor repo way which is\nnot really the intended design. So I\nadded features to like distribute the\nconfig file. So I ended up with kind of\nlike an in between. Um but yeah, I I\nbasically forked it and I've been adding\na lot of features. But what we're\ntalking about is how do the releases\nhappen here, right? So in this case, I\nalso have this uh dependabot\nconfiguration to automatically update my\ngo dependencies and it doesn't directly\nmerge I mean it doesn't commit to\nmaster, right? It creates a different PR\nand it does a terapform group as you\nsee, right? It groups all of the\ndependencies that are related to\nTerraform uh modules and groups them all\ninto one place. So it picks up like um\nwe're getting the latest go-getter uh\nand if there's another module that is\nrelated to the terapform group, it will\nbe part of this PR and then what happens\nis it automatically lets adds the bot\nmerge label and that gets auto approved\nbut it's using my pat so it's showing me\nas the approver so it's using my GitHub\ntoken to approve this and as soon as all\nof the the the CI/CD passes on the pull\nrequest only then does it merge right\nit's it enables automerge and when\neverything like see it enables automerge\nAnd when all is good and all the tests\npass, then it gets merged. So you get a\nvery controlled way of of deploying.\n>> Your profile looks like the opposite of\nmy profile in GitHub. That's weird. Like\nI'm looking one direction, you're\nlooking the other direction.\n>> This is Scarface, right?\n>> Oh, that's not you.\n>> Not me. [laughter]\n>> Yeah. Um, so so that I like this. I like\nthis a lot. And what happens is all of\nthese u dependency updates get merged\nonto master and then Google release\nplease keeps track of them and basically\ntells me the next release that's going\nto happen is going to include all of\nthese bumps.\n>> But have have you used this in anger? I\nmean have you used this with several\nteams? I'm just wondering if this is\ngoing to work.\n>> So we use this CLI across our Terraform\nrepos but they're large. So we have like\ntwo or three of them and basically fog\nis dictating the the the layout of the\nterraform repo and integrating with\nAtlantis and also now integrating with\nTerra constructs. So it's bootstrapping\nTypeScript projects, it's setting up the\nTS config, it's setting up ES linting\nrules, everything. So so all of those\ntemplates are inside fog and I I still I\ndon't recommend it because uh we're\nusing it and it's working for us but\nsome people might not really like some\nof the things it does, right? Um but\nyeah it does the full repo remote and it\ncontrols some part of what the grid will\ndo. It controls how these components\nlink to each other. So it determines\nwhat is the remote state for that\ncomponent. So if you have a landing zone\ncomponent and you have a cluster\ncomponent and the cluster needs to to\nunderstand where is the network created\nby the landing zone then it will read\nthose outputs from each other. So that's\nthrough the remote state right so so\nit's a very opinionated way again\noriginally from from Chan Zuckerberg but\nI added a lot of features on top of\nthat.\n>> That's interesting. That's really\ninteresting. Nonetheless, I think I\nthink in in my current gig, the\nthe different teams are not really\nowning the infrastructure. So, I don't\nneed them to do a lot of complexity. I\njust need them to do the data type\nstuff. And I think I can control that\nbetter not using this. But I don't know.\nThis is really interesting. But, okay, I\ngot to wind up here because I got to I\ngot to go go straight into into work\nmode.\n>> Okay. Great talking with you. Um,\nunfortunately we didn't talk anything\nabout AI.\nI don't know, maybe maybe another\nmorning we can I can do the same thing.\nJust let me know.\n>> [ __ ] Actually, I I I found out remember\nyesterday we talked and I said that\nthere's um I was doing like a quick\ndashboard because I'm using beats to\ntrack issues for the LLM.\n>> Yeah, you showed me. That was great.\nYeah.\n>> But there are actually like six or seven\npeople doing the same thing.\n>> That's the beauty of AI, isn't it? It's\nso beautiful.\n>> Yeah. So, so I found some u kind of\nworking dashboard and it's pretty neat.\nIt gives you like a full overview of\nyour large features and your\n>> epics. Let's pick up on that next. Don't\nno more talking about infrastructure\nfull AI next talk. Okay.\n>> And uh I'm happy to wake up in the\nmorning. Just let me know what day suits\nyou.\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n>> Could be could even be tomorrow. I don't\nI don't mind. See you.\n>> Sounds good. Yep. See you. Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:52]\nWell, good morning, Vincent. >> Good morning. >> It's been uh couple of weeks, hasn't it? Or [snorts] something. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Could be at least 10 days, I think. >> Yeah. I wanted to start by asking you a couple of questions. Maybe an info um let I mean, we're both infrastructure engineers, so I have an infrastructure question for you. >> Okay. So this is a wonderful GitHub account of this person here. >> I was just trying to >> so imagine there's like an AWS landscape like this where where where the fruits here are basically different teams, right? >> Yeah. So the so some teams have a dev account, some some have a some have the whole you know the whole shebang. Um and actually this is not even accurate like sometimes they can have deployments in different regions right could be U1 >> I should have sorry this is not the best example but you know I was I had to be quick about it. [snorts] Um so so each team like potentially has has a a number of deployments so we say right I think that's the the correct terminology because they could have a deployment in USC East1 Singapore same account different environments and each environment is mapped to an account. Yeah. So the my question is is that like I have a landscape like this in a in a big company to manage and often enough I'm like you know does team Mango have stuff in this region and like I don't know. Um but it's even worse. I mean if I had this uh up to date Jason JSON I probably could easily quickly answer yeah okay they should have stuff in new east one >> but the trouble is that sometimes it's it's up to the different teams to deploy their own infrastructure so it's like then again I don't even know if they've actually really done deployments you know what I mean it's like so as a platform engineer I have to like sort of keep an eye on what people are doing but it's very difficult for me to keep it so I thought to myself this example is one I struggle with on a daily basis. Does Tacos or your tool or I guess I mean Terraform Cloud will probably be the greatest tool for this but like how do I track? >> Yeah. So with with the grid what I I do and I think other tools uh like Terra Team or Digger or Spaceelift they also have the concept of labels. So teams can attach labels to states and you can track if um if they are having states for resources inside a certain region. Now the problem could be if you are doing multi-reional terraform right if you could if you have one state that creates um for…\n\n[slide:2] [5:32–17:15]\n>> With AWS OUS, uh they can be like nested, right? And you can attach policies to the OU. So you can attach the non-prod policies to the nonpro OUS and then all of the teams operate within those and then when you go to prod, there's more guard rails and and security. >> So yeah, I see what you're saying. So the policies apply on top level top level I'm not sure that's the right term stage. >> Yeah. >> And then and then that trickles down. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Why haven't I done that? I feel dumb for not having even done that. >> I mean because you came from an environment where they were sharing an account and it was causing issues. But AWS is actually at some point I read this book from uh like microservices from Sam Newman I think and he was like saying in the book how AWS even goes so far as to give every environment an account. So that you know like team A prod has one AWS account and team B prod has a separate AWS account. Uh actually even worse like team A has two services FU and bar and then team A FU stage goes into one account and team uh A bar stage goes into another account which is like so you need to do all of the peering and like you know you can only connect uh or communicate across account boundaries which is crazy from like from a small startup's perspective to to be to have to have all of this AWS account management overhead right [snorts] um Another thing is what we wanted was the ability to um [clears throat] vent an AWS account for a team for a limited amount of time >> and then once they were done with it like return it to a pool. So we wanted on demand account creation. >> You return it to a pool then you just destroy it. >> Well that's the thing. Originally AWS didn't have a lot of AWS uh a lot of API for account management. So destroying an account was very difficult. >> Yeah. Yeah. I see what you're saying. >> So, so the idea is to run >> I made a video about that. >> Yeah. So, the idea is is to run like nukes and and and basically have a pool of accounts and and cycle through them. Uh which is a lot easier and there's a lot of tools to do that. >> Do you so you've used AWS Nuke? I think it changed. >> Uh there's two of them. I think I use the other like there's one from Terra Grant which is very popular or um not Terra Grant but the Grunt Works nuke uh that has been forked. I don't I don't think I liked >> you. >> Yeah, I think the fork was better and there's the grunt work one wasn't good. There's a cl there's a…\n\n[slide:3] [16:55–28:39]\nhave like this pre uh >> this prefix like ID prefix thing. That's all. >> You're so right, Vincent. Jesus, I wish I was working with you. I'm learning a lot just just to get chatting with you every hour. >> The problem that you're going to get weeks >> I tried to introduce this at a company and I got a massive um push back from engineers because they are used to use to do click ops in the AWS console and they're like I can't find my resources. It was cloud for stacks and the way the cloud form like um calculates the physical ID name was very confusing because of the nested stack way of doing it that causes its own set of problems because then you lose resources just because you rename a stack now the resources logical identity no longer map and it just loses track of it. So they they are adding more features to like manage refactoring of resources which Terraform already does for you. Uh but then the push back was from the engineers that are used to go into the AWS console and I can't find my specific radius instance or my specific load balancer because the name is so and I'm like you the problem is the dashboard if you don't have a proper dashboard that shows you the tags and shows you to like slice and dice your resources by the tags >> to data dog's credit data dog actually does a good job of servicing all the tags >> and that's what it should be right >> console doesn't like I swear to god I was dealing I can't remember what it was but I was dealing with something the other day in in AWS and it didn't have bloody tags or it didn't show the tags. >> Yeah, tags are not everywhere in AWS. Um and and also not everywhere cuz there's a convention a lot of resources if you put a tag with the key name it shows up in the UI as the actual resource name uh nicely like for example on EC2 instance you cannot control the instance ID but you put on a tag with a name and then the dash the the the dash >> the web stores it nicely. Yeah, >> but some of them don't like the RDS because the RDS and the end point URL for the RDS as well. >> These are teams because every team works independently, right? >> Yeah. There should be like, you know, a bezos whatever mandate, make sure that everything's bloody tag or tagable. >> Yeah. So I think they're doing a lot of work there with like the resource manager uh that the t you have now the ability to like review all of your resources across your across your AWS orc uh using the resource manager and then using tags. So there are…\n\n[slide:4] [28:19–40:03]\nusing AWS and evolving your product. Um I think the right way is what what they are doing with AWS CDK is the actual service teams and the community building proper um patterns around these things such as you know with abstractions such as I have an I principle I have an uh resource and I can grant a principle access to a resource and if the I principle is an AWS instance and it needs to implement this this this interface that means it must have an IM role that I can refer to. So who can build up under the >> hood idea of encapsulated u I guess my favorite one in AWS is the the serverless SAM stuff. >> Yeah. >> Here's an example that got my head spinning the other day. Um so a colleague was telling me that when you use ECS it creates like a bucket behind the scenes. And the trouble is in our in in the organization that I'm what I'm working with, they're so strict about all their their bucket policies and things like that. Like for example, I think you have to have a bucket policy with some deny on it or something like that. Like just off the bat when you create a but the trouble is that ECS creates a bucket and it doesn't it relies on that bucket not having the policy for it to work. So, so basically this colleague of mine was telling me that they were using ECS and it wasn't working and they couldn't figure out what the hell the problem [laughter] was because like if you look around ECS documentation, you won't you won't see that you know ECS requires this bucket to work. >> It's kind of hidden away. >> Yeah. And then so so basically that's to show I mean that's that's me trying to give come up with a dumb counter example to these abstractions because then you just don't know what the hell's going on sometimes. >> Um especially if they use >> so here the extraction is the user interface that AWS creates and when you create the button under the hood it calls many different APIs to create the bucket and whatever. And when you then need to capture that into infrastructure as code now suddenly you have to go and figure out bucket policy get cascades down into that bucket you're screwed. You know what I mean? >> Okay. Yeah. What you're saying is >> a stupid example. It shouldn't really happen, but it it happened. >> No, but like these things happen all the time. Like I am I'm very annoyed when people click ops things into a non-production envir uh sorry into a production environment because there's a time limit. There's a time constraint and they didn't have…\n\n[slide:5] [39:43–51:27]\n>> You translate everything. >> I worked at different companies. >> Okay. Okay. So everything's terraform basically. >> I'll tell you that my my issue was um before we have cloud formation on one team and terraform on another team and as a platform team for example we like to create our landing zone using terraform. So we have our networks or clusters that maybe we have a shared Kubernetes cluster that both teams need to land into. That's your landing zone. So what we need to be able to do is expose those integration points, right? So team B needs to be able to read where's my cluster ID and how do I or how do I hook up my product repository so that the Argo CD deployments going into the right cluster. >> So you do that so sorry if I I didn't quite catch the beginning. So you do that in terraform the the landing zone. So what I'm I I'm just giving you a context of like different teams use using different technologies and the problem I had was I tried to create an integration registry and we talked about this because he says at um at your organization they use a massive JSON file that keeps track of the integration points between different um components. So everything registers just writes information out to a JSON file. And I did similar things like I had AWS CDK write to SSM parameter store and I had Terafform read from SSM parameter store and I had terapform right to SSM parameter store and AWS CDK reading from parameter store. >> Yeah. I prefer the central as I mean this this in reality has lots of other fields. Yeah. >> Yeah. So so the problem with with using a JSON file you're restricted to a um usually a a git repository, right? either you go to a massive monor repo or uh you do a subm module across all of the repository so that they have that JSON file or I don't know how you're going to get the file in there and version control it >> I I kind of re I shouldn't say this on online but I kind of rewrote something that we used at work I I mean I didn't uh steal the code I absolutely wrote it from scratch using uh using um I guess a bit of claude magic So, so essentially what happens is that we have an act a reusable action which which just feeds in the account group or the the team name >> and the environment and then out pops uh uh things like oh sorry this is me using the action um sorry the other repo actually had the implementation there's there's an action that basically just out uh looks up the style the stuff in the actions JSON. It's it's…\n\n[slide:6] [51:07–57:39]\nyou haven't put in a feature flag on the variable. So you need to set up a variable to make sure that it's by default acting like originally and then you go and update the call sites where you want this feature to be deployed and then you set now enable it here and then you test it in dev. It's okay. Then we can go um and and and push this module. We can get the PR merged because then we do multiple PRs to roll it across our environments and that way we don't have like some really old state using a really old module. We always have everything on head. >> That's the goal. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah, I like that a lot. Wow. >> Wow. >> And so >> the requirement is to have the capability to define what is the dependency or which modules a state depends on. Is it if you don't do that right, you're back to your original situation where everything is version pint and then now you could discover that one particular team is still using version 1.0 and if you're doing sambar, right, you're on version 2.0 means that you have a breaking change, right? So they have to don't I mean or >> or uses it as an excuse to break an API which is >> yeah but I'm I'm so I'm doing that turnbased development on my IC with feature flex but I am still every single time doing sar on my modules because I'm snapshotting the module version in case anything happens I can always pin it so this is something that happens sometimes is this module this change is significant and it's we can't just put it behind a feature flag because that's the the the the flip side of feature flags, right? You cannot control the interaction of the flags if you have so many flags on them. So, at some point um the risk is that maybe one team is adding a variable for their use case and other teams another variable and how do those interact with each other? You don't know how they interact with each other. So, it's nice to say like, oh, we know all of the possible configurations of the feature flags together. We know that it's going to work. we don't if we don't clean up feature frags and if we if we are not careful we we have other complexities to deal with. Um >> yeah so it's not it's not there's no silver bullet of course I think I know what you mean there like [laughter] clean yeah like then you have you know new problem uh >> so so every single module change comes with a server like change log and an actual…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This discussion between infrastructure engineers explores the complexities of managing AWS at scale, focusing on the evolution from traditional account management to trunk-based infrastructure. The conversation highlights the difficulties of tracking resource sprawl across multiple teams and regions, the trade-offs between different Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and AWS CDK, and the implementation of feature flags to manage infrastructure changes. They emphasize that as cloud environments grow, the need for robust tagging policies and automated update mechanisms becomes critical to prevent \"yak shaving\" and technical debt. *The best way to control how features get rolled out across your infrastructure is by putting in feature flags.*\n\n[slide:1]\n## Managing AWS Account Sprawl and Visibility\nPlatform engineers often struggle with visibility into which teams have deployed resources in specific AWS regions. In large organizations, teams like \"Team Mango\" or \"Team Apple\" might have deployments in US-East-1, Singapore, or London, often across different accounts for dev, staging, and production. Tracking this sprawl manually is nearly impossible, leading to the use of tools like \"the grid\" or Terraform Cloud that utilize labels to track state files. Labels allow engineers to query which resources exist in a certain region or belong to a specific team. However, multi-regional Terraform states can complicate this tracking, especially when a single state file manages cross-region resources like VPC peering. The engineers suggest that while separating state by region is a common practice, it can lead to management overhead that requires sophisticated labeling to navigate effectively.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Organizing Accounts by Stage and Security\nA significant architectural decision involves whether to organize AWS accounts by team or by environment stage. The engineers advocate for organizing by stage (dev, staging, prod) using nested Organizational Units (OUs) in AWS Organizations. This structure allows security teams to apply specific Service Control Policies (SCPs) at the stage level, which then trickle down to all teams within that stage. For example, non-production OUs can have more relaxed rules, while production OUs have strict guardrails. This approach is contrasted with the \"Sam Newman\" microservices model where every service and environment might get its own account, which, while secure, introduces massive overhead for peering and account management. To mitigate the cost and clutter of numerous accounts, they discuss using \"nuke\" tools like AWS Nuke or Cloud-Nuke to programmatically destroy ephemeral environments and return accounts to a reusable pool.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Decoupling Logical and Physical Identities\nOne of the most common points of friction in infrastructure management is the naming of resources. Engineers often face \"push back\" when they attempt to use autogenerated or non-human-readable physical IDs because developers who use the AWS console for \"click-ops\" cannot easily find their resources. However, tying physical resource identities to organizational names (like a team name) is dangerous; if a team is renamed or merged, changing the resource name can be highly disruptive and require resource recreation. The solution is a strict tagging policy where logical identities are managed through mutable tags rather than immutable physical names. AWS Resource Manager can then be used to slice and dice resources across the entire organization based on these tags. This ensures that even if a team changes its name, the underlying infrastructure remains stable while the metadata is updated.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Abstractions and Hidden Infrastructure Dependencies\nThe choice between Terraform and AWS CDK often comes down to the level of abstraction required. While Terraform is excellent for low-level resource definition, AWS CDK provides higher-level \"constructs\" that encapsulate common integration patterns, such as automatically creating the necessary IAM roles and policies when an EC2 instance is granted access to an S3 bucket. However, these abstractions can sometimes hide critical details. For instance, a service like ECS might create an underlying S3 bucket that is not explicitly documented, leading to failures if the organization has strict, global bucket policies that deny certain configurations. The engineers also discuss \"System Initiative,\" which attempts to replace traditional state files with a programmable graph that uses AWS CLI hooks for CRUD operations. While innovative, they note that such tools must have extensive library coverage to be useful, as building every component from scratch is a significant barrier to entry.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Automated Update Mechanisms and Registries\nIn a multi-team environment, keeping infrastructure configurations up to date across hundreds of repositories is a major challenge. Some organizations use a central \"integration registry\" (often a large JSON file or SSM Parameter Store) to track connection points between services. To propagate updates, they discuss two main models: \"pull\" and \"push.\" The pull model uses tools like Dependabot or Renovate to create pull requests in team repositories, but this can lead to PR fatigue and stale configurations if teams do not merge them promptly. Alternatively, a \"push\" model involves a central script (like a \"distribute.py\" Python script) that directly commits updated workflows or configurations to team repositories. While more aggressive, the push model ensures that critical security or platform updates are applied immediately across the entire organization, preventing teams from falling behind on the platform's evolution.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Trunk Based Infrastructure with Feature Flags\nThe engineers propose a \"trunk-based\" approach to infrastructure where modules are not pinned to specific versions but instead point to the latest version (head) in a monorepo. To manage the risk of this approach, they implement feature flags within Terraform variables. *Trunk based development on my IC with feature flags... we always have everything on head.* This allows a platform team to roll out a change (like a database migration) by first deploying the code with the feature flag disabled. They then toggle the flag in dev, then staging, and finally production. This workflow, often managed by tools like Atlantis, ensures that every change is planned and tested against all environments simultaneously. If a change would break production, the Atlantis plan will fail, blocking the PR. This methodology eliminates the \"version hell\" where some teams are stuck on years-old modules, ensuring the entire organization moves forward on a single, unified infrastructure path."
