The The two\nthings that I worked on was I might have\nworked on this\n>> in the top one. It was the Pi.\n>> Yeah. But there's also this um I think I\nmentioned this to you before. I don't I\nsort of vibe coded this not even with\nbeads I think with Gemini and and\nconductor.\n>> Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you tried\nout conductor.\n>> I'm very excited to hear what\n>> I don't know. I think\nI thought it did a really good job like\nall the stuff here. Um\n>> have you gone through the whole specket\nas well just as an\n>> or have you only tried? I think I've\ntried it, but like I I felt I felt the\nconductor experience was a little bit\nmore streamlined. Yeah.\n>> To be honest, I don't know exactly what\nthese archives. I think tracks are I\nthink you mentioned it before.\n>> It's it's the it's like the specs\nbasically.\n>> Yeah. So, I think I think if you looked\nin here, you can do some archeology\narchology. Archology\nand you can work out what I did. But I\nthought it was quite a smooth process. M\n>> of course the I mean is what this thing\nis is just a a very simple uh\nuh\nChrome extension. It did seem like but I\nguess this is maybe normal. You know it\ndid seem like we're generating 50 files\nto do like one tiny little piece of\nJavaScript. Um but you know I guess\nthat's just normal. I mean the I mean\nwhat and God knows how many tokens. It's\nlike it's basically 100 lines of code\nfor basically a lot of a lot of uh\nbureaucracy in some ways. Do you\n>> have Yeah, these systems like conductor\n>> it's saving my screenshots. Ah, that's\nreally cool cuz I was going like ah this\nis not working.\n>> Oh, it has a Oh, wow. It stores. Okay,\nso cloud code does the same thing but it\nshows it stores your images in your home\ndirectory.\nH\nso\nI don't know if it ever yeah see so the\nend result here it says age four months\nago but the problem is that is that\nAmazon is like sometimes having this\ninformation sometimes isn't but there is\na I did figure out there's a shorefire\nway of figuring out the the age and\nthat's to load that that AI Roffus\n>> and then you ask the AI Roffus what how\nold is the product and it will tell you\nso It's almost like the whole extension\ndoesn't need to exist. You could\n>> cuz you see it right there at the top of\nthe bar.\n>> You could just uh talk to Rufus, but\nunfortunately that's not programmatic.\n>> Oh, so wait, Rufus is an Amazon thing.\nThat's always\n>> there like an AI thing.\n>> Okay. And then the other thing I wanted\nto show you was that yeah I so this was\nan I think this is actually I told you\nthe thought experiment would be instead\nof using anible to to basically\nadminister this thing which it was\nbefore uh\nit was some anible crap and then I\nthought to myself hey I'm not going to\nuse anible I'm going to use um\nuh claude to admin to set this thing up\nand it did work. But the trouble is\nagain is that it's quite a simple setup\nand I almost think there's more markdown\nthan there was there was there's more\nmarkdown now than there was in uh in\nanible YAML\n[laughter]\nand I'm just thinking to myself and then\nof course if I had to set this up from\nscratch which I'm don't really have the\nu the uh the goal the I I don't really\nhave the u the time to do it to SC to to\nset up app from scratch using this\nreadme. I don't think it will be able to\ndo it. I mean I'm not confident it will\nbe able to do it but but but if I used\nanible\nthen I know it would there would be some\nyou know reproducibility there and I I\nknow there would be some some tests\nthere. So so basically I learned a\nlesson that that you know things like\nanible are definitely not going away.\nuh you need the anible to sort of\nuh just just to run reproducibly and\nthen you you use AI you can't use AI to\nadminister and set up a machine you\nbecause it's just not reproducible. I\nmean it's it's obvious in retrospect but\nI got I have to remind myself what\npeople say is like the ELLMs are the new\nclick ops. They're doing things and they\nyou know are not reproducible. But I see\nyou use beats for this particular task.\nDid you need more than one session? Did\nit require a big context that you needed\nto use beats?\n>> It did. It did, but I got a bit\nsidelined with things. It's It's almost\nlike being a human with the AI.\nWell, I got sidelined because there was\nthere was a networking issue. Um\n>> Yeah, that can really mess up.\n>> And the trouble the trouble is the\nnetworking issue wasn't really down to\nthe the Pi. it was down to my ubiquity\nsetup and my ubiquity setup is a bit\ncomplicated.\nUm, so basically it was it was fighting\nit all its assumptions about how the\nnetwork should work were not really\nworking very well because I had a I had\na screw up in my ubiquity thing and and\nit was just crazy. So that's kind of\ndumb. But I I wanted to show you that my\nhome setup. I think you might be\nmarginally impressed by this.\nUh let me just stop sharing. I'm so good\nat this. Here we go.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n>> I need I need to install Ghosty on my\nMac. I use it on my Arch, by the way,\nbut I don't use it on my Mac.\n>> Okay. So, this is where you might be\nimpressed.\nHave you ever played with uh machinectl\nor systemd uh endspawn?\n>> Endspawn. All right. Um only through\nrocket from core o. So that's a very\nlong time.\n>> I mean I could I could get these I could\nget it running a little bit quicker than\nI am doing now. But like for example\nI have an IP range pointing to my Pi. So\nthis is why the networking is a bit\nconfusing.\n>> So you make like a flat network. you you\ngive them you allocate the range to the\npi so that the containers\n>> so basically basically I can I can make\nthis a little bit faster but I'm just\ndebooting debootstrapping from absolute\nscratch as you can see but in the matter\nof a few seconds\nI can I can basically boot up a VPS on\nuh a on a static IP is that the right\nexpression on on a standalone IP. So\nbasically this VPS\num\ncompletely owns that IP. And I've got a\nI've got 64 of those IPs. Well,\nactually, I think 62 are usable, but\nwhatever.\n>> You get the point.\n>> So, basically, I have I I one thing that\nI was doing with this Raspberry Pi over\nthe weekend was essentially set up uh a\nway of spinning up VPS's just quickly.\nSo, I don't have to use Digital Ocean. I\ncan just use my Pi to\n>> well to\n>> How much CPU and memory does a Pi have\nthat P?\n>> Not not a lot, but it seems fast enough\nfor what I do. I think it's like 4 GB or\nsomething. [laughter]\n>> Okay.\n>> Something tiny.\n>> But this VM is like um it's like what is\nit? KVM or or\n>> it's it's using systemd nspawn which is\nsome sort of systemd thing.\n>> Still containers. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, um I don't know there's\nnothing nothing much running inside\nexcept SSHD\nthe the setup script as you can see here\nlike um I I I download the keys from\nGitHub you know cuz I don't know if you\nknow this trick this GitHub\n>> yeah I do this\n>> keys I just I just set up SSH\n>> I throw in my my keys into the\nauthorized keys\n>> set up my user disable password\nauthentication and all that sort of\nstuff And then I'm in I'm in there. Um,\nand then of course what the next thing I\nwas going to do is that I was going to\nmaybe run Docker in each one. That seems\nto work fine. So they're all isolated.\nSo they're all isolated. I can I can run\nmy little experiments in them. Um, I\nmean I could even like create you a VPS\nif you wanted one in UK.\nI could become a digital ocean, start\ncharging people five bucks a month.\nYes,\n>> but the I think the specs are pretty\nbad. Like I don't know how do I see the\nmemory?\n>> Yeah,\nI got 4 GB.\n>> But it's it's it's fun though. It's fun.\nSo I'm\n>> But this IP range is on your local\nnetwork. Now when you want to allocate\npublic IP addresses or are you using\nsomething like tail scale or or some\n>> these IPs are public\n>> also? How did you get an RP range? Uh, I\nasked my ISP very nicely and they did it\nfor me.\n>> You paid them.\n>> Well,\n>> it isn't. It's not cheap. Definitely not\nIP. Um,\n>> it's it's part of my subscription. So,\nfor example, this this this IP I set up\nhere. Uh, which one was it? I I think I\nWhat is my host name here?\n>> Uh, you want me to open it again? HTTP\n8000.\nHello Vincent. Yes, I see that. Do I see\nit on the curl\ncurl? Yes, I see H1. Hello Vincent in\ncurl.\n>> Yeah, so you get the point. Like now I\nhave I have a whole range of I have a\nsubnet of public IPs mapped to my Pi.\n>> So you can run some game servers.\n>> I can do whatever you can do with 4 GB\nof RAM.\nNow is where you start buying pies.\nAnd then but this is the thing about um\nthat I saw some people play with is\nslicer VM from um Alexis Alice. I think\nhe he built like open fast or functions\nas um\nuh functions as a service. So open fast\nis using docker under the hood to\nbasically it bootstraps your container\nwith an entry point and then when http\nrequest comes in it calls your container\nand sends the message\n>> like systemd has all these uh things you\ncan you can set up systemd to activate a\nservice on socket or something like\nthat.\n>> Yeah, socket activation for your\n>> or some other little like knockk\nknockock. It can basically spin up a\nVPS.\n>> So,\n>> so what you're saying it can be kind of\nlike serverless, but not really because\nOkay. So, what\n>> I mean CISD is is its own set of\nfeatures and tools, but it's very\ncomprehensive. Um, and you can do things\nlike I showed you. You can you can spin\nup isolated VPSs for people.\n>> It's very nice. Um, yeah, like you said,\nbut the thing is it's not really very\nstrong isolation, I think, still, right?\nUh that's where people are like\n>> I'm not I would have to research that. I\nmean that's one of the things I find a\nbig of a a bit of a t isn't a taboo in\nour industry but like isolation\n>> is one of those things that always comes\nup. Docker never really had a a very\nstrong security stance with their\nisolation. Right. Yeah,\n>> a lot of and a lot of machines basically\nassume workload isolation on on a Docker\nhost and they're just guessing, right?\n>> Um, of course, Amazon, I think, have got\na more complete story with Firecracker\nor something like that.\n>> Yes. So, that's the thing that's\n>> still but still I think there's some\npeople that are not a thousand%\nconvinced, right?\n>> Mhm. Cool. So, what I did over the\nweekend, over the weekend, over the over\nthe holidays is I\num I did my year in your review blog\npost where I had a lot of fun with with\nthe cloud code. Did you did you try it?\n>> Oh. Oh, like\n>> Oh, that one\n>> uh wrapped. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> No, no, no, no, no. I did not cloud web.\nI did uh basically I have my landing\npage which is pure JavaScript, JS and\nCSS and HTML. No React, nothing because\nI wanted maximum like speed.\n>> Oh, okay. You should share it. I Or\n>> no, that that that landing page I built\na while ago. Let me share the screen.\nUm, hold on. I don't know how much time.\n>> Yeah, I got to I got to run in like two\nminutes though.\n>> I think it's this one. Oops. Maybe.\nOh, [snorts] there's a lot of tabs.\nLet's do like that. Okay. So, I'm going\nto\nSo, this was my original landing page,\nright? And there was no blog. Oh, wait.\nI can't see anything. Am I blind?\n>> What are you seeing?\n>> Build reliable infrastructure with\nconfidence.\n>> Yeah. So, that was the original landing\npage without the the block. And this\nlanding page, I literally asked like\nCodex and Gem and Gemini back in August.\nI want SEO optimization. I explained\nwhat are my keywords that I want the\nranking because I realized that my\nwording was horrible. And this is what\nit came up with. Um, and also like it\ndoes really cool stuff like it uses\npuppeteer to launch the browser, look at\nwhich CSS elements are above the fault\nand it inlines critical CSS. So it puts\nonly the CSS needed for rendering the\ntop part of the page and then the rest\ngets loaded uh or gets loaded later. So\nthe top part render super fetch and then\nI run all kinds of lighthouse reports\nbasically. lots of fun. And then I built\nthis thing which is like the, you know,\nthe whole tour thing where it highlights\ndifferent sections of the code to\nexplain.\n>> Yeah, this I built back in September,\nright? But this is all pure JavaScript.\nSo I I I run the synth and then I it was\nreally cool to build because these\nthings are segments. So I define a line\nrange and then it draws when it when it\ndoes the I asked the codeex when you do\nthe highlight.js. I'm using highlight JS\nhere. when it renders all of the color\ncodes, the HTML elements like the divs\nand everything that creates these\ndifferent colors for this code, it\n>> creates a map of line ranges and then it\nit basically creates a big div while\nit's rendering everything around this\nthese HTML elements. So when you click\nstart and next, it basically this\nelement is already rendered within\nactually look the line range is wrong\nhere. Um and then it it highlights that\nparticular div element when you you know\n>> Yeah, I really I I do like that tour\nidea.\n>> Okay, I I need to go to my standup.\nI'll have a look at your terror\nconstructor there. But but that\n>> the block thing is on new. So I wanted\nto keep this front page fast and this\nwhole block thing this is all react. So\nthis is much slower. But I actually have\na voice\nSo, I have like the whole listening of\nthis whole\n>> I don't know if you hear the audio. Do\nyou hear the audio\n>> when I press play?\n>> Oh god, you went crazy, man. You went\ncrazy.\n>> Yeah, you have like table of contents\nwith like um scroll tracking.\n>> Yeah, I'll have a look. I have a look. I\nneed to run.\n>> I had a lot of\n>> Let's Let's catch up when I'm in a\num and let's try Yeah,\n>> it took 10 days.\n>> We We got We got to catch up on Steve\nJger stuff, too.\n>> Yeah. I see you. You're working with\nGemini. Is that why?\n>> No. No. I'm working with cloud. It has a\nskill. It knows how to use beats. Yet\nwhen I ask\n>> get it wrong sometimes.\n>> Yes. It's still getting it wrong. Like\nthere's still this\n>> there was a comment\n>> exhaustion. I guess\n>> on one of the previous uploads to the\npodcast to say as much actually that uh\nthat sometimes it didn't work. Let's see\nif I can find the comment.\n>> Yeah, there's one, right? I don't know\nhow many people are listening to us, but\nif someone comments, that's always a\ngood sign, isn't it? Someone's actually\nlistened to us. At least some parts of\nit. [laughter]\nYeah.\nUm\ngosh, community.\n>> Yay. Did it right.\nLooks better. Okay, perfect.\n>> [snorts]\n>> So,\ndid you ever have chance to play with\nthe Gas Town?\n>> Not much. No, I've still I'm still\nreading it. You know how I guess the the\nreal thing is you have to to try it out.\nBut, um,\nSteve says that many warnings, be\ncareful. This is expensive. He runs\nthree cloud three Anttopic Pro\nsubscriptions\nto run Gast Town. Each one I assume are\naround $200. So it's like $600 a month\nto to run Gast Town.\n>> It's it's crazy. But but back to the the\nthing, right, with with basically we\nhave a cloud skill that that's there. Um\nwe tell Beats um we give it information\nabout how to create beats issues and yet\nit still somehow sometimes thinks that\nwhen it needs to add a comment instead\nof doing BD comment\nadd it runs BD comment add without the s\nand then there's an alias beats have\nboth it has beat beats comments add or\nan alias for comments ad is BD comment,\nbut there's no BD comment ad. And and\nand actually it's funny because Steve\nsays that um you know this um picture of\nwhen you look at the park in a city and\nthe the city planning decides that there\nshould be roads here and here, but then\nactually when people walk to work and to\nschool and everywhere, they like walk\nacross the park.\n>> We call them car paths. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So basic basically it's a very um\ninteresting design, right? where that's\n>> and he he says you should treat the LLM\nhallucinations as such. So if it\ndelucinates something, you should\nimplement it. So next time, you know, it\nhas all the options. [laughter]\n>> It's crazy.\n>> It one thing I find remarkable about\nusing AI is that it it does like behave\nlike a human. Like it does it trips up\nin the same way. Absolutely. It's it's\ncrazy. It's just like\n>> so people who've designed some software,\nother humans must have tripped up at the\nsame point. So I find it like an amazing\nway of now validating some a design\nbecause if AI can't figure it out, the\nhumans are not going to figure it out,\nright?\n>> Yeah. Absolutely. Uh and I thought so\nI'm doing this in a context where I\nalready did a significant amount of of\nlike research and refactoring because I\nalready explained some information about\nhow to create and use beats. Um\nreexplained it and redirected it. I\nthought, you know what, I don't want to\nkill the the session. I want to keep\nthis one. and I still had like 45%\ncontext uh left. So I thought it's going\nto be fine. But maybe that's why it\nstarted to hallucinates these things.\nBut it's exactly the same as me, right?\nI can't remember. Oh, is it BD comments\nad or is it BD? Like I can't remember,\nright? I also have to go real quick go\nand look at BD help,\n>> you know? I mean, right now we're at\nlike a golden age where like the AI is\nprobably as smart as a really smart\nhuman\nand I don't know few months from now\nit's it we're getting to the point where\nyou know this mythical AGI depending how\nyou define it but like [snorts]\n>> I I I guess my feeling right now is that\nAI is going to be smarter than the\nsmartest human\nuh pretty much Now, especially when it\ngets more context, right,\n>> it and it impacts the way that we work\ntogether so much, right? I I had an off\noff recording conversation with you\nabout how does the you asked me several\ntimes like how do you see this scale\nacross a team? How do you see how do you\nkeep other team members that maybe do\nnot run cloud code yet and and engage\nthem into these like processes so that\nthey\n>> Well, it's never too late. It's never\ntoo late. It's never too late. But but\num\nI I I saw a comment on on LinkedIn just\na few hours ago which was um about using\nAI's agent to work on your issues and\nsomebody said ah I remember it was\npurely about the documentation part\nsaying like oh you know do you a lot of\npeople think that the code is the\ndocumentation and and and basically you\nshould read the code and documentation\nis always outdated but this is like um\nyou know really stupid. Imagine that you\nhave to work on React and there's no\nproper docs, right? And then somebody\nwho works at Facebook Meta told said\nthat and you know I found that a lot of\ntimes the documentation was outdated and\nthat the code actually is more accurate\nthan the documentation kind of this back\nand forth. And I feel that the whole\nidea of specri development is that you\ncompletely inverse this, right? you you\ninverse the the now you lead with\nspecification documents and you iterate\non the on the UX user experience through\nthose documents with like mockups and\nall and whatever you can\n>> get into a text format yeah that that\ncan fit into LLM workflows so the humans\nyou know with stakeholders in real life\nyou know work through these things and\nmaybe not just AI like not just other\nhuman stakeholders but definitely it's\nlike you send an email you you said hey\nJPD expand this and then the email goes\nout and then somebody hey ex compress\nthis right so so you're inter\ninteracting between humans humans and\nAIS are in in between everywhere um but\nyou start with the specifications and\nbasically the documentation is your\nliving proof and all of your integration\ntests\n>> are the validation of the documentation\nand if the integration test fails it you\nknow they're onetoone with the with the\ndocumentation and and he said well\nthat's like a fantasy because validation\nis so hard at the moment, right? Um,\n>> but I think we'll get\n>> Wait a minute. I thought we I I thought\nwe started I thought you were talking\nabout specs in the sense that how do we\nget the teams to sort of adopt that sort\nof workflow\nbecause like I I'm just speaking\nanecdotally from working with the sort\nof enterprisey clients that I work with\nthe thing that that that makes my my\nmind panic or I I don't know how to deal\nwith is that is that like these\nenterprises are so slow and AI is so\nfast\nthat the cadence is completely\nmismatched. So I like like how do you\nhow do you have these meeting how do you\ncoordinate um all the stakeholders in a\ntypical enterprise to basically iterate\nat the speed of AI and spectrum\ndevelopment. I I just don't even see it\nhappening.\n[laughter]\nBut [clears throat] maybe I'm just being\npessimistic at this point. I'm also\ntrying to find because I read somewhere\nsomeone saying basically you know I am\nentrenched in what what the same thing\nyou said I'm entrenched in these\nenterprise systems confluence and um you\nknow Jira and basically you I I don't\nlive isolated like my cloud needs to be\naware of it I need the bridge across my\n>> exactly so one thing I worked on on\nworking hours yesterday and I don't\nthink uh people were impressed or they\nthey didn't understand what I was trying\nto do perhaps even though I tried to\nexplain it to them. I I was just trying\nout this uh workflow. So I don't know if\nyou know about this u there's a couple\nof workflows. This Telefonica one seemed\nto be the most featureful one and I\nstarted at the Huh?\n>> Telefonica.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't know this\n>> Telefonica. the the biggest uh mobile\noperator in Spain, I think.\n>> Telefonica workflow.\n>> Well, anyway, they Telefonica is the big\nenterprise that that created the action\nand and what happens is that you you\nhave your I don't know if you're looking\nat my uh\n>> and now I can see it. MD Confluence.\n>> Yeah, you have all your your your\nmarkdown\n>> and what it does is that it ships it up\ninto into a particular place in your\nConfluence, right? And then it adds this\nautomation notice. This page is synced\nautomatically. Changes made.\n>> Yo, I was trying to do this like five\nyears ago. I'm so sick of confluence.\nEven the markdown editing confidence\ndoesn't work.\n>> So I was basically telling my colleagues\nthat like hey I'm doing this so that we\ncan start using markdown more which I\nthink I mean it's going to be such an\nuphill battle cuz like I I mean I'm not\nI'm exaggerating but I'm not\nexaggerating in the sense that I think\nsome of my colleagues don't even know\nwhat markdown is. You know what I mean?\nIt's like this is going to be a\nstruggle. [laughter]\n>> That's That's pretty dire.\n>> Well, actually, my answer is\n>> how do they feel about YAML then? Still\nXML?\n>> Well, it's going to take Yeah, like\num\n>> Well, they're ready for us to go full\ncircle. [laughter]\n>> They're they're in the opportune\nlocation for us to go full circle back\nto XML.\n>> Yeah, but like\n>> I mean I'm I'm probably exaggerating\nthings. I think I think my colleagues\nwill can start adopting these AI\nworkflows and we'll see very great\nresults. It's just that um\n>> I found it\n>> I'm just I'm just trying to formulate a\nplan to sort of get them using markdown,\nget them get get them in just writing\ndown things would be amazing,\n>> right? So but this is like an extension\nof the the the the code is the latest\nversion. It's like I feel there's\ndifferent tiers because you can start in\nConfluence then you can start you can\nstart you know create a project or\nrepository out of it and start writing\ndocuments in that repository and have\nthe code next to those documents and\nthen as you change things um you can you\ncan assume that it trickles back up you\nknow from the code back to the in repo\ndocs back to the conference.\n>> Yeah. Like somehow like I had this\ndiscussion at infinitum at my previous\ncompany where I was like I hated we had\nlike three four different document\nmanagement systems. We had Google Docs.\nWell I probably introduced that one.\n[laughter] We had Quip. I don't know if\nyou know that one. We had notion and\nthen we had inreo markdown.\n>> And basically you work with external\npeople that don't have notion using\nGoogle Docs. And then you have uh quip\nwhere you put like short like the um you\nknow it's like a shared document space\nand then you you um you had the original\nfounders of the company started with\nnotion and basically all of the HR\ntracking documents and everything was in\nnotion and and so\n>> that's a good way about it\n>> because but yeah so in the past it was I\ndon't know Microsoft word or something\nand then it would probably trickle into\num into into Confluence for want of a\nbetter word.\nAnd this is the temp the typical content\nmanagement of a of a enterprise. And\nthen if you're lucky if you're lucky it\nwould it would be yeah GitHub repose or\nsomething like this. This is this is\nlike the the the the machine of the\nenterprise. And what needs to happen\nreally to just to accommodate AI is that\nwell I mean this is my my current\nthinking is that the GitHub repo is is\nthe source of truth\nand then we then we go from there to\n>> to to Confluence so that other people\ncan read the docs.\n>> But then how does it get to Microsoft\nWord? Um,\nyeah. This is where things get a little\nbit weird, don't they?\n>> You still I mean, I thought you were\ntalking about the 70s when you No,\nsorry. About the the the the '9s when\nyou mentioned Microsoft Word. What are\nyou talking about? Who is using\nMicrosoft Word? I thought everyone\nalready\n>> enterprises are enterprises are like\nthere's people who, you know, don't code\nand\n>> yeah, I mean like how do you get\n>> I don't understand what you're saying.\n[laughter]\nBut this is this is the problem I have.\nHow do how do we get uh\nto this flow essentially?\n>> Yeah. So so I make a joke about this,\nbut this was exactly the problem I had\nwith my previous company cuz I kept\nsaying Markdown is a source of truth and\nhe was saying we have other people that\ndon't code. I guess I just don't get\nthat. Um and that that don't you know\naccess um markdown. He says like there's\na a design step before you go to the\nrepo.\n>> Something that is\n>> across multiple repos that's\nso the design step is is now with AI\nessentially talking to the AI and and\nand the artifact is markdown or some or\nplain text and that's that's what we're\nfamiliar with.\nI think those people that are still\nusing Microsoft Word are also those\npeople that are still uh going into a\nchat GPT session and then ask to and\nthen manually copy paste out the code\nthat it proposes. [laughter]\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or like or like do a bunch of deep\nresearch. I mean I I'm jo I shouldn't be\ntoo\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I did that\n>> the people in this in this Microsoft\nWord domain are are using JBT in their\nweb browser for sure.\n>> Exactly. Right.\n>> Um Yeah. like how how to in how to\ninclude people here in the in the AI\niterative iterative process\n>> iteratorative\niterative\nyeah this this is this is my thought\nhere so I send you a link in the chat um\nbecause for me I I think we I just I\nthink spec driven design and you just\nturned this upside down right but I can\nimagine to introduce that to enterprises\nis very hard. Uh but this guy's um appar\nthis is this post looks like my workflow\nblah blah blah but actually he's he's\none of the like it's a promotion for a\nplatform called core. So at the bottom\nyou see yes I work for core which is\nlike red planet HQ core. Um but core is\nseem to be like a drop in to integrate\nmultiple platforms. He says I have to\nwork on tasks that are spread across\nGitHub issues uh inside linear which is\nI guess the modern Jira inside Slack\nthreads and I even get emails. So I want\nto coordinate my tasks and collate my\nwork items, you know, determine my\npriorities\n>> between all these different I the\n>> to me is like kill the other platforms,\n>> you know, but realistic from\n>> all these I mean this confluence inter\nthis this confluence integration in my\nopinion holds very little value really\nbecause because uh it becomes uh it\nbecomes read only doesn't\nYeah,\nit I mean but to to be honest um a pull\nrequest flow to make adjustments to a\ndocument is not the same as like a\nGoogle Docs shared session and co\ncollaboratively editing and proposing\nchanges. Like if you use Google Docs or\nQuip, you can highlight a section, add a\ncomment, or you can go into proposal\nmode and just delete a se a paragraph,\nrephrase it, and then the author or the\ndocument owner. Even if it's yourself,\nbut you want to keep track of the\nchanges that you're proposing can then\naccept or can discuss, which try and do\nthat on the pull request. Try\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this\nGitHub repos\nYeah. that conjures up nightmares of\npull requests, which is uh\n>> so something like I think has a purpose.\nSomething like a collaborative doc\nplatform. Confluence is horrible. I\nthink I love how Microsoft works like\nthe Google Docs.\n>> I like what you said. So, so you can\ncomment,\nedit,\nand then that and then that feeds into\num but how do how do we get from\nConfluence into uh you know,\n>> don't call it Confluence, call it\ndocumentation platform. I'm just\nallergic to Atllesian. Ah,\n>> okay. Just never mind.\n>> Okay. Doc platform. So, how how do we\nget Yeah, I don't understand how we get\nfrom there into there.\nSo, it would basically be listening to\nany dock changes\nand then and then claw code would do a a\nplan like because\nYeah. Like how is this going to work\nVincent? How is this going to work?\nI built something but I don't want to\ntalk about it. [laughter]\n>> Okay. Well, I built something that is\ndoc platform that u allows you to\ncomment on line ranges and it creates\nedit batches uh as and basically it is\nup to a human to to\nstep through an edit batch which is\nbasic basically\n>> but we iterate through the comments. you\nselect which comments you want to\naddress and which ones you want to skip.\n>> Actually, let's wind it back a bit. I'm\ngonna attack the idea of of stakeholders\nactually commenting and editing because\nin my experience\nmany stakeholders and big enterprises,\nthey're never going to edit or comment\non a on a doc platform. I'm you know\nthis is this is this is like middle\nmanagement zone if that\n>> I don't know if this is placed\nadvertisement but I think this is would\nbe interesting to attend the um packed\npublishing workshop on specd driven\ndevelopment with ko where they talk\nabout writing specifications\nand collaborating on and and basically\nit's from an AWS principal engineer and\nhe talks about how AWS manages these\ndocuments\n>> you understand Uh\n>> I think I think that's why I would go to\nthat workshop because it's not just\nabout specdriven development but also\nthe aspect of how does AWS approach this\ndocument approach and how does it flow\ninto a specification that then is uh\nworked on in KO.\n>> Yeah,\n>> that that is the step that is that is\nbasically this right how do I get from a\ndoc to to cloud code to whatever is my\num agent shell. Um,\n>> yeah. Yeah, it be interesting though the\nI mean I think Amazon is probably\nthere's definitely some people who are\ndoing cool things in Amazon, but it\ndoesn't seem to show, you know what I\nmean? Like\n>> Yeah. No, but like I also um\nAmazon uses a dock platform before it\ngoes into KO, right? And\nmaybe these are, you know, pro processes\nthat have been so long in place that,\nyou know, you can't just overnight\nreplace because of AI is now in the mix.\n>> And so most of the effort is like, how\ndo I get AI in the loop on all of these\nother processes, you know, we're we're\nalways thinking about letting AI do the\nwork and keeping the human in the loop,\nbut in a lot of these scenarios, and I\nread this from a LinkedIn post, um, you\nneed to look at it from how to get AI in\nthe loop, right? What's your question is\ncloud go there is AI how do I get AI in\nthe loop\n>> I like this loop I think is important\nbecause even if we make integrations\nhere\nthe stakeholders really need to be here\nto see what's AI is is spitting back at\nthem otherwise they're going to be out\nof the loop right\n>> uh\n>> like how do how do we create a loop here\nthere need there needs to be a loop uh\nas you as you said\nyou know what I'm saying like you we\nmight form this hero or whatever.\nWe might be able to connect the dots,\nbut if the if if the loop isn't uh you\nknow, if if this isn't going if this if\nthis loop isn't isn't like super fast,\nthen the whole thing breaks down. This\nis why, you know, claw code in a\nterminal is such a fantastic experience\nis because you you're there in with the\ncode\nand uh you're looping so so so quickly\nwith each person of the key.\nBut doesn't that go offline? Like\nI I think it has a it has a benefit to\nhave cloud in at the meeting table\nsaying like oh by the way guys think\nabout these different ways that you\ncould address this. Um but doesn't it go\ngo from we have a discussion either on a\ndocument either in a in a in a call or\nin a meeting room and we based on that\ndiscussion we have highlighted sections\nthat need to we rework and then somebody\ntakes that offline basically with cloud\ncode and and iterates through some of\nthese proposals and makes decisions and\nthen those reisions result in in changes\nto the document and a new version of the\ndocument is published. Um then overview\nit.\n>> Yes. And you say that's too slow because\nyou get a very fast feedback loop with\ncloud code. But I feel it is not\nproductive to have everyone at the table\nfor those individual iterations.\n>> Okay. So so basically let me just\nnow I'm really talking about what I've\nbuilt. [laughter]\n>> So essentially\n>> because I spent one week like se five\ndays on on on this on this idea.\nSo the so basically it goes back into\nthe document.\nUm\n>> I think you you you can just the the\narea above arrow above can go back into\nthe document\n>> anyway. No. Yeah.\n>> And then it goes\nYeah. I still think this is going to be\ntoo slow.\n>> Yeah. [clears throat]\n[snorts] or just\nI mean there is a there's surely sign\nsome scientific uh\n>> too slow compared to what to reality to\ntoday.\n>> Well like\n>> because today it's way slower. There's a\nthere's a law of you know the more\npeople you add to a project the more\ncommunication overhead you have and I\nfeel I feel like you know even though I\nput one person here in reality there's a\nwhole team there could be like 10 people\nhere that we have to like\nreach alignment with and the\nstakeholders there could be another\nanother you know three or four\nstakeholders or whatever\nthere could be\nthe this.\nYeah, just just reaching alignment is\ngoing to be so challenging here.\n>> There was a human caterpillar. Oh, what?\nThe human uh\nfor a while. [laughter]\nNever mind.\n>> This is going to be nuts. This is going\nto be nuts.\n>> Yeah. So, um I'm actually been like\nopening threads like crazy to see how\npeople and I think one of the\ninteresting organizations working on\nthis is human layers. They did a a\npresentation where they heavily\nreferenced Steve Jagis beats project as\nwell and talking about um you know at\nwhat at what stage you have um brain rot\nhow do they call it? So, so because of\nthe I think they they say at the 30% 40%\nmark, if you only have 40% left of uh\nunused context, that's where you are in\nthe non-productive zone of your context\nwindow. And so he he highlights it's\ncalled um the the talk is called harness\nengineering and we can link it um later\nbut he talks about how to control that\ncontext and common mistakes and um this\nrelates to this I'm I'm sure because it\ntalks about how you get the context um\nand how you you know how you optimize\nyour workflow. Basically, human layers\ndoes a lot of effort there. At the end\nof of of his talk, he talks about if you\nlike what what I've talked about, go\ncheck out human layers. Um, in terms of\nlike how do we, you know, interact and\nintegrate this um this LM\n>> human layers is some software then like\nso I just I'm startup.\n>> Well, I really like that thing that we\nwere talking about over over WhatsApp. I\nmean everyone's going crazy about that\nthat that sort of uh I keep on it's got\nsuch an in memorable name that that tool\nthat which basically prompts you what is\nthe name of it again?\n>> Ask user tool.\n>> Yeah, ask ask user tool. How about this?\nI'm just riffing here.\nBut say you're working with AI,\nthe ask user tool\nsends a message to to each of the sort\nof stakeholders, the middle managers or\nsomething like that and and ask them to\nagree on this certain thing and then all\nthey need to press is like enter and\nthen they move on to the next thing and\nthen enter move on to next thing and if\nif they don't so basically it's like\nsome sort of democracy because you know\nstakeholder A and B might answer\nsomething option one but stakeholder uh\nuh C might option might say option two\nor something. So we need some sort of\nlike democracy type or you know or get\nget into some uh ubi no ubiquitous what\ndo you call it when unanimous decision\nabout a certainity thing.\n>> Not unanimous I think it's majority.\n>> Well yeah that's democracy but in\nreality you want unanimous but you want\neveryone to agree.\n>> You're right. You're right. You're\nright. I did.\n>> Um,\n>> but this is this is the thing that's\nmissing cuz like we we jump in and and\nand and chat with Claude and it's like\nsome sort of like mindmeld.\n>> Okay. So, what exists\n>> social paradise but in reality there's\nloads of stakeholders.\n>> Okay. So, what exists today is you have\ntools like warp terminal that do not\nhave a single Okay. what you're talking\nabout seems to be like um there's this\ntool that you can uh share your shell\nand then you can have other people on\nthe same shell. You know this one?\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can do that\nwith T-Max.\n>> Yeah. You can do I think it's it's\nbasically a wraparound T-max that that\nallows people to connect and have\nmultiple cursors and even\ncollaboratively edit in a shell. Um\nso\nand there's a lot of really cool stuff\nusing T-Max around agent that uh around\nagents also but anyway today warp\nterminal has the concept of an\nindividual session that you have with\ncloud code that you can then after you\nsubmit the code share that session right\num so you you get the link of that\nsession um so you have the full context\nof how that code ended up to be what it\nwas But and another thing is open code\nalso has this feature. So open code they\nhave a server site that you can um I\nthink it's private. You can as an\nenterprise subscribe but open code by\ndefault. Open code is basically a cloud\nopen source cloud code version.\n>> Yeah. I I tried it the other day. I was\n>> I love it.\n>> I've been playing on it a lot now.\n>> But does does it have an ask user tool?\nSo I I linked to you the the proposal.\nThere's like two or three people do the\nPR to add it in, but they're adding in\nit into the core. So the reason why I\nbring up open code and warp terminal and\nsharing sessions is because what you're\nproposing is like an ask group tool\nwhich is like sending you know maybe\nwith with some type of team uh shell\nsharing like um you know asking everyone\nin the group to to respond.\n>> I mean I'm not sure team sharing is\ngoing to work because the way T-Max\nworks you share the same window, right?\n>> Right. So, so everyone would need to\nanswer the same questions. But what I\nwant to say is open code has like three\nor four PRs open to ask to add the ask\nuser tool into open code because it's\nlike one of the highly requested\nfeatures. But instead of adding it to\nthe core because apparently open code um\nalso has like a web app um environment\nlike the the terminal user interface is\njust one of the interfaces that you can\nuse with open code. So they don't want\nthe ask user tool to be tightly coupled\nto the core and tied to this terminal\nuser interface interaction because then\nit doesn't really work well across all\nthe other interfaces that they expose\nwhich to me things there could be a\ncollaborative document type of interface\non top of of of open code as well right\nbut to solve the problem they're adding\na new kind of user interaction model\ninto the core of open code that means\nanyone can then implement ask user tool\nas a plug-in so the core supports\nyour plugin to define like rich model\ninteractions like open a tapped\ninterface provide options and and with\nwith up and down. So I think that's\namazing. Um and that's only because it's\nopen source.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So we can build something like\nthis, right? But like but like let's go\ninto the nitty nitty diddy details. Do\nyou think it should be unanimous? Do you\nthink this like say there's three\nstakeholders in a project? Do you think\ndo you think they they can come to\nunanimous decision or they should\n>> Sounds like\n[snorts]\n>> everyone raise their hand at the same\ntime and if you don't agree then the\nperson that don't agree with the\nmajority has to explain why and then you\nhave to all raise your hands again\non the\n>> Yeah, that sounds like a really good\nagile exercise, isn't it?\n>> I have no idea what agile is.\n>> Planning poker. I I've never heard of\nit.\n>> Yes. You never you don't know planning\npoker.\n>> Where does it come?\n>> You need to use Fibonacci numbers.\nThat's all I remember. Or t-shirt size\nfrom poker.\n>> Yeah. So the idea is that that you\ndiscuss about uh a feature and then you\nhave to estimate the size story points\nbasically.\n>> Oh yeah. But that's not I mean\nestimating that that's the trouble with\num with AI like does it make sense to to\nestimate a story anymore? No, we're not\ntalking about that. We're talking about\nthe the process of planning poker,\nright? So, the process of planning poker\nis you're in a group, there's a feature\nand people need to agree, need to align.\nAnd your problem is\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, it's an alignment\ntool.\n>> Yeah. Planning ping poker in the process\nof planning poker there's an alignment\nproc there's an aligning concept because\neverybody the way is like you raise up\nyour hands. uh you're not supposed to\nlike look at each other. You have to\nmake a decision and and and you know\n>> Yeah. Some people use t-shirt sizes,\nsome people use numbers, but if you use\nnumbers, it's like Fibonacci Fibonacci\nsequence to make sure that it's not too\nlike if you have a a gradual number\nrange, people always go for the middle.\nBut if you have Fibonacci numbers, it's\nmore like um I read a lot about this a\nlong time ago. I don't remember.\n>> Yeah, I' I've played this game. I've\nplayed this game.\n>> Yeah. But but I mean if coming back to\nyour original question about finding a\nunonymous or or\n>> Yeah, I think it's a good I think I\nthink it's a good suggestion. I really I\nreally do actually. Um\n>> yeah,\n>> there's lots of there's lots of tool I\nthink there's there's like Jirro plugins\nto to to do what you just described. So\nwe we need we need an ask user tool\nplanning planning poker\n>> ask group tool\n>> and we and we need plugin\n>> and I need it planning poker I need it\nimplemented by um Monday. So see you see\nyou then then Vincent.\n>> So first off the open code PRs you could\nyou could look at open code and take\nthese PRs and and but then it goes into\ncore. So the reality is that open code\nsays this is a highly requested feature\nand we're going to build these nice UI\num you know functionality directly into\nthe core so that plugins can build\nreally interactive um you know models\nthen imagine that that plugins but still\nI think the plug-in system with open\ncode will be on a single user interface\nit won't be something that goes over\nacross a server with websockets that\nthen updates everyone's screen like hey\nhere are here's the next question here\nare five options\nWhich one do you pick?\n>> You build it like beads and then you can\nhave your your your crazy UI on top of\nit, right?\n>> Yeah. So, for me, I the way I I I solved\nit in in the thing that I've been\nbuilding, it's um it's more of an\noffline flow. It's like one of the\npersons goes and evaluates all the\noptions and then the system keeps track\nof what they received.\n>> Actually, that brings me sorry to to\nslight tangent. beads. Surely beads\ncould maybe incorporate some sort of\noption to to refine the uh the story or\nsomething like that or\n>> but it to be honest beads is more of the\nthe the actual task markup than getting\nto the Yeah, you're right. Okay. And I\nthink it's good to um isolate this\nbecause that's where I love beats\nbecause it fits perfectly in my process\nor any process that I choose to use for\nme right now individually going through\nthe you know research plan implement\nphases which I do with specit but\nthere's openspec there's spec cli\nthere's like a 100 different\nimplementations of specdriven\ndevelopment under the sun so beats is\nperfect because it doesn't concern\nitself with however you get to those\ntasks right Okay, so let's just\nhypothetically imagine that\nthis is working. Stakeholders are\nagreeing,\nbeads are created, beads are executed on\nand then something is built, right?\nUm then what happens then? Is there some\nsort of accepting testing? Is there\nlike how do we get the stakeholder cuz\nlike this is another sort of\ncommunication issue whereby like you\nknow you and I we would we would plan\nsomething then we would create the beads\nand then we would you know BD ready get\nthe agent to to implement it but and\nthen we would have to like uh review the\ncode and check everything is looking\ngreat\n>> and then and then and then and then and\nthen test the product and then and then\ndeliver the product and then\n>> I think there you're you're you're first\nof forgetting some of the agile\nprinciples, right? Which is build a\nminimal first to get user feedback\nquickly. We all know that whatever the\nuser agrees to is not really what they\nwant until they see it.\n>> Oh, okay. So then we're going we're\ngoing back to an MVP.\n>> Yes. And and this is one of the\ntakeaways that like people say when they\nwork with AI is that you don't create\nmock-ups or you don't come with a design\nspecification with AI. You come with an\nMVP. You actually implement it and you\nlet people play with it.\n>> Um because it goes so fast. So So we\nneed when we do these planning poker,\nwe're talking about like small sprint\ntype of things and we need the\nacceptance criteria aside from all\nagreeing that this is what we want to\nbuild. We need to get an MVP. We and\nthis is the great thing about specit by\nthe way when when I do a feature\ndefinition it's always going to identify\nthe MVP of like what is the smallest\ntype of features that I need to to to\nthat I can show to someone for the\ninitial like UX feel of it um and I\nthink that's great uh in in these tools\num like\nlet's let's role play here so let's just\nsay like oh here's this MVP uh check it\nout on localhost\nuh 8,000.\nUm so they they check it out and then\nthen what happens then there's new\nrequirements like ah actually this\nshould say um you should say food\ninstead of bar and then and then it it\nat this point it engages Claude again\nbecause like especially I'm just\nthinking aloud for like UI based uh web\nbased things like Claude probably\ndoesn't even know what the render looks\nlike or something like that or you know\nlike I'm just I'm just thinking there's\ngoing to be there's going to be new\nchallenges here to engage with the argu\nI you mean this this is this is the this\nis a planning tool but like but we need\nanother tool to facilitate the\niterations once the MVP is built or\nwouldn't you or maybe I'm just\ncomplicating\n>> no I think that's where we need to just\nfall back to existing processes because\nyour session your cloud session of this\nplanning session is gone, right? That's\nthat's an ephemeral shortlived session.\nYou have some output artifacts that you\nyou either, you know, that you fed into\nbecause I think there's still a very\n>> So [clears throat] you I think I know\nwhat you're saying. You're going to you\njust start again. You you you throw away\nthe MVP\nand then you you start you start from\nscratch or something. Is that what\nyou're saying?\n>> It depends. Um it depends how what what\nwhat you want to do with the MVP. If you\nif you're an enterprise and you can\nspend $1,000 on on on on cloud tokens, I\nthink you can throw away and or generate\nfive different MVPs. Me personally, if\nif I spend a weekly budget of 20 dollars\na month on my on my MVP, I don't really\nwant to throw it away.\nOkay, so let's imagine now that we\nstarted from scratch, we used a whole\nbunch of tokens and now we have\nsomething that that the three\nstakeholders\nare happy with.\num isn't there going to be a question of\nmaintainability like\nor uh\n>> so this is where I feel the the idea of\nmaintainability of software is going to\nchange significantly because and I think\nbe uh Steve also says this very nicely\nwhen he talks about beats he says I\ncreated in October so what three months\nand it has thousands of users right now\nI have never looked at the code I've not\nlooked at the code and if you look at\nbut I think he's exaggerating\nAnd if you look at Gast Town, he says he\ngives like a bunch of caveats. It's\ngoing to cost you a lot of money. It's\ngoing to cost you an arm and a leg. It's\ngoing to be insane if you're not at\nstage seven of AI adoption. He he makes\na diagram of like um you know people\nthat um that use AI.\n>> Is that in his in his blog? I didn't\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Very nice diagram of like\nthe level of AI adoption. And then he he\nasks are you at the stage where you\nlearn run at least five different\nheadless cloud sessions? If you're not,\nthen this is not for you. Yeah, [snorts]\nthat one. So, figure one is\num\nzero or near zero. So, you don't use\nfigure two is AI is doing proposals. You\nsay yes, no, and you adopt Exactly.\n>> Okay, we've been talking about this,\n>> right? Figure three is you go yolo mode\nwith the agent completely managing your\ncode and you are still looking at the\ncode. Figure four I forgot what's the\nfigure the difference between three and\nfour but clearly the code is less\nimportant. Figure five is you're fully\nin the terminal with one cloud session.\nFigure six is you are in the ter like\nmultiple cloud sessions and figure seven\nis like guest town is if you're at\nfigure seven or eight you have like a a\nsignificant amount of parallel cloud\nsessions running. He explains them in in\nuh in the blog uh below. I\n>> I uh I haven't got through the blog, but\nyeah. So, this makes me think we've been\ntalking about this at length and but\nlike at at this point we're only on\nstage two and it feels like we're a\nlittle bit behind\n>> each and everyone individual right I'm\nI'm pretty much as figure five. I'm\nhaving I'm usually running a single\ncloud session and I don't look at the\ncode. This is why and you say it's going\nto create a problem with code\nmaintainability. I believe that docs\nfirst\num integration test or end to end\nplayright is your validation of the\ndocs. So these are always a sync. If\nthey're not then you have a problem and\nthen your code. You may want to run some\nsecurity of defec ops agents to identify\nvulnerabilities and things like that and\nsome well architecture reviews of your\ncode but personally you will not like\nyou know you only look at it at a high\nlevel architecture and you put your\nobservability around it. You look at\nyour memory usage and you basically\nidentify bottlenecks and you only\nrefactor when needed like no pre\npremature optimization. Anytime you look\nat the code it's premature optimization\nlike you should just you know trust the\nprocess.\nI think so. And and you you trust that\nyour docs and integration tests catch\nany regressions. So you can say, \"Hey, I\nwant to change this whole feature and\nthen uh or I add a new feature.\" And\nthen you can just run the thing and it\ngoes like, \"Yep, all of the existing\nuser stories still work. You're good to\ngo.\" And we have a new one and it's\nfully covered by integration tests.\n>> Wow, man. This the future that we're\nheading in is really crazy. But like\ntake beads for example. Say\nSay Steve decided like I'm not looking\nat the code and I wanted to reimplement\nagain. Um I'm assuming beat has some\nsort of test harness or something like\nthat. And that's where that's where it's\nsuper important like what the whole\nthing I said, right? You need to have at\nleast\na um you know a quick feedback loop for\nyour AI when it makes a change to know\nthat like oops I broke you know all of\nthis other stuff that's suddenly block\nthe integration tests are not working.\nBut I'm happy to say that I don't see\ncloud going and saying oop this test\nisn't doesn't\n>> I'm happy to say that cloud doesn't go\nlike oh this is a pre-existing issue let\nme disable the test which it used to do\nlike a month ago.\n>> Well this doesn't in my experience it\nwill just change the test.\n>> No no it doesn't. So that's where I I do\nlook at the diff on my test\n>> because that's a trouble with tests like\nthe tests can encode a lot of\nassumptions and things like that.\n>> Yeah. So I just I just did the whole\nthing um which is like a dock platform\nwith LLM prompt for cloud ask user tool.\nSo that's the thing I built is is\nbasically tracking content going into an\ncloud session with user tool to make\nchanges to and then check it back in. So\nyou have the the that's what I built and\nI just realized that it assumes the\nserver processes access to the files on\nlocal disk and I'm like hold on a minute\nthe do platform doesn't run on the CLI\nyou know the client side so it doesn't\nhave access to the disk so so the whole\ndesign I totally missed um the fact that\nthe client needs to send the content to\nthe doc platform for to make changes and\nso all of my integration tests are\npassing because it is running within the\nsame workspace. So when the server gets\na request, it just reads the file from\nthe workspace instead of it running in a\nseparate one. So right now I'm doing a\nmassive refactor saying like okay create\na whole new set of integration tests\nwhere the server process runs in a\ndifferent folder and to make sure\nthere's no case where um you know so\nthere's no way that that that the server\ncan you know modify a file locally\nthinking that the client changes have\nnot been persisted. So, so yes, the you\nneed to look at those integration tests.\nYou need to you need to look at the\ndocumentation and you need to look at\nthe integration test and I also ask\n>> code the tests are part of the code,\nright? I'm just I'm just thinking aloud\nhere. Yeah, there's there's no way of\ngetting around. Yeah. So that's another\ncomment I got is um some systems are so\ncomplex multi microser and all that and\nso this is very hard of a of a workflow\nto implement over these complex systems\nif you don't if you cannot spin up a\nwhole integration testing environment.\nTo me the integration testing is the\nonly place you or like even the\nendto-end testing is the only place you\ncan actually do um validate that that\nthings work and then you\nexisting systems are not built for this\nright existing systems heavily rely on\nmanual verification of QA um and and are\nway too complex to to build a whole\nintegration testing environment but if\nyou're building something new\n>> I just thinking allow just to put just\nto put the tests in the code is kind of\ndangerous um they kind of need to be\nseparated just for safety almost.\n>> No, I don't think so. I prefer what I\nlike right now I I I've done four or\nfive projects where I use specit\ndevelopment specit driven development\nand beats and I go for a full monor repo\neverything like side by side and it's\nperfect because cloud can go yeah\n>> and directly see hey my API is here my\nprotocol definitions are here my\nintegration testing are there and and I\nneed to go full stack like I need to go\nand change my my my um my protoraph\n>> okay so say we have some in end to- end\ntests. I mean, normally in the modern\nworld, this would look like some,\nyou know, most most uh pieces of\nsoftware end up being a web page or or\nan iOS app or something.\n>> Mhm.\n>> And and let's be honest, doing end\nto-end tests on the web is still or or\nor on mobile still a pain in the ass.\nIt's going to be quite manual, isn't it?\nNo, I I mean for the web app that I\nbuilt, I use Playright. I never used\nPlayright in my life, but cloud code\nwrote the scripts and I I manually\nverify it and I know it works. If it\ndoesn't, I say, \"Hey, the playright is\nnot covering this.\" And it goes and and\nfixes it. It says now the play is\nfailing.\n>> My like it works in trivial cases, but\nin like big enterprise, if you ran\nplayright over in an Atlassian estate,\nit would consume a billion tokens and\nexplode and\n>> No, no, no. Not playright MCP. Okay.\nAbsolutely not Playright MCP. Playright\nthe actual test harness.\nThis is what I hate about the Playright\nMCP is like this. They seem to assume\nthat you want the LLM to drive it and\nspend a billion tokens to go through the\nprocess.\n>> Okay. You need to show me your usage of\nplayright. But I still I'm still\n>> playright. If this is what we're going\nto rely on to make sure that we're\ndelivering something that works, I'm a\nbit nervous about this.\n>> And that's that's reality today that so\nmany organizations don't have a proper\nfirst off database seeding mechanism or\nability to even create a full\nintegration environment for integration\ntesting and then they don't have fully\nautomated end to like end toend testing\nscripts. But if you write playright end\nto end testing scripts, it actually\ndoesn't need an LLM to drive. Now go\nclick on this button. Let me take a\nscreenshot. Oh no, no, no, wait for this\nbutton to appear. And then the LLM is\ndoing that. That's insane. That's\nstupid. Playright has a scripting\nengine. You can say in this particular\ntest case, we're going to, you know,\nwe're going to click on the login\nbutton. It's going to redirect us to\nKeycloak for enterprise login. So we\nwait for the key logo to to appear, the\nlogin to appear. uh we then log in with\nour click click credentials for our\nintegration testing environment which is\nbootstrapped by the way during the setup\nphase. So I have a unique set of\ncredentials to use during my end to end\nintegration testing.\n>> Doing credentials flow is going to be a\ntotal pain.\n>> Yeah. But that's why you need to build\nthese systems with automation in mind.\nSo so that that's real. It's true. I I\njoin many companies and they're like oh\nwe don't know how to do our things and\nwe want to have an integration testing\nenvironment. And I'm like great. Yeah, I\ncan I can do that. And then like okay,\nhow do you bootstrap user accounts? How\ndo you set up this and that? And nothing\ncan be automated. Well, maybe I'm\ntalkingual failed career, but like I\nhave implemented a few integration tests\nin my life, but they just tend to be so\nexpensive and hard to maintain and you\nyou make one or two\n>> and then you know how it works, but then\nyou know you move on to another team or\nyou\n>> But the great thing about LLMs is that\nthey like I never wrote a playright\nscript in my life, but the agent knows\nand then it just works and then it\nactually runs and when you go into the\nplayright studio, whatever the thing is\ncalled that shows up the UI when you\nwhen you run it in UI mode. It actually\nyou can see every single step like you\nsee the screen.\n>> Okay, you need to show this to me. But\nanyway, I think I think we're\n>> but the thing is that you get a full LLM\ncontext. Now this playright UI has a\nrightclick button, copy error, copy\nprompt, and you can prompt it. It says\nwe're in the playright test suite. This\nis the step we're at. This is the error\nthat the browser console is showing.\nThis is what we saw in the previous step\nand you don't need an LLM to drive.\n>> Okay. In the next video, you need to\nshow me playright working as you've just\ndescribed.\n>> You don't believe me?\n>> I don't believe you. But but I want to\nbelieve to be honest. Okay, let's let's\nwind up.\n>> I know that your comment is going to be\nit's a trivial system that you're doing\nthis on. I showed it to you before. I\nthink I showed you the grit uh you login\nflow.\n>> Okay, so next is a focus on this. Let me\nsee if I can highlight it. Okay, cool. I\nneed to get on with my day. I'm sure you\ndo, too.\n>> You don't believe me. I'm tell I'm I'm\ntelling you I agree with you that today\nthe systems that the way that they're\nwritten and the way that humans have to\nmaintain these things, they tend to run\nout of sync. But I feel I have a very\nstrong feeling that with the LLM and the\ncapabilities of the LLM, the LLM takes\non ownership on a lot of these\ncomponents and the users are just there\nto validate. And it's pretty much what\nGasttown is saying as well. The human\nrole is reduced to an overseer. We just\nvalidate the process.\n>> The validate like we I thought we were\njust discussing that the validation can\nbe automated and enter.\n>> No, the human validates the validation.\n>> All right. I um anyway I wanted to talk\nto anyone who's listening to please uh\nrate the podcast\ncomment in the YouTube email\nhow do people reach you Vincent\n>> uh reach me\n>> don't say LinkedIn\n>> I I watch the comments sometimes so if\nthere's a comment I will I will respond\n>> wow man\n>> I don't know you're a man of the people.\n[laughter] I I will sometimes look at\nwhat you have to say, but otherwise I\ndon't care.\n>> No, no, I do. I do. I go care. How do\nthey reach me? You're like, \"What?\"\n>> Do you have any like You can email me at\nhenry.fe, for example, and tell me that\nI'm wrong or you have a better idea.\n>> Okay. Uh, you can\nGod, this is so hard with you, Vincent.\nHonestly,\n>> can't really reach me. No.\n>> [laughter]\n>> Okay. Well,\n>> you can even and Kai and then Kai can\ntell me if somebody says that I was\ntotally wrong that play right doesn't\nwork the way I say it does.\n>> Cool, man. Anyway, it's uh Oh, we didn't\nYeah. Okay. We couldn't cover\neverything. This is crazy. Loving it.\nOkay. See you guys. Bye.",

I got I got\n[0:10] Claude installed here. The The two\n[0:13] things that I worked on was I might have\n[0:16] worked on this\n[0:17] >> in the top one. It was the Pi.\n[0:19] >> Yeah. But there's also this um I think I\n[0:22] mentioned this to you before. I don't I\n[0:25] sort of vibe coded this not even with\n[0:29] beads I think with Gemini and and\n[0:32] conductor.\n[0:34] >> Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you tried\n[0:35] out conductor.\n[0:37] >> I'm very excited to hear what\n[0:38] >> I don't know. I think\n[0:42] I thought it did a really good job like\n[0:44] all the stuff here. Um\n[0:47] >> have you gone through the whole specket\n[0:48] as well just as an\n[0:50] >> or have you only tried? I think I've\n[0:52] tried it, but like I I felt I felt the\n[0:54] conductor experience was a little bit\n[0:56] more streamlined. Yeah.\n[0:58] >> To be honest, I don't know exactly what\n[1:01] these archives. I think tracks are I\n[1:04] think you mentioned it before.\n[1:05] >> It's it's the it's like the specs\n[1:07] basically.\n[1:08] >> Yeah. So, I think I think if you looked\n[1:10] in here, you can do some archeology\n[1:12] archology. Archology\n[1:15] and you can work out what I did. But I\n[1:17] thought it was quite a smooth process. M\n[1:21] >> of course the I mean is what this thing\n[1:24] is is just a a very simple uh\n[1:29] uh\n[1:31] Chrome extension. It did seem like but I\n[1:34] guess this is maybe normal. You know it\n[1:36] did seem like we're generating 50 files\n[1:38] to do like one tiny little piece of\n[1:41] JavaScript. Um but you know I guess\n[1:43] that's just normal. I mean the I mean\n[1:46] what and God knows how many tokens. It's\n[1:48] like it's basically 100 lines of code\n[1:51] for basically a lot of a lot of uh\n[1:54] bureaucracy in some ways. Do you\n[1:56] >> have Yeah, these systems like conductor\n[1:59] >> it's saving my screenshots. Ah, that's\n[2:01] really cool cuz I was going like ah this\n[2:03] is not working.\n[2:04] >> Oh, it has a Oh, wow. It stores. Okay,\n[2:06] so cloud code does the same thing but it\n[2:08] shows it stores your images in your home\n[2:11] directory.\n[2:12] H\n[2:14] so\n[2:16] I don't know if it ever yeah see so the\n[2:18] end result here it says age four months\n[2:20] ago but the problem is that is that\n[2:23] Amazon is like sometimes having this\n[2:26] information sometimes isn't but there is\n[2:28] a I did figure out there's a shorefire\n[2:30] way of figuring out the the age and\n[2:32] that's to load that that AI Roffus\n[2:36] >> and then you ask the AI Roffus what how\n[2:39] old is the product and it will tell you\n[2:41] so It's almost like the whole extension\n[2:43] doesn't need to exist. You could\n[2:45] >> cuz you see it right there at the top of\n[2:46] the bar.\n[2:47] >> You could just uh talk to Rufus, but\n[2:49] unfortunately that's not programmatic.\n[2:53] >> Oh, so wait, Rufus is an Amazon thing.\n[2:55] That's always\n[2:55] >> there like an AI thing.\n[2:57] >> Okay. And then the other thing I wanted\n[2:58] to show you was that yeah I so this was\n[3:01] an I think this is actually I told you\n[3:04] the thought experiment would be instead\n[3:07] of using anible to to basically\n[3:10] administer this thing which it was\n[3:12] before uh\n[3:15] it was some anible crap and then I\n[3:19] thought to myself hey I'm not going to\n[3:20] use anible I'm going to use um\n[3:24] uh claude to admin to set this thing up\n[3:26] and it did work. But the trouble is\n[3:28] again is that it's quite a simple setup\n[3:32] and I almost think there's more markdown\n[3:34] than there was there was there's more\n[3:36] markdown now than there was in uh in\n[3:38] anible YAML\n[3:41] [laughter]\n[3:42] and I'm just thinking to myself and then\n[3:44] of course if I had to set this up from\n[3:46] scratch which I'm don't really have the\n[3:48] u the uh the goal the I I don't really\n[3:53] have the u the time to do it to SC to to\n[3:57] set up app from scratch using this\n[4:00] readme. I don't think it will be able to\n[4:02] do it. I mean I'm not confident it will\n[4:04] be able to do it but but but if I used\n[4:06] anible\n[4:08] then I know it would there would be some\n[4:10] you know reproducibility there and I I\n[4:12] know there would be some some tests\n[4:14] there. So so basically I learned a\n[4:18] lesson that that you know things like\n[4:20] anible are definitely not going away.\n[4:24] uh you need the anible to sort of\n[4:28] uh just just to run reproducibly and\n[4:31] then you you use AI you can't use AI to\n[4:35] administer and set up a machine you\n[4:36] because it's just not reproducible. I\n[4:38] mean it's it's obvious in retrospect but\n[4:40] I got I have to remind myself what\n[4:43] people say is like the ELLMs are the new\n[4:45] click ops. They're doing things and they\n[4:49] you know are not reproducible. But I see\n[4:53] you use beats for this particular task.\n[4:55] Did you need more than one session? Did\n[4:57] it require a big context that you needed\n[5:00] to use beats?\n[5:01] >> It did. It did, but I got a bit\n[5:03] sidelined with things. It's It's almost\n[5:06] like being a human with the AI.\n[5:10] Well, I got sidelined because there was\n[5:12] there was a networking issue. Um\n[5:15] >> Yeah, that can really mess up.\n[5:16] >> And the trouble the trouble is the\n[5:18] networking issue wasn't really down to\n[5:20] the the Pi. it was down to my ubiquity\n[5:23] setup and my ubiquity setup is a bit\n[5:27] complicated.\n[5:28] Um, so basically it was it was fighting\n[5:32] it all its assumptions about how the\n[5:35] network should work were not really\n[5:36] working very well because I had a I had\n[5:38] a screw up in my ubiquity thing and and\n[5:41] it was just crazy. So that's kind of\n[5:44] dumb. But I I wanted to show you that my\n[5:47] home setup. I think you might be\n[5:49] marginally impressed by this.\n[5:52] Uh let me just stop sharing. I'm so good\n[5:55] at this. Here we go.\n[5:58] >> Yeah.\n[5:59] >> Okay.\n[5:59] >> I need I need to install Ghosty on my\n[6:01] Mac. I use it on my Arch, by the way,\n[6:03] but I don't use it on my Mac.\n[6:06] >> Okay. So, this is where you might be\n[6:10] impressed.\n[6:14] Have you ever played with uh machinectl\n[6:16] or systemd uh endspawn?\n[6:20] >> Endspawn. All right. Um only through\n[6:23] rocket from core o. So that's a very\n[6:26] long time.\n[6:27] >> I mean I could I could get these I could\n[6:29] get it running a little bit quicker than\n[6:30] I am doing now. But like for example\n[6:33] I have an IP range pointing to my Pi. So\n[6:36] this is why the networking is a bit\n[6:39] confusing.\n[6:40] >> So you make like a flat network. you you\n[6:42] give them you allocate the range to the\n[6:45] pi so that the containers\n[6:47] >> so basically basically I can I can make\n[6:49] this a little bit faster but I'm just\n[6:50] debooting debootstrapping from absolute\n[6:53] scratch as you can see but in the matter\n[6:56] of a few seconds\n[6:58] I can I can basically boot up a VPS on\n[7:02] uh a on a static IP is that the right\n[7:05] expression on on a standalone IP. So\n[7:07] basically this VPS\n[7:12] um\n[7:14] completely owns that IP. And I've got a\n[7:17] I've got 64 of those IPs. Well,\n[7:19] actually, I think 62 are usable, but\n[7:21] whatever.\n[7:22] >> You get the point.\n[7:24] >> So, basically, I have I I one thing that\n[7:26] I was doing with this Raspberry Pi over\n[7:29] the weekend was essentially set up uh a\n[7:33] way of spinning up VPS's just quickly.\n[7:35] So, I don't have to use Digital Ocean. I\n[7:36] can just use my Pi to\n[7:39] >> well to\n[7:40] >> How much CPU and memory does a Pi have\n[7:42] that P?\n[7:43] >> Not not a lot, but it seems fast enough\n[7:45] for what I do. I think it's like 4 GB or\n[7:47] something. [laughter]\n[7:48] >> Okay.\n[7:49] >> Something tiny.\n[7:51] >> But this VM is like um it's like what is\n[7:55] it? KVM or or\n[7:57] >> it's it's using systemd nspawn which is\n[8:00] some sort of systemd thing.\n[8:02] >> Still containers. Yeah.\n[8:03] >> Yeah. So, um I don't know there's\n[8:05] nothing nothing much running inside\n[8:07] except SSHD\n[8:10] the the setup script as you can see here\n[8:13] like um I I I download the keys from\n[8:17] GitHub you know cuz I don't know if you\n[8:19] know this trick this GitHub\n[8:21] >> yeah I do this\n[8:22] >> keys I just I just set up SSH\n[8:25] >> I throw in my my keys into the\n[8:27] authorized keys\n[8:28] >> set up my user disable password\n[8:31] authentication and all that sort of\n[8:32] stuff And then I'm in I'm in there. Um,\n[8:36] and then of course what the next thing I\n[8:38] was going to do is that I was going to\n[8:39] maybe run Docker in each one. That seems\n[8:41] to work fine. So they're all isolated.\n[8:44] So they're all isolated. I can I can run\n[8:47] my little experiments in them. Um, I\n[8:51] mean I could even like create you a VPS\n[8:53] if you wanted one in UK.\n[8:56] I could become a digital ocean, start\n[8:57] charging people five bucks a month.\n[9:02] Yes,\n[9:03] >> but the I think the specs are pretty\n[9:05] bad. Like I don't know how do I see the\n[9:06] memory?\n[9:08] >> Yeah,\n[9:10] I got 4 GB.\n[9:13] >> But it's it's it's fun though. It's fun.\n[9:15] So I'm\n[9:16] >> But this IP range is on your local\n[9:18] network. Now when you want to allocate\n[9:21] public IP addresses or are you using\n[9:23] something like tail scale or or some\n[9:26] >> these IPs are public\n[9:28] >> also? How did you get an RP range? Uh, I\n[9:31] asked my ISP very nicely and they did it\n[9:32] for me.\n[9:33] >> You paid them.\n[9:37] >> Well,\n[9:38] >> it isn't. It's not cheap. Definitely not\n[9:40] IP. Um,\n[9:41] >> it's it's part of my subscription. So,\n[9:43] for example, this this this IP I set up\n[9:46] here. Uh, which one was it? I I think I\n[9:50] What is my host name here?\n[9:53] >> Uh, you want me to open it again? HTTP\n[9:58] 8000.\n[10:00] Hello Vincent. Yes, I see that. Do I see\n[10:03] it on the curl\n[10:06] curl? Yes, I see H1. Hello Vincent in\n[10:09] curl.\n[10:10] >> Yeah, so you get the point. Like now I\n[10:12] have I have a whole range of I have a\n[10:14] subnet of public IPs mapped to my Pi.\n[10:17] >> So you can run some game servers.\n[10:20] >> I can do whatever you can do with 4 GB\n[10:24] of RAM.\n[10:26] Now is where you start buying pies.\n[10:30] And then but this is the thing about um\n[10:32] that I saw some people play with is\n[10:34] slicer VM from um Alexis Alice. I think\n[10:38] he he built like open fast or functions\n[10:42] as um\n[10:44] uh functions as a service. So open fast\n[10:47] is using docker under the hood to\n[10:50] basically it bootstraps your container\n[10:51] with an entry point and then when http\n[10:56] request comes in it calls your container\n[10:59] and sends the message\n[11:00] >> like systemd has all these uh things you\n[11:03] can you can set up systemd to activate a\n[11:07] service on socket or something like\n[11:10] that.\n[11:10] >> Yeah, socket activation for your\n[11:13] >> or some other little like knockk\n[11:14] knockock. It can basically spin up a\n[11:16] VPS.\n[11:18] >> So,\n[11:18] >> so what you're saying it can be kind of\n[11:19] like serverless, but not really because\n[11:22] Okay. So, what\n[11:23] >> I mean CISD is is its own set of\n[11:26] features and tools, but it's very\n[11:27] comprehensive. Um, and you can do things\n[11:30] like I showed you. You can you can spin\n[11:32] up isolated VPSs for people.\n[11:35] >> It's very nice. Um, yeah, like you said,\n[11:37] but the thing is it's not really very\n[11:40] strong isolation, I think, still, right?\n[11:43] Uh that's where people are like\n[11:44] >> I'm not I would have to research that. I\n[11:46] mean that's one of the things I find a\n[11:48] big of a a bit of a t isn't a taboo in\n[11:52] our industry but like isolation\n[11:56] >> is one of those things that always comes\n[11:58] up. Docker never really had a a very\n[12:01] strong security stance with their\n[12:04] isolation. Right. Yeah,\n[12:05] >> a lot of and a lot of machines basically\n[12:08] assume workload isolation on on a Docker\n[12:11] host and they're just guessing, right?\n[12:15] >> Um, of course, Amazon, I think, have got\n[12:17] a more complete story with Firecracker\n[12:20] or something like that.\n[12:21] >> Yes. So, that's the thing that's\n[12:22] >> still but still I think there's some\n[12:24] people that are not a thousand%\n[12:26] convinced, right?\n[12:27] >> Mhm. Cool. So, what I did over the\n[12:31] weekend, over the weekend, over the over\n[12:33] the holidays is I\n[12:36] um I did my year in your review blog\n[12:39] post where I had a lot of fun with with\n[12:41] the cloud code. Did you did you try it?\n[12:46] >> Oh. Oh, like\n[12:47] >> Oh, that one\n[12:49] >> uh wrapped. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[12:50] >> No, no, no, no, no. I did not cloud web.\n[12:52] I did uh basically I have my landing\n[12:54] page which is pure JavaScript, JS and\n[12:58] CSS and HTML. No React, nothing because\n[13:00] I wanted maximum like speed.\n[13:02] >> Oh, okay. You should share it. I Or\n[13:05] >> no, that that that landing page I built\n[13:07] a while ago. Let me share the screen.\n[13:09] Um, hold on. I don't know how much time.\n[13:11] >> Yeah, I got to I got to run in like two\n[13:13] minutes though.\n[13:14] >> I think it's this one. Oops. Maybe.\n[13:17] Oh, [snorts] there's a lot of tabs.\n[13:20] Let's do like that. Okay. So, I'm going\n[13:23] to\n[13:24] So, this was my original landing page,\n[13:26] right? And there was no blog. Oh, wait.\n[13:28] I can't see anything. Am I blind?\n[13:30] >> What are you seeing?\n[13:31] >> Build reliable infrastructure with\n[13:33] confidence.\n[13:34] >> Yeah. So, that was the original landing\n[13:36] page without the the block. And this\n[13:39] landing page, I literally asked like\n[13:42] Codex and Gem and Gemini back in August.\n[13:44] I want SEO optimization. I explained\n[13:47] what are my keywords that I want the\n[13:48] ranking because I realized that my\n[13:51] wording was horrible. And this is what\n[13:53] it came up with. Um, and also like it\n[13:56] does really cool stuff like it uses\n[13:57] puppeteer to launch the browser, look at\n[13:59] which CSS elements are above the fault\n[14:01] and it inlines critical CSS. So it puts\n[14:04] only the CSS needed for rendering the\n[14:06] top part of the page and then the rest\n[14:08] gets loaded uh or gets loaded later. So\n[14:11] the top part render super fetch and then\n[14:13] I run all kinds of lighthouse reports\n[14:15] basically. lots of fun. And then I built\n[14:17] this thing which is like the, you know,\n[14:19] the whole tour thing where it highlights\n[14:21] different sections of the code to\n[14:23] explain.\n[14:24] >> Yeah, this I built back in September,\n[14:26] right? But this is all pure JavaScript.\n[14:29] So I I I run the synth and then I it was\n[14:32] really cool to build because these\n[14:33] things are segments. So I define a line\n[14:36] range and then it draws when it when it\n[14:39] does the I asked the codeex when you do\n[14:42] the highlight.js. I'm using highlight JS\n[14:45] here. when it renders all of the color\n[14:46] codes, the HTML elements like the divs\n[14:48] and everything that creates these\n[14:49] different colors for this code, it\n[14:52] >> creates a map of line ranges and then it\n[14:56] it basically creates a big div while\n[14:57] it's rendering everything around this\n[15:00] these HTML elements. So when you click\n[15:03] start and next, it basically this\n[15:05] element is already rendered within\n[15:07] actually look the line range is wrong\n[15:09] here. Um and then it it highlights that\n[15:11] particular div element when you you know\n[15:13] >> Yeah, I really I I do like that tour\n[15:18] idea.\n[15:19] >> Okay, I I need to go to my standup.\n[15:23] I'll have a look at your terror\n[15:24] constructor there. But but that\n[15:26] >> the block thing is on new. So I wanted\n[15:28] to keep this front page fast and this\n[15:31] whole block thing this is all react. So\n[15:34] this is much slower. But I actually have\n[15:37] a voice\n[15:40] So, I have like the whole listening of\n[15:43] this whole\n[15:44] >> I don't know if you hear the audio. Do\n[15:46] you hear the audio\n[15:47] >> when I press play?\n[15:48] >> Oh god, you went crazy, man. You went\n[15:50] crazy.\n[15:50] >> Yeah, you have like table of contents\n[15:52] with like um scroll tracking.\n[15:54] >> Yeah, I'll have a look. I have a look. I\n[15:55] need to run.\n[15:56] >> I had a lot of\n[15:57] >> Let's Let's catch up when I'm in a\n[16:01] um and let's try Yeah,\n[16:03] >> it took 10 days.\n[16:04] >> We We got We got to catch up on Steve\n[16:06] Jger stuff, too.\n[16:07] >> Yeah. I see you. You're working with\n[16:09] Gemini. Is that why?\n[16:10] >> No. No. I'm working with cloud. It has a\n[16:13] skill. It knows how to use beats. Yet\n[16:16] when I ask\n[16:16] >> get it wrong sometimes.\n[16:18] >> Yes. It's still getting it wrong. Like\n[16:19] there's still this\n[16:20] >> there was a comment\n[16:21] >> exhaustion. I guess\n[16:23] >> on one of the previous uploads to the\n[16:25] podcast to say as much actually that uh\n[16:29] that sometimes it didn't work. Let's see\n[16:31] if I can find the comment.\n[16:33] >> Yeah, there's one, right? I don't know\n[16:35] how many people are listening to us, but\n[16:38] if someone comments, that's always a\n[16:39] good sign, isn't it? Someone's actually\n[16:42] listened to us. At least some parts of\n[16:44] it. [laughter]\n[16:47] Yeah.\n[16:50] Um\n[16:53] gosh, community.\n[16:56] >> Yay. Did it right.\n[16:59] Looks better. Okay, perfect.\n[17:03] >> [snorts]\n[17:03] >> So,\n[17:05] did you ever have chance to play with\n[17:07] the Gas Town?\n[17:10] >> Not much. No, I've still I'm still\n[17:11] reading it. You know how I guess the the\n[17:15] real thing is you have to to try it out.\n[17:17] But, um,\n[17:20] Steve says that many warnings, be\n[17:23] careful. This is expensive. He runs\n[17:25] three cloud three Anttopic Pro\n[17:30] subscriptions\n[17:32] to run Gast Town. Each one I assume are\n[17:34] around $200. So it's like $600 a month\n[17:38] to to run Gast Town.\n[17:42] >> It's it's crazy. But but back to the the\n[17:44] thing, right, with with basically we\n[17:46] have a cloud skill that that's there. Um\n[17:50] we tell Beats um we give it information\n[17:53] about how to create beats issues and yet\n[17:57] it still somehow sometimes thinks that\n[18:00] when it needs to add a comment instead\n[18:02] of doing BD comment\n[18:05] add it runs BD comment add without the s\n[18:09] and then there's an alias beats have\n[18:12] both it has beat beats comments add or\n[18:16] an alias for comments ad is BD comment,\n[18:19] but there's no BD comment ad. And and\n[18:21] and actually it's funny because Steve\n[18:24] says that um you know this um picture of\n[18:27] when you look at the park in a city and\n[18:29] the the city planning decides that there\n[18:31] should be roads here and here, but then\n[18:33] actually when people walk to work and to\n[18:35] school and everywhere, they like walk\n[18:37] across the park.\n[18:38] >> We call them car paths. Yeah.\n[18:40] >> Yeah. So basic basically it's a very um\n[18:44] interesting design, right? where that's\n[18:47] >> and he he says you should treat the LLM\n[18:49] hallucinations as such. So if it\n[18:51] delucinates something, you should\n[18:52] implement it. So next time, you know, it\n[18:54] has all the options. [laughter]\n[18:55] >> It's crazy.\n[18:57] >> It one thing I find remarkable about\n[18:59] using AI is that it it does like behave\n[19:02] like a human. Like it does it trips up\n[19:04] in the same way. Absolutely. It's it's\n[19:06] crazy. It's just like\n[19:08] >> so people who've designed some software,\n[19:12] other humans must have tripped up at the\n[19:14] same point. So I find it like an amazing\n[19:17] way of now validating some a design\n[19:21] because if AI can't figure it out, the\n[19:23] humans are not going to figure it out,\n[19:24] right?\n[19:25] >> Yeah. Absolutely. Uh and I thought so\n[19:27] I'm doing this in a context where I\n[19:29] already did a significant amount of of\n[19:31] like research and refactoring because I\n[19:34] already explained some information about\n[19:36] how to create and use beats. Um\n[19:38] reexplained it and redirected it. I\n[19:40] thought, you know what, I don't want to\n[19:41] kill the the session. I want to keep\n[19:43] this one. and I still had like 45%\n[19:45] context uh left. So I thought it's going\n[19:48] to be fine. But maybe that's why it\n[19:50] started to hallucinates these things.\n[19:52] But it's exactly the same as me, right?\n[19:53] I can't remember. Oh, is it BD comments\n[19:55] ad or is it BD? Like I can't remember,\n[19:58] right? I also have to go real quick go\n[20:00] and look at BD help,\n[20:01] >> you know? I mean, right now we're at\n[20:03] like a golden age where like the AI is\n[20:05] probably as smart as a really smart\n[20:08] human\n[20:10] and I don't know few months from now\n[20:13] it's it we're getting to the point where\n[20:17] you know this mythical AGI depending how\n[20:20] you define it but like [snorts]\n[20:22] >> I I I guess my feeling right now is that\n[20:24] AI is going to be smarter than the\n[20:27] smartest human\n[20:29] uh pretty much Now, especially when it\n[20:32] gets more context, right,\n[20:34] >> it and it impacts the way that we work\n[20:37] together so much, right? I I had an off\n[20:40] off recording conversation with you\n[20:42] about how does the you asked me several\n[20:46] times like how do you see this scale\n[20:47] across a team? How do you see how do you\n[20:50] keep other team members that maybe do\n[20:51] not run cloud code yet and and engage\n[20:55] them into these like processes so that\n[20:57] they\n[20:57] >> Well, it's never too late. It's never\n[20:59] too late. It's never too late. But but\n[21:01] um\n[21:02] I I I saw a comment on on LinkedIn just\n[21:07] a few hours ago which was um about using\n[21:11] AI's agent to work on your issues and\n[21:14] somebody said ah I remember it was\n[21:16] purely about the documentation part\n[21:18] saying like oh you know do you a lot of\n[21:20] people think that the code is the\n[21:21] documentation and and and basically you\n[21:23] should read the code and documentation\n[21:24] is always outdated but this is like um\n[21:28] you know really stupid. Imagine that you\n[21:30] have to work on React and there's no\n[21:31] proper docs, right? And then somebody\n[21:33] who works at Facebook Meta told said\n[21:35] that and you know I found that a lot of\n[21:37] times the documentation was outdated and\n[21:39] that the code actually is more accurate\n[21:41] than the documentation kind of this back\n[21:43] and forth. And I feel that the whole\n[21:45] idea of specri development is that you\n[21:47] completely inverse this, right? you you\n[21:49] inverse the the now you lead with\n[21:51] specification documents and you iterate\n[21:53] on the on the UX user experience through\n[21:56] those documents with like mockups and\n[21:58] all and whatever you can\n[22:00] >> get into a text format yeah that that\n[22:03] can fit into LLM workflows so the humans\n[22:06] you know with stakeholders in real life\n[22:08] you know work through these things and\n[22:10] maybe not just AI like not just other\n[22:13] human stakeholders but definitely it's\n[22:15] like you send an email you you said hey\n[22:17] JPD expand this and then the email goes\n[22:19] out and then somebody hey ex compress\n[22:22] this right so so you're inter\n[22:24] interacting between humans humans and\n[22:26] AIS are in in between everywhere um but\n[22:30] you start with the specifications and\n[22:32] basically the documentation is your\n[22:34] living proof and all of your integration\n[22:37] tests\n[22:38] >> are the validation of the documentation\n[22:40] and if the integration test fails it you\n[22:42] know they're onetoone with the with the\n[22:44] documentation and and he said well\n[22:46] that's like a fantasy because validation\n[22:48] is so hard at the moment, right? Um,\n[22:52] >> but I think we'll get\n[22:53] >> Wait a minute. I thought we I I thought\n[22:54] we started I thought you were talking\n[22:56] about specs in the sense that how do we\n[22:58] get the teams to sort of adopt that sort\n[23:01] of workflow\n[23:03] because like I I'm just speaking\n[23:04] anecdotally from working with the sort\n[23:07] of enterprisey clients that I work with\n[23:11] the thing that that that makes my my\n[23:14] mind panic or I I don't know how to deal\n[23:16] with is that is that like these\n[23:17] enterprises are so slow and AI is so\n[23:21] fast\n[23:22] that the cadence is completely\n[23:24] mismatched. So I like like how do you\n[23:28] how do you have these meeting how do you\n[23:30] coordinate um all the stakeholders in a\n[23:33] typical enterprise to basically iterate\n[23:36] at the speed of AI and spectrum\n[23:39] development. I I just don't even see it\n[23:41] happening.\n[23:42] [laughter]\n[23:43] But [clears throat] maybe I'm just being\n[23:44] pessimistic at this point. I'm also\n[23:47] trying to find because I read somewhere\n[23:50] someone saying basically you know I am\n[23:54] entrenched in what what the same thing\n[23:56] you said I'm entrenched in these\n[23:58] enterprise systems confluence and um you\n[24:02] know Jira and basically you I I don't\n[24:06] live isolated like my cloud needs to be\n[24:08] aware of it I need the bridge across my\n[24:11] >> exactly so one thing I worked on on\n[24:14] working hours yesterday and I don't\n[24:15] think uh people were impressed or they\n[24:19] they didn't understand what I was trying\n[24:20] to do perhaps even though I tried to\n[24:22] explain it to them. I I was just trying\n[24:25] out this uh workflow. So I don't know if\n[24:27] you know about this u there's a couple\n[24:30] of workflows. This Telefonica one seemed\n[24:32] to be the most featureful one and I\n[24:34] started at the Huh?\n[24:36] >> Telefonica.\n[24:38] >> Yeah.\n[24:38] >> I don't know this\n[24:39] >> Telefonica. the the biggest uh mobile\n[24:43] operator in Spain, I think.\n[24:45] >> Telefonica workflow.\n[24:47] >> Well, anyway, they Telefonica is the big\n[24:50] enterprise that that created the action\n[24:53] and and what happens is that you you\n[24:55] have your I don't know if you're looking\n[24:56] at my uh\n[24:57] >> and now I can see it. MD Confluence.\n[24:59] >> Yeah, you have all your your your\n[25:01] markdown\n[25:02] >> and what it does is that it ships it up\n[25:04] into into a particular place in your\n[25:07] Confluence, right? And then it adds this\n[25:09] automation notice. This page is synced\n[25:11] automatically. Changes made.\n[25:13] >> Yo, I was trying to do this like five\n[25:14] years ago. I'm so sick of confluence.\n[25:17] Even the markdown editing confidence\n[25:19] doesn't work.\n[25:20] >> So I was basically telling my colleagues\n[25:21] that like hey I'm doing this so that we\n[25:23] can start using markdown more which I\n[25:26] think I mean it's going to be such an\n[25:28] uphill battle cuz like I I mean I'm not\n[25:32] I'm exaggerating but I'm not\n[25:34] exaggerating in the sense that I think\n[25:35] some of my colleagues don't even know\n[25:36] what markdown is. You know what I mean?\n[25:38] It's like this is going to be a\n[25:40] struggle. [laughter]\n[25:42] >> That's That's pretty dire.\n[25:43] >> Well, actually, my answer is\n[25:45] >> how do they feel about YAML then? Still\n[25:47] XML?\n[25:48] >> Well, it's going to take Yeah, like\n[25:53] um\n[25:53] >> Well, they're ready for us to go full\n[25:55] circle. [laughter]\n[25:57] >> They're they're in the opportune\n[25:58] location for us to go full circle back\n[26:01] to XML.\n[26:01] >> Yeah, but like\n[26:04] >> I mean I'm I'm probably exaggerating\n[26:05] things. I think I think my colleagues\n[26:07] will can start adopting these AI\n[26:10] workflows and we'll see very great\n[26:14] results. It's just that um\n[26:17] >> I found it\n[26:18] >> I'm just I'm just trying to formulate a\n[26:22] plan to sort of get them using markdown,\n[26:26] get them get get them in just writing\n[26:29] down things would be amazing,\n[26:33] >> right? So but this is like an extension\n[26:36] of the the the the code is the latest\n[26:39] version. It's like I feel there's\n[26:40] different tiers because you can start in\n[26:42] Confluence then you can start you can\n[26:45] start you know create a project or\n[26:46] repository out of it and start writing\n[26:48] documents in that repository and have\n[26:51] the code next to those documents and\n[26:53] then as you change things um you can you\n[26:56] can assume that it trickles back up you\n[26:58] know from the code back to the in repo\n[27:00] docs back to the conference.\n[27:01] >> Yeah. Like somehow like I had this\n[27:04] discussion at infinitum at my previous\n[27:06] company where I was like I hated we had\n[27:09] like three four different document\n[27:11] management systems. We had Google Docs.\n[27:14] Well I probably introduced that one.\n[27:16] [laughter] We had Quip. I don't know if\n[27:18] you know that one. We had notion and\n[27:20] then we had inreo markdown.\n[27:22] >> And basically you work with external\n[27:25] people that don't have notion using\n[27:26] Google Docs. And then you have uh quip\n[27:30] where you put like short like the um you\n[27:33] know it's like a shared document space\n[27:35] and then you you um you had the original\n[27:38] founders of the company started with\n[27:40] notion and basically all of the HR\n[27:42] tracking documents and everything was in\n[27:44] notion and and so\n[27:46] >> that's a good way about it\n[27:48] >> because but yeah so in the past it was I\n[27:51] don't know Microsoft word or something\n[27:56] and then it would probably trickle into\n[27:59] um into into Confluence for want of a\n[28:03] better word.\n[28:06] And this is the temp the typical content\n[28:09] management of a of a enterprise. And\n[28:12] then if you're lucky if you're lucky it\n[28:14] would it would be yeah GitHub repose or\n[28:18] something like this. This is this is\n[28:20] like the the the the machine of the\n[28:23] enterprise. And what needs to happen\n[28:27] really to just to accommodate AI is that\n[28:31] well I mean this is my my current\n[28:34] thinking is that the GitHub repo is is\n[28:39] the source of truth\n[28:42] and then we then we go from there to\n[28:46] >> to to Confluence so that other people\n[28:49] can read the docs.\n[28:51] >> But then how does it get to Microsoft\n[28:53] Word? Um,\n[28:55] yeah. This is where things get a little\n[28:56] bit weird, don't they?\n[28:58] >> You still I mean, I thought you were\n[28:59] talking about the 70s when you No,\n[29:01] sorry. About the the the the '9s when\n[29:03] you mentioned Microsoft Word. What are\n[29:05] you talking about? Who is using\n[29:07] Microsoft Word? I thought everyone\n[29:08] already\n[29:09] >> enterprises are enterprises are like\n[29:12] there's people who, you know, don't code\n[29:14] and\n[29:16] >> yeah, I mean like how do you get\n[29:18] >> I don't understand what you're saying.\n[29:20] [laughter]\n[29:22] But this is this is the problem I have.\n[29:24] How do how do we get uh\n[29:27] to this flow essentially?\n[29:30] >> Yeah. So so I make a joke about this,\n[29:32] but this was exactly the problem I had\n[29:34] with my previous company cuz I kept\n[29:36] saying Markdown is a source of truth and\n[29:39] he was saying we have other people that\n[29:41] don't code. I guess I just don't get\n[29:43] that. Um and that that don't you know\n[29:46] access um markdown. He says like there's\n[29:49] a a design step before you go to the\n[29:52] repo.\n[29:54] >> Something that is\n[29:56] >> across multiple repos that's\n[29:59] so the design step is is now with AI\n[30:02] essentially talking to the AI and and\n[30:04] and the artifact is markdown or some or\n[30:08] plain text and that's that's what we're\n[30:11] familiar with.\n[30:13] I think those people that are still\n[30:14] using Microsoft Word are also those\n[30:16] people that are still uh going into a\n[30:18] chat GPT session and then ask to and\n[30:20] then manually copy paste out the code\n[30:22] that it proposes. [laughter]\n[30:25] >> Yeah.\n[30:25] >> Or like or like do a bunch of deep\n[30:27] research. I mean I I'm jo I shouldn't be\n[30:30] too\n[30:31] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I did that\n[30:33] >> the people in this in this Microsoft\n[30:35] Word domain are are using JBT in their\n[30:38] web browser for sure.\n[30:39] >> Exactly. Right.\n[30:41] >> Um Yeah. like how how to in how to\n[30:44] include people here in the in the AI\n[30:50] iterative iterative process\n[30:53] >> iteratorative\n[30:56] iterative\n[30:58] yeah this this is this is my thought\n[31:00] here so I send you a link in the chat um\n[31:04] because for me I I think we I just I\n[31:07] think spec driven design and you just\n[31:09] turned this upside down right but I can\n[31:11] imagine to introduce that to enterprises\n[31:13] is very hard. Uh but this guy's um appar\n[31:16] this is this post looks like my workflow\n[31:19] blah blah blah but actually he's he's\n[31:20] one of the like it's a promotion for a\n[31:23] platform called core. So at the bottom\n[31:25] you see yes I work for core which is\n[31:27] like red planet HQ core. Um but core is\n[31:30] seem to be like a drop in to integrate\n[31:33] multiple platforms. He says I have to\n[31:36] work on tasks that are spread across\n[31:38] GitHub issues uh inside linear which is\n[31:41] I guess the modern Jira inside Slack\n[31:44] threads and I even get emails. So I want\n[31:47] to coordinate my tasks and collate my\n[31:51] work items, you know, determine my\n[31:53] priorities\n[31:54] >> between all these different I the\n[31:57] >> to me is like kill the other platforms,\n[31:59] >> you know, but realistic from\n[32:02] >> all these I mean this confluence inter\n[32:04] this this confluence integration in my\n[32:07] opinion holds very little value really\n[32:10] because because uh it becomes uh it\n[32:14] becomes read only doesn't\n[32:18] Yeah,\n[32:20] it I mean but to to be honest um a pull\n[32:24] request flow to make adjustments to a\n[32:26] document is not the same as like a\n[32:28] Google Docs shared session and co\n[32:30] collaboratively editing and proposing\n[32:33] changes. Like if you use Google Docs or\n[32:35] Quip, you can highlight a section, add a\n[32:38] comment, or you can go into proposal\n[32:40] mode and just delete a se a paragraph,\n[32:42] rephrase it, and then the author or the\n[32:44] document owner. Even if it's yourself,\n[32:46] but you want to keep track of the\n[32:48] changes that you're proposing can then\n[32:49] accept or can discuss, which try and do\n[32:52] that on the pull request. Try\n[32:54] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this\n[32:55] GitHub repos\n[32:58] Yeah. that conjures up nightmares of\n[33:00] pull requests, which is uh\n[33:01] >> so something like I think has a purpose.\n[33:04] Something like a collaborative doc\n[33:06] platform. Confluence is horrible. I\n[33:08] think I love how Microsoft works like\n[33:10] the Google Docs.\n[33:11] >> I like what you said. So, so you can\n[33:12] comment,\n[33:14] edit,\n[33:17] and then that and then that feeds into\n[33:20] um but how do how do we get from\n[33:23] Confluence into uh you know,\n[33:26] >> don't call it Confluence, call it\n[33:28] documentation platform. I'm just\n[33:29] allergic to Atllesian. Ah,\n[33:34] >> okay. Just never mind.\n[33:36] >> Okay. Doc platform. So, how how do we\n[33:38] get Yeah, I don't understand how we get\n[33:39] from there into there.\n[33:42] So, it would basically be listening to\n[33:45] any dock changes\n[33:47] and then and then claw code would do a a\n[33:50] plan like because\n[33:54] Yeah. Like how is this going to work\n[33:56] Vincent? How is this going to work?\n[33:59] I built something but I don't want to\n[34:02] talk about it. [laughter]\n[34:05] >> Okay. Well, I built something that is\n[34:08] doc platform that u allows you to\n[34:11] comment on line ranges and it creates\n[34:14] edit batches uh as and basically it is\n[34:17] up to a human to to\n[34:21] step through an edit batch which is\n[34:23] basic basically\n[34:25] >> but we iterate through the comments. you\n[34:27] select which comments you want to\n[34:29] address and which ones you want to skip.\n[34:30] >> Actually, let's wind it back a bit. I'm\n[34:33] gonna attack the idea of of stakeholders\n[34:36] actually commenting and editing because\n[34:38] in my experience\n[34:40] many stakeholders and big enterprises,\n[34:42] they're never going to edit or comment\n[34:45] on a on a doc platform. I'm you know\n[34:47] this is this is this is like middle\n[34:49] management zone if that\n[34:52] >> I don't know if this is placed\n[34:53] advertisement but I think this is would\n[34:55] be interesting to attend the um packed\n[34:58] publishing workshop on specd driven\n[35:01] development with ko where they talk\n[35:02] about writing specifications\n[35:05] and collaborating on and and basically\n[35:08] it's from an AWS principal engineer and\n[35:11] he talks about how AWS manages these\n[35:14] documents\n[35:15] >> you understand Uh\n[35:16] >> I think I think that's why I would go to\n[35:18] that workshop because it's not just\n[35:20] about specdriven development but also\n[35:22] the aspect of how does AWS approach this\n[35:26] document approach and how does it flow\n[35:28] into a specification that then is uh\n[35:30] worked on in KO.\n[35:31] >> Yeah,\n[35:32] >> that that is the step that is that is\n[35:33] basically this right how do I get from a\n[35:35] doc to to cloud code to whatever is my\n[35:40] um agent shell. Um,\n[35:42] >> yeah. Yeah, it be interesting though the\n[35:46] I mean I think Amazon is probably\n[35:48] there's definitely some people who are\n[35:50] doing cool things in Amazon, but it\n[35:52] doesn't seem to show, you know what I\n[35:53] mean? Like\n[35:55] >> Yeah. No, but like I also um\n[36:00] Amazon uses a dock platform before it\n[36:02] goes into KO, right? And\n[36:06] maybe these are, you know, pro processes\n[36:08] that have been so long in place that,\n[36:11] you know, you can't just overnight\n[36:13] replace because of AI is now in the mix.\n[36:15] >> And so most of the effort is like, how\n[36:17] do I get AI in the loop on all of these\n[36:19] other processes, you know, we're we're\n[36:21] always thinking about letting AI do the\n[36:23] work and keeping the human in the loop,\n[36:25] but in a lot of these scenarios, and I\n[36:26] read this from a LinkedIn post, um, you\n[36:29] need to look at it from how to get AI in\n[36:31] the loop, right? What's your question is\n[36:32] cloud go there is AI how do I get AI in\n[36:35] the loop\n[36:35] >> I like this loop I think is important\n[36:37] because even if we make integrations\n[36:40] here\n[36:43] the stakeholders really need to be here\n[36:44] to see what's AI is is spitting back at\n[36:48] them otherwise they're going to be out\n[36:49] of the loop right\n[36:53] >> uh\n[36:54] >> like how do how do we create a loop here\n[36:55] there need there needs to be a loop uh\n[36:57] as you as you said\n[37:00] you know what I'm saying like you we\n[37:02] might form this hero or whatever.\n[37:06] We might be able to connect the dots,\n[37:09] but if the if if the loop isn't uh you\n[37:13] know, if if this isn't going if this if\n[37:15] this loop isn't isn't like super fast,\n[37:19] then the whole thing breaks down. This\n[37:21] is why, you know, claw code in a\n[37:23] terminal is such a fantastic experience\n[37:26] is because you you're there in with the\n[37:29] code\n[37:31] and uh you're looping so so so quickly\n[37:34] with each person of the key.\n[37:38] But doesn't that go offline? Like\n[37:42] I I think it has a it has a benefit to\n[37:44] have cloud in at the meeting table\n[37:47] saying like oh by the way guys think\n[37:48] about these different ways that you\n[37:50] could address this. Um but doesn't it go\n[37:53] go from we have a discussion either on a\n[37:56] document either in a in a in a call or\n[37:58] in a meeting room and we based on that\n[38:01] discussion we have highlighted sections\n[38:03] that need to we rework and then somebody\n[38:06] takes that offline basically with cloud\n[38:09] code and and iterates through some of\n[38:11] these proposals and makes decisions and\n[38:14] then those reisions result in in changes\n[38:16] to the document and a new version of the\n[38:19] document is published. Um then overview\n[38:23] it.\n[38:23] >> Yes. And you say that's too slow because\n[38:25] you get a very fast feedback loop with\n[38:27] cloud code. But I feel it is not\n[38:29] productive to have everyone at the table\n[38:30] for those individual iterations.\n[38:32] >> Okay. So so basically let me just\n[38:36] now I'm really talking about what I've\n[38:38] built. [laughter]\n[38:40] >> So essentially\n[38:41] >> because I spent one week like se five\n[38:43] days on on on this on this idea.\n[38:49] So the so basically it goes back into\n[38:52] the document.\n[38:54] Um\n[38:57] >> I think you you you can just the the\n[39:00] area above arrow above can go back into\n[39:03] the document\n[39:03] >> anyway. No. Yeah.\n[39:06] >> And then it goes\n[39:08] Yeah. I still think this is going to be\n[39:10] too slow.\n[39:13] >> Yeah. [clears throat]\n[39:15] [snorts] or just\n[39:17] I mean there is a there's surely sign\n[39:20] some scientific uh\n[39:22] >> too slow compared to what to reality to\n[39:25] today.\n[39:26] >> Well like\n[39:28] >> because today it's way slower. There's a\n[39:30] there's a law of you know the more\n[39:32] people you add to a project the more\n[39:34] communication overhead you have and I\n[39:36] feel I feel like you know even though I\n[39:40] put one person here in reality there's a\n[39:43] whole team there could be like 10 people\n[39:45] here that we have to like\n[39:48] reach alignment with and the\n[39:49] stakeholders there could be another\n[39:51] another you know three or four\n[39:54] stakeholders or whatever\n[39:56] there could be\n[39:59] the this.\n[40:03] Yeah, just just reaching alignment is\n[40:06] going to be so challenging here.\n[40:08] >> There was a human caterpillar. Oh, what?\n[40:09] The human uh\n[40:13] for a while. [laughter]\n[40:15] Never mind.\n[40:17] >> This is going to be nuts. This is going\n[40:19] to be nuts.\n[40:21] >> Yeah. So, um I'm actually been like\n[40:25] opening threads like crazy to see how\n[40:28] people and I think one of the\n[40:30] interesting organizations working on\n[40:32] this is human layers. They did a a\n[40:34] presentation where they heavily\n[40:35] referenced Steve Jagis beats project as\n[40:38] well and talking about um you know at\n[40:43] what at what stage you have um brain rot\n[40:47] how do they call it? So, so because of\n[40:50] the I think they they say at the 30% 40%\n[40:54] mark, if you only have 40% left of uh\n[40:57] unused context, that's where you are in\n[41:01] the non-productive zone of your context\n[41:03] window. And so he he highlights it's\n[41:05] called um the the talk is called harness\n[41:08] engineering and we can link it um later\n[41:11] but he talks about how to control that\n[41:15] context and common mistakes and um this\n[41:20] relates to this I'm I'm sure because it\n[41:22] talks about how you get the context um\n[41:26] and how you you know how you optimize\n[41:28] your workflow. Basically, human layers\n[41:30] does a lot of effort there. At the end\n[41:31] of of of his talk, he talks about if you\n[41:33] like what what I've talked about, go\n[41:35] check out human layers. Um, in terms of\n[41:37] like how do we, you know, interact and\n[41:40] integrate this um this LM\n[41:42] >> human layers is some software then like\n[41:44] so I just I'm startup.\n[41:48] >> Well, I really like that thing that we\n[41:52] were talking about over over WhatsApp. I\n[41:54] mean everyone's going crazy about that\n[41:56] that that sort of uh I keep on it's got\n[41:59] such an in memorable name that that tool\n[42:03] that which basically prompts you what is\n[42:05] the name of it again?\n[42:07] >> Ask user tool.\n[42:09] >> Yeah, ask ask user tool. How about this?\n[42:12] I'm just riffing here.\n[42:17] But say you're working with AI,\n[42:22] the ask user tool\n[42:24] sends a message to to each of the sort\n[42:28] of stakeholders, the middle managers or\n[42:30] something like that and and ask them to\n[42:33] agree on this certain thing and then all\n[42:36] they need to press is like enter and\n[42:38] then they move on to the next thing and\n[42:40] then enter move on to next thing and if\n[42:42] if they don't so basically it's like\n[42:43] some sort of democracy because you know\n[42:47] stakeholder A and B might answer\n[42:49] something option one but stakeholder uh\n[42:54] uh C might option might say option two\n[42:58] or something. So we need some sort of\n[43:00] like democracy type or you know or get\n[43:04] get into some uh ubi no ubiquitous what\n[43:07] do you call it when unanimous decision\n[43:10] about a certainity thing.\n[43:12] >> Not unanimous I think it's majority.\n[43:15] >> Well yeah that's democracy but in\n[43:16] reality you want unanimous but you want\n[43:18] everyone to agree.\n[43:19] >> You're right. You're right. You're\n[43:20] right. I did.\n[43:21] >> Um,\n[43:22] >> but this is this is the thing that's\n[43:24] missing cuz like we we jump in and and\n[43:26] and and chat with Claude and it's like\n[43:29] some sort of like mindmeld.\n[43:31] >> Okay. So, what exists\n[43:32] >> social paradise but in reality there's\n[43:34] loads of stakeholders.\n[43:35] >> Okay. So, what exists today is you have\n[43:37] tools like warp terminal that do not\n[43:40] have a single Okay. what you're talking\n[43:43] about seems to be like um there's this\n[43:46] tool that you can uh share your shell\n[43:49] and then you can have other people on\n[43:51] the same shell. You know this one?\n[43:53] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can do that\n[43:55] with T-Max.\n[43:56] >> Yeah. You can do I think it's it's\n[43:58] basically a wraparound T-max that that\n[44:00] allows people to connect and have\n[44:01] multiple cursors and even\n[44:02] collaboratively edit in a shell. Um\n[44:07] so\n[44:09] and there's a lot of really cool stuff\n[44:11] using T-Max around agent that uh around\n[44:13] agents also but anyway today warp\n[44:17] terminal has the concept of an\n[44:19] individual session that you have with\n[44:22] cloud code that you can then after you\n[44:24] submit the code share that session right\n[44:27] um so you you get the link of that\n[44:29] session um so you have the full context\n[44:31] of how that code ended up to be what it\n[44:33] was But and another thing is open code\n[44:38] also has this feature. So open code they\n[44:41] have a server site that you can um I\n[44:45] think it's private. You can as an\n[44:47] enterprise subscribe but open code by\n[44:50] default. Open code is basically a cloud\n[44:51] open source cloud code version.\n[44:53] >> Yeah. I I tried it the other day. I was\n[44:56] >> I love it.\n[44:57] >> I've been playing on it a lot now.\n[45:00] >> But does does it have an ask user tool?\n[45:03] So I I linked to you the the proposal.\n[45:06] There's like two or three people do the\n[45:07] PR to add it in, but they're adding in\n[45:09] it into the core. So the reason why I\n[45:10] bring up open code and warp terminal and\n[45:12] sharing sessions is because what you're\n[45:14] proposing is like an ask group tool\n[45:17] which is like sending you know maybe\n[45:19] with with some type of team uh shell\n[45:21] sharing like um you know asking everyone\n[45:23] in the group to to respond.\n[45:25] >> I mean I'm not sure team sharing is\n[45:27] going to work because the way T-Max\n[45:29] works you share the same window, right?\n[45:32] >> Right. So, so everyone would need to\n[45:34] answer the same questions. But what I\n[45:35] want to say is open code has like three\n[45:38] or four PRs open to ask to add the ask\n[45:40] user tool into open code because it's\n[45:42] like one of the highly requested\n[45:44] features. But instead of adding it to\n[45:46] the core because apparently open code um\n[45:48] also has like a web app um environment\n[45:51] like the the terminal user interface is\n[45:53] just one of the interfaces that you can\n[45:54] use with open code. So they don't want\n[45:57] the ask user tool to be tightly coupled\n[45:59] to the core and tied to this terminal\n[46:00] user interface interaction because then\n[46:02] it doesn't really work well across all\n[46:04] the other interfaces that they expose\n[46:06] which to me things there could be a\n[46:07] collaborative document type of interface\n[46:09] on top of of of open code as well right\n[46:12] but to solve the problem they're adding\n[46:15] a new kind of user interaction model\n[46:17] into the core of open code that means\n[46:20] anyone can then implement ask user tool\n[46:22] as a plug-in so the core supports\n[46:25] your plugin to define like rich model\n[46:29] interactions like open a tapped\n[46:31] interface provide options and and with\n[46:33] with up and down. So I think that's\n[46:36] amazing. Um and that's only because it's\n[46:39] open source.\n[46:39] >> Yeah.\n[46:40] >> Yeah. So we can build something like\n[46:42] this, right? But like but like let's go\n[46:44] into the nitty nitty diddy details. Do\n[46:46] you think it should be unanimous? Do you\n[46:48] think this like say there's three\n[46:50] stakeholders in a project? Do you think\n[46:54] do you think they they can come to\n[46:56] unanimous decision or they should\n[46:58] >> Sounds like\n[47:00] [snorts]\n[47:00] >> everyone raise their hand at the same\n[47:02] time and if you don't agree then the\n[47:04] person that don't agree with the\n[47:05] majority has to explain why and then you\n[47:07] have to all raise your hands again\n[47:10] on the\n[47:10] >> Yeah, that sounds like a really good\n[47:12] agile exercise, isn't it?\n[47:15] >> I have no idea what agile is.\n[47:18] >> Planning poker. I I've never heard of\n[47:20] it.\n[47:20] >> Yes. You never you don't know planning\n[47:22] poker.\n[47:23] >> Where does it come?\n[47:25] >> You need to use Fibonacci numbers.\n[47:27] That's all I remember. Or t-shirt size\n[47:29] from poker.\n[47:31] >> Yeah. So the idea is that that you\n[47:33] discuss about uh a feature and then you\n[47:36] have to estimate the size story points\n[47:38] basically.\n[47:39] >> Oh yeah. But that's not I mean\n[47:41] estimating that that's the trouble with\n[47:44] um with AI like does it make sense to to\n[47:48] estimate a story anymore? No, we're not\n[47:50] talking about that. We're talking about\n[47:51] the the process of planning poker,\n[47:54] right? So, the process of planning poker\n[47:56] is you're in a group, there's a feature\n[47:59] and people need to agree, need to align.\n[48:02] And your problem is\n[48:03] >> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, it's an alignment\n[48:06] tool.\n[48:07] >> Yeah. Planning ping poker in the process\n[48:10] of planning poker there's an alignment\n[48:11] proc there's an aligning concept because\n[48:15] everybody the way is like you raise up\n[48:17] your hands. uh you're not supposed to\n[48:19] like look at each other. You have to\n[48:20] make a decision and and and you know\n[48:23] >> Yeah. Some people use t-shirt sizes,\n[48:25] some people use numbers, but if you use\n[48:27] numbers, it's like Fibonacci Fibonacci\n[48:30] sequence to make sure that it's not too\n[48:32] like if you have a a gradual number\n[48:34] range, people always go for the middle.\n[48:36] But if you have Fibonacci numbers, it's\n[48:37] more like um I read a lot about this a\n[48:40] long time ago. I don't remember.\n[48:41] >> Yeah, I' I've played this game. I've\n[48:42] played this game.\n[48:43] >> Yeah. But but I mean if coming back to\n[48:46] your original question about finding a\n[48:48] unonymous or or\n[48:50] >> Yeah, I think it's a good I think I\n[48:51] think it's a good suggestion. I really I\n[48:53] really do actually. Um\n[48:54] >> yeah,\n[48:57] >> there's lots of there's lots of tool I\n[48:58] think there's there's like Jirro plugins\n[49:01] to to to do what you just described. So\n[49:04] we we need we need an ask user tool\n[49:07] planning planning poker\n[49:08] >> ask group tool\n[49:10] >> and we and we need plugin\n[49:11] >> and I need it planning poker I need it\n[49:15] implemented by um Monday. So see you see\n[49:20] you then then Vincent.\n[49:22] >> So first off the open code PRs you could\n[49:25] you could look at open code and take\n[49:27] these PRs and and but then it goes into\n[49:30] core. So the reality is that open code\n[49:33] says this is a highly requested feature\n[49:34] and we're going to build these nice UI\n[49:37] um you know functionality directly into\n[49:39] the core so that plugins can build\n[49:41] really interactive um you know models\n[49:45] then imagine that that plugins but still\n[49:48] I think the plug-in system with open\n[49:50] code will be on a single user interface\n[49:52] it won't be something that goes over\n[49:54] across a server with websockets that\n[49:56] then updates everyone's screen like hey\n[49:58] here are here's the next question here\n[49:59] are five options\n[50:00] Which one do you pick?\n[50:01] >> You build it like beads and then you can\n[50:03] have your your your crazy UI on top of\n[50:06] it, right?\n[50:07] >> Yeah. So, for me, I the way I I I solved\n[50:10] it in in the thing that I've been\n[50:11] building, it's um it's more of an\n[50:13] offline flow. It's like one of the\n[50:15] persons goes and evaluates all the\n[50:17] options and then the system keeps track\n[50:19] of what they received.\n[50:20] >> Actually, that brings me sorry to to\n[50:25] slight tangent. beads. Surely beads\n[50:29] could maybe incorporate some sort of\n[50:35] option to to refine the uh the story or\n[50:39] something like that or\n[50:40] >> but it to be honest beads is more of the\n[50:42] the the actual task markup than getting\n[50:45] to the Yeah, you're right. Okay. And I\n[50:47] think it's good to um isolate this\n[50:50] because that's where I love beats\n[50:52] because it fits perfectly in my process\n[50:54] or any process that I choose to use for\n[50:56] me right now individually going through\n[50:58] the you know research plan implement\n[51:00] phases which I do with specit but\n[51:03] there's openspec there's spec cli\n[51:05] there's like a 100 different\n[51:06] implementations of specdriven\n[51:08] development under the sun so beats is\n[51:10] perfect because it doesn't concern\n[51:11] itself with however you get to those\n[51:13] tasks right Okay, so let's just\n[51:17] hypothetically imagine that\n[51:21] this is working. Stakeholders are\n[51:24] agreeing,\n[51:26] beads are created, beads are executed on\n[51:30] and then something is built, right?\n[51:34] Um then what happens then? Is there some\n[51:37] sort of accepting testing? Is there\n[51:41] like how do we get the stakeholder cuz\n[51:43] like this is another sort of\n[51:45] communication issue whereby like you\n[51:48] know you and I we would we would plan\n[51:51] something then we would create the beads\n[51:53] and then we would you know BD ready get\n[51:56] the agent to to implement it but and\n[51:59] then we would have to like uh review the\n[52:02] code and check everything is looking\n[52:04] great\n[52:06] >> and then and then and then and then and\n[52:08] then test the product and then and then\n[52:11] deliver the product and then\n[52:13] >> I think there you're you're you're first\n[52:15] of forgetting some of the agile\n[52:16] principles, right? Which is build a\n[52:19] minimal first to get user feedback\n[52:22] quickly. We all know that whatever the\n[52:24] user agrees to is not really what they\n[52:25] want until they see it.\n[52:27] >> Oh, okay. So then we're going we're\n[52:29] going back to an MVP.\n[52:32] >> Yes. And and this is one of the\n[52:34] takeaways that like people say when they\n[52:36] work with AI is that you don't create\n[52:39] mock-ups or you don't come with a design\n[52:41] specification with AI. You come with an\n[52:43] MVP. You actually implement it and you\n[52:46] let people play with it.\n[52:47] >> Um because it goes so fast. So So we\n[52:50] need when we do these planning poker,\n[52:53] we're talking about like small sprint\n[52:55] type of things and we need the\n[52:57] acceptance criteria aside from all\n[52:59] agreeing that this is what we want to\n[53:01] build. We need to get an MVP. We and\n[53:02] this is the great thing about specit by\n[53:04] the way when when I do a feature\n[53:06] definition it's always going to identify\n[53:08] the MVP of like what is the smallest\n[53:10] type of features that I need to to to\n[53:12] that I can show to someone for the\n[53:14] initial like UX feel of it um and I\n[53:17] think that's great uh in in these tools\n[53:20] um like\n[53:22] let's let's role play here so let's just\n[53:25] say like oh here's this MVP uh check it\n[53:29] out on localhost\n[53:32] uh 8,000.\n[53:34] Um so they they check it out and then\n[53:38] then what happens then there's new\n[53:40] requirements like ah actually this\n[53:42] should say um you should say food\n[53:45] instead of bar and then and then it it\n[53:49] at this point it engages Claude again\n[53:51] because like especially I'm just\n[53:53] thinking aloud for like UI based uh web\n[53:56] based things like Claude probably\n[53:59] doesn't even know what the render looks\n[54:02] like or something like that or you know\n[54:04] like I'm just I'm just thinking there's\n[54:06] going to be there's going to be new\n[54:08] challenges here to engage with the argu\n[54:11] I you mean this this is this is the this\n[54:13] is a planning tool but like but we need\n[54:16] another tool to facilitate the\n[54:18] iterations once the MVP is built or\n[54:21] wouldn't you or maybe I'm just\n[54:24] complicating\n[54:25] >> no I think that's where we need to just\n[54:27] fall back to existing processes because\n[54:30] your session your cloud session of this\n[54:32] planning session is gone, right? That's\n[54:34] that's an ephemeral shortlived session.\n[54:36] You have some output artifacts that you\n[54:39] you either, you know, that you fed into\n[54:42] because I think there's still a very\n[54:43] >> So [clears throat] you I think I know\n[54:45] what you're saying. You're going to you\n[54:46] just start again. You you you throw away\n[54:47] the MVP\n[54:49] and then you you start you start from\n[54:52] scratch or something. Is that what\n[54:53] you're saying?\n[54:53] >> It depends. Um it depends how what what\n[54:57] what you want to do with the MVP. If you\n[54:59] if you're an enterprise and you can\n[55:01] spend $1,000 on on on on cloud tokens, I\n[55:04] think you can throw away and or generate\n[55:06] five different MVPs. Me personally, if\n[55:09] if I spend a weekly budget of 20 dollars\n[55:12] a month on my on my MVP, I don't really\n[55:15] want to throw it away.\n[55:17] Okay, so let's imagine now that we\n[55:21] started from scratch, we used a whole\n[55:22] bunch of tokens and now we have\n[55:24] something that that the three\n[55:25] stakeholders\n[55:27] are happy with.\n[55:30] um isn't there going to be a question of\n[55:32] maintainability like\n[55:35] or uh\n[55:36] >> so this is where I feel the the idea of\n[55:39] maintainability of software is going to\n[55:40] change significantly because and I think\n[55:44] be uh Steve also says this very nicely\n[55:45] when he talks about beats he says I\n[55:48] created in October so what three months\n[55:50] and it has thousands of users right now\n[55:53] I have never looked at the code I've not\n[55:56] looked at the code and if you look at\n[55:58] but I think he's exaggerating\n[56:00] And if you look at Gast Town, he says he\n[56:04] gives like a bunch of caveats. It's\n[56:05] going to cost you a lot of money. It's\n[56:06] going to cost you an arm and a leg. It's\n[56:07] going to be insane if you're not at\n[56:09] stage seven of AI adoption. He he makes\n[56:12] a diagram of like um you know people\n[56:14] that um that use AI.\n[56:17] >> Is that in his in his blog? I didn't\n[56:19] >> Yeah. Yeah. Very nice diagram of like\n[56:21] the level of AI adoption. And then he he\n[56:23] asks are you at the stage where you\n[56:25] learn run at least five different\n[56:27] headless cloud sessions? If you're not,\n[56:29] then this is not for you. Yeah, [snorts]\n[56:32] that one. So, figure one is\n[56:36] um\n[56:37] zero or near zero. So, you don't use\n[56:41] figure two is AI is doing proposals. You\n[56:44] say yes, no, and you adopt Exactly.\n[56:47] >> Okay, we've been talking about this,\n[56:49] >> right? Figure three is you go yolo mode\n[56:51] with the agent completely managing your\n[56:53] code and you are still looking at the\n[56:56] code. Figure four I forgot what's the\n[56:58] figure the difference between three and\n[57:00] four but clearly the code is less\n[57:01] important. Figure five is you're fully\n[57:03] in the terminal with one cloud session.\n[57:05] Figure six is you are in the ter like\n[57:07] multiple cloud sessions and figure seven\n[57:10] is like guest town is if you're at\n[57:12] figure seven or eight you have like a a\n[57:14] significant amount of parallel cloud\n[57:17] sessions running. He explains them in in\n[57:19] uh in the blog uh below. I\n[57:22] >> I uh I haven't got through the blog, but\n[57:24] yeah. So, this makes me think we've been\n[57:27] talking about this at length and but\n[57:28] like at at this point we're only on\n[57:31] stage two and it feels like we're a\n[57:33] little bit behind\n[57:33] >> each and everyone individual right I'm\n[57:36] I'm pretty much as figure five. I'm\n[57:38] having I'm usually running a single\n[57:40] cloud session and I don't look at the\n[57:42] code. This is why and you say it's going\n[57:44] to create a problem with code\n[57:45] maintainability. I believe that docs\n[57:48] first\n[57:50] um integration test or end to end\n[57:52] playright is your validation of the\n[57:55] docs. So these are always a sync. If\n[57:58] they're not then you have a problem and\n[58:00] then your code. You may want to run some\n[58:02] security of defec ops agents to identify\n[58:05] vulnerabilities and things like that and\n[58:06] some well architecture reviews of your\n[58:09] code but personally you will not like\n[58:12] you know you only look at it at a high\n[58:13] level architecture and you put your\n[58:15] observability around it. You look at\n[58:17] your memory usage and you basically\n[58:19] identify bottlenecks and you only\n[58:21] refactor when needed like no pre\n[58:22] premature optimization. Anytime you look\n[58:25] at the code it's premature optimization\n[58:27] like you should just you know trust the\n[58:29] process.\n[58:31] I think so. And and you you trust that\n[58:33] your docs and integration tests catch\n[58:36] any regressions. So you can say, \"Hey, I\n[58:38] want to change this whole feature and\n[58:40] then uh or I add a new feature.\" And\n[58:42] then you can just run the thing and it\n[58:43] goes like, \"Yep, all of the existing\n[58:45] user stories still work. You're good to\n[58:47] go.\" And we have a new one and it's\n[58:49] fully covered by integration tests.\n[58:52] >> Wow, man. This the future that we're\n[58:54] heading in is really crazy. But like\n[58:58] take beads for example. Say\n[59:01] Say Steve decided like I'm not looking\n[59:03] at the code and I wanted to reimplement\n[59:06] again. Um I'm assuming beat has some\n[59:09] sort of test harness or something like\n[59:11] that. And that's where that's where it's\n[59:14] super important like what the whole\n[59:15] thing I said, right? You need to have at\n[59:18] least\n[59:20] a um you know a quick feedback loop for\n[59:22] your AI when it makes a change to know\n[59:24] that like oops I broke you know all of\n[59:26] this other stuff that's suddenly block\n[59:27] the integration tests are not working.\n[59:29] But I'm happy to say that I don't see\n[59:31] cloud going and saying oop this test\n[59:33] isn't doesn't\n[59:34] >> I'm happy to say that cloud doesn't go\n[59:35] like oh this is a pre-existing issue let\n[59:37] me disable the test which it used to do\n[59:39] like a month ago.\n[59:40] >> Well this doesn't in my experience it\n[59:42] will just change the test.\n[59:44] >> No no it doesn't. So that's where I I do\n[59:47] look at the diff on my test\n[59:48] >> because that's a trouble with tests like\n[59:51] the tests can encode a lot of\n[59:53] assumptions and things like that.\n[59:55] >> Yeah. So I just I just did the whole\n[59:57] thing um which is like a dock platform\n[59:59] with LLM prompt for cloud ask user tool.\n[1:00:02] So that's the thing I built is is\n[1:00:03] basically tracking content going into an\n[1:00:06] cloud session with user tool to make\n[1:00:08] changes to and then check it back in. So\n[1:00:09] you have the the that's what I built and\n[1:00:13] I just realized that it assumes the\n[1:00:16] server processes access to the files on\n[1:00:18] local disk and I'm like hold on a minute\n[1:00:20] the do platform doesn't run on the CLI\n[1:00:22] you know the client side so it doesn't\n[1:00:24] have access to the disk so so the whole\n[1:00:26] design I totally missed um the fact that\n[1:00:28] the client needs to send the content to\n[1:00:30] the doc platform for to make changes and\n[1:00:32] so all of my integration tests are\n[1:00:34] passing because it is running within the\n[1:00:37] same workspace. So when the server gets\n[1:00:39] a request, it just reads the file from\n[1:00:41] the workspace instead of it running in a\n[1:00:43] separate one. So right now I'm doing a\n[1:00:45] massive refactor saying like okay create\n[1:00:46] a whole new set of integration tests\n[1:00:48] where the server process runs in a\n[1:00:49] different folder and to make sure\n[1:00:51] there's no case where um you know so\n[1:00:55] there's no way that that that the server\n[1:00:56] can you know modify a file locally\n[1:00:59] thinking that the client changes have\n[1:01:01] not been persisted. So, so yes, the you\n[1:01:03] need to look at those integration tests.\n[1:01:05] You need to you need to look at the\n[1:01:06] documentation and you need to look at\n[1:01:08] the integration test and I also ask\n[1:01:11] >> code the tests are part of the code,\n[1:01:13] right? I'm just I'm just thinking aloud\n[1:01:14] here. Yeah, there's there's no way of\n[1:01:16] getting around. Yeah. So that's another\n[1:01:18] comment I got is um some systems are so\n[1:01:21] complex multi microser and all that and\n[1:01:23] so this is very hard of a of a workflow\n[1:01:26] to implement over these complex systems\n[1:01:28] if you don't if you cannot spin up a\n[1:01:30] whole integration testing environment.\n[1:01:32] To me the integration testing is the\n[1:01:34] only place you or like even the\n[1:01:36] endto-end testing is the only place you\n[1:01:38] can actually do um validate that that\n[1:01:40] things work and then you\n[1:01:43] existing systems are not built for this\n[1:01:46] right existing systems heavily rely on\n[1:01:49] manual verification of QA um and and are\n[1:01:51] way too complex to to build a whole\n[1:01:53] integration testing environment but if\n[1:01:55] you're building something new\n[1:01:56] >> I just thinking allow just to put just\n[1:01:57] to put the tests in the code is kind of\n[1:01:59] dangerous um they kind of need to be\n[1:02:02] separated just for safety almost.\n[1:02:04] >> No, I don't think so. I prefer what I\n[1:02:07] like right now I I I've done four or\n[1:02:09] five projects where I use specit\n[1:02:11] development specit driven development\n[1:02:14] and beats and I go for a full monor repo\n[1:02:18] everything like side by side and it's\n[1:02:19] perfect because cloud can go yeah\n[1:02:22] >> and directly see hey my API is here my\n[1:02:25] protocol definitions are here my\n[1:02:26] integration testing are there and and I\n[1:02:28] need to go full stack like I need to go\n[1:02:30] and change my my my um my protoraph\n[1:02:34] >> okay so say we have some in end to- end\n[1:02:36] tests. I mean, normally in the modern\n[1:02:40] world, this would look like some,\n[1:02:44] you know, most most uh pieces of\n[1:02:47] software end up being a web page or or\n[1:02:50] an iOS app or something.\n[1:02:52] >> Mhm.\n[1:02:53] >> And and let's be honest, doing end\n[1:02:55] to-end tests on the web is still or or\n[1:02:58] or on mobile still a pain in the ass.\n[1:03:01] It's going to be quite manual, isn't it?\n[1:03:03] No, I I mean for the web app that I\n[1:03:06] built, I use Playright. I never used\n[1:03:08] Playright in my life, but cloud code\n[1:03:11] wrote the scripts and I I manually\n[1:03:14] verify it and I know it works. If it\n[1:03:16] doesn't, I say, \"Hey, the playright is\n[1:03:17] not covering this.\" And it goes and and\n[1:03:19] fixes it. It says now the play is\n[1:03:20] failing.\n[1:03:21] >> My like it works in trivial cases, but\n[1:03:24] in like big enterprise, if you ran\n[1:03:26] playright over in an Atlassian estate,\n[1:03:28] it would consume a billion tokens and\n[1:03:30] explode and\n[1:03:31] >> No, no, no. Not playright MCP. Okay.\n[1:03:34] Absolutely not Playright MCP. Playright\n[1:03:37] the actual test harness.\n[1:03:41] This is what I hate about the Playright\n[1:03:43] MCP is like this. They seem to assume\n[1:03:45] that you want the LLM to drive it and\n[1:03:47] spend a billion tokens to go through the\n[1:03:49] process.\n[1:03:49] >> Okay. You need to show me your usage of\n[1:03:51] playright. But I still I'm still\n[1:03:54] >> playright. If this is what we're going\n[1:03:56] to rely on to make sure that we're\n[1:03:57] delivering something that works, I'm a\n[1:04:01] bit nervous about this.\n[1:04:03] >> And that's that's reality today that so\n[1:04:05] many organizations don't have a proper\n[1:04:07] first off database seeding mechanism or\n[1:04:10] ability to even create a full\n[1:04:11] integration environment for integration\n[1:04:13] testing and then they don't have fully\n[1:04:15] automated end to like end toend testing\n[1:04:18] scripts. But if you write playright end\n[1:04:20] to end testing scripts, it actually\n[1:04:23] doesn't need an LLM to drive. Now go\n[1:04:25] click on this button. Let me take a\n[1:04:27] screenshot. Oh no, no, no, wait for this\n[1:04:29] button to appear. And then the LLM is\n[1:04:31] doing that. That's insane. That's\n[1:04:33] stupid. Playright has a scripting\n[1:04:35] engine. You can say in this particular\n[1:04:37] test case, we're going to, you know,\n[1:04:39] we're going to click on the login\n[1:04:40] button. It's going to redirect us to\n[1:04:42] Keycloak for enterprise login. So we\n[1:04:44] wait for the key logo to to appear, the\n[1:04:46] login to appear. uh we then log in with\n[1:04:49] our click click credentials for our\n[1:04:51] integration testing environment which is\n[1:04:52] bootstrapped by the way during the setup\n[1:04:54] phase. So I have a unique set of\n[1:04:56] credentials to use during my end to end\n[1:04:58] integration testing.\n[1:04:59] >> Doing credentials flow is going to be a\n[1:05:00] total pain.\n[1:05:02] >> Yeah. But that's why you need to build\n[1:05:05] these systems with automation in mind.\n[1:05:07] So so that that's real. It's true. I I\n[1:05:10] join many companies and they're like oh\n[1:05:12] we don't know how to do our things and\n[1:05:13] we want to have an integration testing\n[1:05:15] environment. And I'm like great. Yeah, I\n[1:05:17] can I can do that. And then like okay,\n[1:05:19] how do you bootstrap user accounts? How\n[1:05:20] do you set up this and that? And nothing\n[1:05:22] can be automated. Well, maybe I'm\n[1:05:23] talkingual failed career, but like I\n[1:05:26] have implemented a few integration tests\n[1:05:28] in my life, but they just tend to be so\n[1:05:31] expensive and hard to maintain and you\n[1:05:34] you make one or two\n[1:05:36] >> and then you know how it works, but then\n[1:05:38] you know you move on to another team or\n[1:05:40] you\n[1:05:41] >> But the great thing about LLMs is that\n[1:05:43] they like I never wrote a playright\n[1:05:44] script in my life, but the agent knows\n[1:05:47] and then it just works and then it\n[1:05:50] actually runs and when you go into the\n[1:05:52] playright studio, whatever the thing is\n[1:05:54] called that shows up the UI when you\n[1:05:55] when you run it in UI mode. It actually\n[1:05:57] you can see every single step like you\n[1:06:00] see the screen.\n[1:06:00] >> Okay, you need to show this to me. But\n[1:06:02] anyway, I think I think we're\n[1:06:04] >> but the thing is that you get a full LLM\n[1:06:06] context. Now this playright UI has a\n[1:06:09] rightclick button, copy error, copy\n[1:06:11] prompt, and you can prompt it. It says\n[1:06:13] we're in the playright test suite. This\n[1:06:15] is the step we're at. This is the error\n[1:06:17] that the browser console is showing.\n[1:06:19] This is what we saw in the previous step\n[1:06:22] and you don't need an LLM to drive.\n[1:06:23] >> Okay. In the next video, you need to\n[1:06:25] show me playright working as you've just\n[1:06:27] described.\n[1:06:29] >> You don't believe me?\n[1:06:30] >> I don't believe you. But but I want to\n[1:06:34] believe to be honest. Okay, let's let's\n[1:06:36] wind up.\n[1:06:37] >> I know that your comment is going to be\n[1:06:38] it's a trivial system that you're doing\n[1:06:39] this on. I showed it to you before. I\n[1:06:41] think I showed you the grit uh you login\n[1:06:44] flow.\n[1:06:44] >> Okay, so next is a focus on this. Let me\n[1:06:48] see if I can highlight it. Okay, cool. I\n[1:06:51] need to get on with my day. I'm sure you\n[1:06:52] do, too.\n[1:06:54] >> You don't believe me. I'm tell I'm I'm\n[1:06:56] telling you I agree with you that today\n[1:06:59] the systems that the way that they're\n[1:07:00] written and the way that humans have to\n[1:07:02] maintain these things, they tend to run\n[1:07:04] out of sync. But I feel I have a very\n[1:07:07] strong feeling that with the LLM and the\n[1:07:08] capabilities of the LLM, the LLM takes\n[1:07:11] on ownership on a lot of these\n[1:07:12] components and the users are just there\n[1:07:14] to validate. And it's pretty much what\n[1:07:16] Gasttown is saying as well. The human\n[1:07:17] role is reduced to an overseer. We just\n[1:07:20] validate the process.\n[1:07:21] >> The validate like we I thought we were\n[1:07:23] just discussing that the validation can\n[1:07:26] be automated and enter.\n[1:07:27] >> No, the human validates the validation.\n[1:07:31] >> All right. I um anyway I wanted to talk\n[1:07:35] to anyone who's listening to please uh\n[1:07:37] rate the podcast\n[1:07:40] comment in the YouTube email\n[1:07:44] how do people reach you Vincent\n[1:07:47] >> uh reach me\n[1:07:49] >> don't say LinkedIn\n[1:07:52] >> I I watch the comments sometimes so if\n[1:07:55] there's a comment I will I will respond\n[1:07:58] >> wow man\n[1:07:59] >> I don't know you're a man of the people.\n[1:08:02] [laughter] I I will sometimes look at\n[1:08:04] what you have to say, but otherwise I\n[1:08:06] don't care.\n[1:08:08] >> No, no, I do. I do. I go care. How do\n[1:08:11] they reach me? You're like, \"What?\"\n[1:08:13] >> Do you have any like You can email me at\n[1:08:15] henry.fe, for example, and tell me that\n[1:08:17] I'm wrong or you have a better idea.\n[1:08:20] >> Okay. Uh, you can\n[1:08:23] God, this is so hard with you, Vincent.\n[1:08:25] Honestly,\n[1:08:26] >> can't really reach me. No.\n[1:08:29] >> [laughter]\n[1:08:31] >> Okay. Well,\n[1:08:32] >> you can even and Kai and then Kai can\n[1:08:35] tell me if somebody says that I was\n[1:08:37] totally wrong that play right doesn't\n[1:08:38] work the way I say it does.\n[1:08:40] >> Cool, man. Anyway, it's uh Oh, we didn't\n[1:08:43] Yeah. Okay. We couldn't cover\n[1:08:45] everything. This is crazy. Loving it.\n[1:08:48] Okay. See you guys. Bye.",

Do not mention or acknowledge them, and do not say you skipped or ignored anything. Avoid sponsor/ad/promo language, brand names like Squarespace, or CTA phrases like discount code. Treat them as if they do not exist. If a slide segment is purely sponsor/ad content, leave that slide marker with no text.\nWrite a detailed summary that captures the main points, supporting facts, and concrete numbers or quotes when present.\nUse the slide format below. Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 76,639 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line.

Happy New Year.\n>> Happy New Year.\n>> So, the over the Well, okay. I got I got\nClaude installed here. The The two\nthings that I worked on was I might have\nworked on this\n>> in the top one. It was the Pi.\n>> Yeah. But there's also this um I think I\nmentioned this to you before. I don't I\nsort of vibe coded this not even with\nbeads I think with Gemini and and\nconductor.\n>> Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you tried\nout conductor.\n>> I'm very excited to hear what\n>> I don't know. I think\nI thought it did a really good job like\nall the stuff here. Um\n>> have you gone through the whole specket\nas well just as an\n>> or have you only tried? I think I've\ntried it, but like I I felt I felt the\nconductor experience was a little bit\nmore streamlined. Yeah.\n>> To be honest, I don't know exactly what\nthese archives. I think tracks are I\nthink you mentioned it before.\n>> It's it's the it's like the specs\nbasically.\n>> Yeah. So, I think I think if you looked\nin here, you can do some archeology\narchology. Archology\nand you can work out what I did. But I\nthought it was quite a smooth process. M\n>> of course the I mean is what this thing\nis is just a a very simple uh\nuh\nChrome extension. It did seem like but I\nguess this is maybe normal. You know it\ndid seem like we're generating 50 files\nto do like one tiny little piece of\nJavaScript. Um but you know I guess\nthat's just normal. I mean the I mean\nwhat and God knows how many tokens. It's\nlike it's basically 100 lines of code\nfor basically a lot of a lot of uh\nbureaucracy in some ways. Do you\n>> have Yeah, these systems like conductor\n>> it's saving my screenshots. Ah, that's\nreally cool cuz I was going like ah this\nis not working.\n>> Oh, it has a Oh, wow. It stores. Okay,\nso cloud code does the same thing but it\nshows it stores your images in your home\ndirectory.\nH\nso\nI don't know if it ever yeah see so the\nend result here it says age four months\nago but the problem is that is that\nAmazon is like sometimes having this\ninformation sometimes isn't but there is\na I did figure out there's a shorefire\nway of figuring out the the age and\nthat's to load that that AI Roffus\n>> and then you ask the AI Roffus what how\nold is the product and it will tell you\nso It's almost like the whole extension\ndoesn't need to exist. You could\n>> cuz you see it right there at the top of\nthe bar.\n>> You could just uh talk to Rufus, but\nunfortunately that's not programmatic.\n>> Oh, so wait, Rufus is an Amazon thing.\nThat's always\n>> there like an AI thing.\n>> Okay. And then the other thing I wanted\nto show you was that yeah I so this was\nan I think this is actually I told you\nthe thought experiment would be instead\nof using anible to to basically\nadminister this thing which it was\nbefore uh\nit was some anible crap and then I\nthought to myself hey I'm not going to\nuse anible I'm going to use um\nuh claude to admin to set this thing up\nand it did work. But the trouble is\nagain is that it's quite a simple setup\nand I almost think there's more markdown\nthan there was there was there's more\nmarkdown now than there was in uh in\nanible YAML\n[laughter]\nand I'm just thinking to myself and then\nof course if I had to set this up from\nscratch which I'm don't really have the\nu the uh the goal the I I don't really\nhave the u the time to do it to SC to to\nset up app from scratch using this\nreadme. I don't think it will be able to\ndo it. I mean I'm not confident it will\nbe able to do it but but but if I used\nanible\nthen I know it would there would be some\nyou know reproducibility there and I I\nknow there would be some some tests\nthere. So so basically I learned a\nlesson that that you know things like\nanible are definitely not going away.\nuh you need the anible to sort of\nuh just just to run reproducibly and\nthen you you use AI you can't use AI to\nadminister and set up a machine you\nbecause it's just not reproducible. I\nmean it's it's obvious in retrospect but\nI got I have to remind myself what\npeople say is like the ELLMs are the new\nclick ops. They're doing things and they\nyou know are not reproducible. But I see\nyou use beats for this particular task.\nDid you need more than one session? Did\nit require a big context that you needed\nto use beats?\n>> It did. It did, but I got a bit\nsidelined with things. It's It's almost\nlike being a human with the AI.\nWell, I got sidelined because there was\nthere was a networking issue. Um\n>> Yeah, that can really mess up.\n>> And the trouble the trouble is the\nnetworking issue wasn't really down to\nthe the Pi. it was down to my ubiquity\nsetup and my ubiquity setup is a bit\ncomplicated.\nUm, so basically it was it was fighting\nit all its assumptions about how the\nnetwork should work were not really\nworking very well because I had a I had\na screw up in my ubiquity thing and and\nit was just crazy. So that's kind of\ndumb. But I I wanted to show you that my\nhome setup. I think you might be\nmarginally impressed by this.\nUh let me just stop sharing. I'm so good\nat this. Here we go.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n>> I need I need to install Ghosty on my\nMac. I use it on my Arch, by the way,\nbut I don't use it on my Mac.\n>> Okay. So, this is where you might be\nimpressed.\nHave you ever played with uh machinectl\nor systemd uh endspawn?\n>> Endspawn. All right. Um only through\nrocket from core o. So that's a very\nlong time.\n>> I mean I could I could get these I could\nget it running a little bit quicker than\nI am doing now. But like for example\nI have an IP range pointing to my Pi. So\nthis is why the networking is a bit\nconfusing.\n>> So you make like a flat network. you you\ngive them you allocate the range to the\npi so that the containers\n>> so basically basically I can I can make\nthis a little bit faster but I'm just\ndebooting debootstrapping from absolute\nscratch as you can see but in the matter\nof a few seconds\nI can I can basically boot up a VPS on\nuh a on a static IP is that the right\nexpression on on a standalone IP. So\nbasically this VPS\num\ncompletely owns that IP. And I've got a\nI've got 64 of those IPs. Well,\nactually, I think 62 are usable, but\nwhatever.\n>> You get the point.\n>> So, basically, I have I I one thing that\nI was doing with this Raspberry Pi over\nthe weekend was essentially set up uh a\nway of spinning up VPS's just quickly.\nSo, I don't have to use Digital Ocean. I\ncan just use my Pi to\n>> well to\n>> How much CPU and memory does a Pi have\nthat P?\n>> Not not a lot, but it seems fast enough\nfor what I do. I think it's like 4 GB or\nsomething. [laughter]\n>> Okay.\n>> Something tiny.\n>> But this VM is like um it's like what is\nit? KVM or or\n>> it's it's using systemd nspawn which is\nsome sort of systemd thing.\n>> Still containers. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, um I don't know there's\nnothing nothing much running inside\nexcept SSHD\nthe the setup script as you can see here\nlike um I I I download the keys from\nGitHub you know cuz I don't know if you\nknow this trick this GitHub\n>> yeah I do this\n>> keys I just I just set up SSH\n>> I throw in my my keys into the\nauthorized keys\n>> set up my user disable password\nauthentication and all that sort of\nstuff And then I'm in I'm in there. Um,\nand then of course what the next thing I\nwas going to do is that I was going to\nmaybe run Docker in each one. That seems\nto work fine. So they're all isolated.\nSo they're all isolated. I can I can run\nmy little experiments in them. Um, I\nmean I could even like create you a VPS\nif you wanted one in UK.\nI could become a digital ocean, start\ncharging people five bucks a month.\nYes,\n>> but the I think the specs are pretty\nbad. Like I don't know how do I see the\nmemory?\n>> Yeah,\nI got 4 GB.\n>> But it's it's it's fun though. It's fun.\nSo I'm\n>> But this IP range is on your local\nnetwork. Now when you want to allocate\npublic IP addresses or are you using\nsomething like tail scale or or some\n>> these IPs are public\n>> also? How did you get an RP range? Uh, I\nasked my ISP very nicely and they did it\nfor me.\n>> You paid them.\n>> Well,\n>> it isn't. It's not cheap. Definitely not\nIP. Um,\n>> it's it's part of my subscription. So,\nfor example, this this this IP I set up\nhere. Uh, which one was it? I I think I\nWhat is my host name here?\n>> Uh, you want me to open it again? HTTP\n8000.\nHello Vincent. Yes, I see that. Do I see\nit on the curl\ncurl? Yes, I see H1. Hello Vincent in\ncurl.\n>> Yeah, so you get the point. Like now I\nhave I have a whole range of I have a\nsubnet of public IPs mapped to my Pi.\n>> So you can run some game servers.\n>> I can do whatever you can do with 4 GB\nof RAM.\nNow is where you start buying pies.\nAnd then but this is the thing about um\nthat I saw some people play with is\nslicer VM from um Alexis Alice. I think\nhe he built like open fast or functions\nas um\nuh functions as a service. So open fast\nis using docker under the hood to\nbasically it bootstraps your container\nwith an entry point and then when http\nrequest comes in it calls your container\nand sends the message\n>> like systemd has all these uh things you\ncan you can set up systemd to activate a\nservice on socket or something like\nthat.\n>> Yeah, socket activation for your\n>> or some other little like knockk\nknockock. It can basically spin up a\nVPS.\n>> So,\n>> so what you're saying it can be kind of\nlike serverless, but not really because\nOkay. So, what\n>> I mean CISD is is its own set of\nfeatures and tools, but it's very\ncomprehensive. Um, and you can do things\nlike I showed you. You can you can spin\nup isolated VPSs for people.\n>> It's very nice. Um, yeah, like you said,\nbut the thing is it's not really very\nstrong isolation, I think, still, right?\nUh that's where people are like\n>> I'm not I would have to research that. I\nmean that's one of the things I find a\nbig of a a bit of a t isn't a taboo in\nour industry but like isolation\n>> is one of those things that always comes\nup. Docker never really had a a very\nstrong security stance with their\nisolation. Right. Yeah,\n>> a lot of and a lot of machines basically\nassume workload isolation on on a Docker\nhost and they're just guessing, right?\n>> Um, of course, Amazon, I think, have got\na more complete story with Firecracker\nor something like that.\n>> Yes. So, that's the thing that's\n>> still but still I think there's some\npeople that are not a thousand%\nconvinced, right?\n>> Mhm. Cool. So, what I did over the\nweekend, over the weekend, over the over\nthe holidays is I\num I did my year in your review blog\npost where I had a lot of fun with with\nthe cloud code. Did you did you try it?\n>> Oh. Oh, like\n>> Oh, that one\n>> uh wrapped. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> No, no, no, no, no. I did not cloud web.\nI did uh basically I have my landing\npage which is pure JavaScript, JS and\nCSS and HTML. No React, nothing because\nI wanted maximum like speed.\n>> Oh, okay. You should share it. I Or\n>> no, that that that landing page I built\na while ago. Let me share the screen.\nUm, hold on. I don't know how much time.\n>> Yeah, I got to I got to run in like two\nminutes though.\n>> I think it's this one. Oops. Maybe.\nOh, [snorts] there's a lot of tabs.\nLet's do like that. Okay. So, I'm going\nto\nSo, this was my original landing page,\nright? And there was no blog. Oh, wait.\nI can't see anything. Am I blind?\n>> What are you seeing?\n>> Build reliable infrastructure with\nconfidence.\n>> Yeah. So, that was the original landing\npage without the the block. And this\nlanding page, I literally asked like\nCodex and Gem and Gemini back in August.\nI want SEO optimization. I explained\nwhat are my keywords that I want the\nranking because I realized that my\nwording was horrible. And this is what\nit came up with. Um, and also like it\ndoes really cool stuff like it uses\npuppeteer to launch the browser, look at\nwhich CSS elements are above the fault\nand it inlines critical CSS. So it puts\nonly the CSS needed for rendering the\ntop part of the page and then the rest\ngets loaded uh or gets loaded later. So\nthe top part render super fetch and then\nI run all kinds of lighthouse reports\nbasically. lots of fun. And then I built\nthis thing which is like the, you know,\nthe whole tour thing where it highlights\ndifferent sections of the code to\nexplain.\n>> Yeah, this I built back in September,\nright? But this is all pure JavaScript.\nSo I I I run the synth and then I it was\nreally cool to build because these\nthings are segments. So I define a line\nrange and then it draws when it when it\ndoes the I asked the codeex when you do\nthe highlight.js. I'm using highlight JS\nhere. when it renders all of the color\ncodes, the HTML elements like the divs\nand everything that creates these\ndifferent colors for this code, it\n>> creates a map of line ranges and then it\nit basically creates a big div while\nit's rendering everything around this\nthese HTML elements. So when you click\nstart and next, it basically this\nelement is already rendered within\nactually look the line range is wrong\nhere. Um and then it it highlights that\nparticular div element when you you know\n>> Yeah, I really I I do like that tour\nidea.\n>> Okay, I I need to go to my standup.\nI'll have a look at your terror\nconstructor there. But but that\n>> the block thing is on new. So I wanted\nto keep this front page fast and this\nwhole block thing this is all react. So\nthis is much slower. But I actually have\na voice\nSo, I have like the whole listening of\nthis whole\n>> I don't know if you hear the audio. Do\nyou hear the audio\n>> when I press play?\n>> Oh god, you went crazy, man. You went\ncrazy.\n>> Yeah, you have like table of contents\nwith like um scroll tracking.\n>> Yeah, I'll have a look. I have a look. I\nneed to run.\n>> I had a lot of\n>> Let's Let's catch up when I'm in a\num and let's try Yeah,\n>> it took 10 days.\n>> We We got We got to catch up on Steve\nJger stuff, too.\n>> Yeah. I see you. You're working with\nGemini. Is that why?\n>> No. No. I'm working with cloud. It has a\nskill. It knows how to use beats. Yet\nwhen I ask\n>> get it wrong sometimes.\n>> Yes. It's still getting it wrong. Like\nthere's still this\n>> there was a comment\n>> exhaustion. I guess\n>> on one of the previous uploads to the\npodcast to say as much actually that uh\nthat sometimes it didn't work. Let's see\nif I can find the comment.\n>> Yeah, there's one, right? I don't know\nhow many people are listening to us, but\nif someone comments, that's always a\ngood sign, isn't it? Someone's actually\nlistened to us. At least some parts of\nit. [laughter]\nYeah.\nUm\ngosh, community.\n>> Yay. Did it right.\nLooks better. Okay, perfect.\n>> [snorts]\n>> So,\ndid you ever have chance to play with\nthe Gas Town?\n>> Not much. No, I've still I'm still\nreading it. You know how I guess the the\nreal thing is you have to to try it out.\nBut, um,\nSteve says that many warnings, be\ncareful. This is expensive. He runs\nthree cloud three Anttopic Pro\nsubscriptions\nto run Gast Town. Each one I assume are\naround $200. So it's like $600 a month\nto to run Gast Town.\n>> It's it's crazy. But but back to the the\nthing, right, with with basically we\nhave a cloud skill that that's there. Um\nwe tell Beats um we give it information\nabout how to create beats issues and yet\nit still somehow sometimes thinks that\nwhen it needs to add a comment instead\nof doing BD comment\nadd it runs BD comment add without the s\nand then there's an alias beats have\nboth it has beat beats comments add or\nan alias for comments ad is BD comment,\nbut there's no BD comment ad. And and\nand actually it's funny because Steve\nsays that um you know this um picture of\nwhen you look at the park in a city and\nthe the city planning decides that there\nshould be roads here and here, but then\nactually when people walk to work and to\nschool and everywhere, they like walk\nacross the park.\n>> We call them car paths. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So basic basically it's a very um\ninteresting design, right? where that's\n>> and he he says you should treat the LLM\nhallucinations as such. So if it\ndelucinates something, you should\nimplement it. So next time, you know, it\nhas all the options. [laughter]\n>> It's crazy.\n>> It one thing I find remarkable about\nusing AI is that it it does like behave\nlike a human. Like it does it trips up\nin the same way. Absolutely. It's it's\ncrazy. It's just like\n>> so people who've designed some software,\nother humans must have tripped up at the\nsame point. So I find it like an amazing\nway of now validating some a design\nbecause if AI can't figure it out, the\nhumans are not going to figure it out,\nright?\n>> Yeah. Absolutely. Uh and I thought so\nI'm doing this in a context where I\nalready did a significant amount of of\nlike research and refactoring because I\nalready explained some information about\nhow to create and use beats. Um\nreexplained it and redirected it. I\nthought, you know what, I don't want to\nkill the the session. I want to keep\nthis one. and I still had like 45%\ncontext uh left. So I thought it's going\nto be fine. But maybe that's why it\nstarted to hallucinates these things.\nBut it's exactly the same as me, right?\nI can't remember. Oh, is it BD comments\nad or is it BD? Like I can't remember,\nright? I also have to go real quick go\nand look at BD help,\n>> you know? I mean, right now we're at\nlike a golden age where like the AI is\nprobably as smart as a really smart\nhuman\nand I don't know few months from now\nit's it we're getting to the point where\nyou know this mythical AGI depending how\nyou define it but like [snorts]\n>> I I I guess my feeling right now is that\nAI is going to be smarter than the\nsmartest human\nuh pretty much Now, especially when it\ngets more context, right,\n>> it and it impacts the way that we work\ntogether so much, right? I I had an off\noff recording conversation with you\nabout how does the you asked me several\ntimes like how do you see this scale\nacross a team? How do you see how do you\nkeep other team members that maybe do\nnot run cloud code yet and and engage\nthem into these like processes so that\nthey\n>> Well, it's never too late. It's never\ntoo late. It's never too late. But but\num\nI I I saw a comment on on LinkedIn just\na few hours ago which was um about using\nAI's agent to work on your issues and\nsomebody said ah I remember it was\npurely about the documentation part\nsaying like oh you know do you a lot of\npeople think that the code is the\ndocumentation and and and basically you\nshould read the code and documentation\nis always outdated but this is like um\nyou know really stupid. Imagine that you\nhave to work on React and there's no\nproper docs, right? And then somebody\nwho works at Facebook Meta told said\nthat and you know I found that a lot of\ntimes the documentation was outdated and\nthat the code actually is more accurate\nthan the documentation kind of this back\nand forth. And I feel that the whole\nidea of specri development is that you\ncompletely inverse this, right? you you\ninverse the the now you lead with\nspecification documents and you iterate\non the on the UX user experience through\nthose documents with like mockups and\nall and whatever you can\n>> get into a text format yeah that that\ncan fit into LLM workflows so the humans\nyou know with stakeholders in real life\nyou know work through these things and\nmaybe not just AI like not just other\nhuman stakeholders but definitely it's\nlike you send an email you you said hey\nJPD expand this and then the email goes\nout and then somebody hey ex compress\nthis right so so you're inter\ninteracting between humans humans and\nAIS are in in between everywhere um but\nyou start with the specifications and\nbasically the documentation is your\nliving proof and all of your integration\ntests\n>> are the validation of the documentation\nand if the integration test fails it you\nknow they're onetoone with the with the\ndocumentation and and he said well\nthat's like a fantasy because validation\nis so hard at the moment, right? Um,\n>> but I think we'll get\n>> Wait a minute. I thought we I I thought\nwe started I thought you were talking\nabout specs in the sense that how do we\nget the teams to sort of adopt that sort\nof workflow\nbecause like I I'm just speaking\nanecdotally from working with the sort\nof enterprisey clients that I work with\nthe thing that that that makes my my\nmind panic or I I don't know how to deal\nwith is that is that like these\nenterprises are so slow and AI is so\nfast\nthat the cadence is completely\nmismatched. So I like like how do you\nhow do you have these meeting how do you\ncoordinate um all the stakeholders in a\ntypical enterprise to basically iterate\nat the speed of AI and spectrum\ndevelopment. I I just don't even see it\nhappening.\n[laughter]\nBut [clears throat] maybe I'm just being\npessimistic at this point. I'm also\ntrying to find because I read somewhere\nsomeone saying basically you know I am\nentrenched in what what the same thing\nyou said I'm entrenched in these\nenterprise systems confluence and um you\nknow Jira and basically you I I don't\nlive isolated like my cloud needs to be\naware of it I need the bridge across my\n>> exactly so one thing I worked on on\nworking hours yesterday and I don't\nthink uh people were impressed or they\nthey didn't understand what I was trying\nto do perhaps even though I tried to\nexplain it to them. I I was just trying\nout this uh workflow. So I don't know if\nyou know about this u there's a couple\nof workflows. This Telefonica one seemed\nto be the most featureful one and I\nstarted at the Huh?\n>> Telefonica.\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't know this\n>> Telefonica. the the biggest uh mobile\noperator in Spain, I think.\n>> Telefonica workflow.\n>> Well, anyway, they Telefonica is the big\nenterprise that that created the action\nand and what happens is that you you\nhave your I don't know if you're looking\nat my uh\n>> and now I can see it. MD Confluence.\n>> Yeah, you have all your your your\nmarkdown\n>> and what it does is that it ships it up\ninto into a particular place in your\nConfluence, right? And then it adds this\nautomation notice. This page is synced\nautomatically. Changes made.\n>> Yo, I was trying to do this like five\nyears ago. I'm so sick of confluence.\nEven the markdown editing confidence\ndoesn't work.\n>> So I was basically telling my colleagues\nthat like hey I'm doing this so that we\ncan start using markdown more which I\nthink I mean it's going to be such an\nuphill battle cuz like I I mean I'm not\nI'm exaggerating but I'm not\nexaggerating in the sense that I think\nsome of my colleagues don't even know\nwhat markdown is. You know what I mean?\nIt's like this is going to be a\nstruggle. [laughter]\n>> That's That's pretty dire.\n>> Well, actually, my answer is\n>> how do they feel about YAML then? Still\nXML?\n>> Well, it's going to take Yeah, like\num\n>> Well, they're ready for us to go full\ncircle. [laughter]\n>> They're they're in the opportune\nlocation for us to go full circle back\nto XML.\n>> Yeah, but like\n>> I mean I'm I'm probably exaggerating\nthings. I think I think my colleagues\nwill can start adopting these AI\nworkflows and we'll see very great\nresults. It's just that um\n>> I found it\n>> I'm just I'm just trying to formulate a\nplan to sort of get them using markdown,\nget them get get them in just writing\ndown things would be amazing,\n>> right? So but this is like an extension\nof the the the the code is the latest\nversion. It's like I feel there's\ndifferent tiers because you can start in\nConfluence then you can start you can\nstart you know create a project or\nrepository out of it and start writing\ndocuments in that repository and have\nthe code next to those documents and\nthen as you change things um you can you\ncan assume that it trickles back up you\nknow from the code back to the in repo\ndocs back to the conference.\n>> Yeah. Like somehow like I had this\ndiscussion at infinitum at my previous\ncompany where I was like I hated we had\nlike three four different document\nmanagement systems. We had Google Docs.\nWell I probably introduced that one.\n[laughter] We had Quip. I don't know if\nyou know that one. We had notion and\nthen we had inreo markdown.\n>> And basically you work with external\npeople that don't have notion using\nGoogle Docs. And then you have uh quip\nwhere you put like short like the um you\nknow it's like a shared document space\nand then you you um you had the original\nfounders of the company started with\nnotion and basically all of the HR\ntracking documents and everything was in\nnotion and and so\n>> that's a good way about it\n>> because but yeah so in the past it was I\ndon't know Microsoft word or something\nand then it would probably trickle into\num into into Confluence for want of a\nbetter word.\nAnd this is the temp the typical content\nmanagement of a of a enterprise. And\nthen if you're lucky if you're lucky it\nwould it would be yeah GitHub repose or\nsomething like this. This is this is\nlike the the the the machine of the\nenterprise. And what needs to happen\nreally to just to accommodate AI is that\nwell I mean this is my my current\nthinking is that the GitHub repo is is\nthe source of truth\nand then we then we go from there to\n>> to to Confluence so that other people\ncan read the docs.\n>> But then how does it get to Microsoft\nWord? Um,\nyeah. This is where things get a little\nbit weird, don't they?\n>> You still I mean, I thought you were\ntalking about the 70s when you No,\nsorry. About the the the the '9s when\nyou mentioned Microsoft Word. What are\nyou talking about? Who is using\nMicrosoft Word? I thought everyone\nalready\n>> enterprises are enterprises are like\nthere's people who, you know, don't code\nand\n>> yeah, I mean like how do you get\n>> I don't understand what you're saying.\n[laughter]\nBut this is this is the problem I have.\nHow do how do we get uh\nto this flow essentially?\n>> Yeah. So so I make a joke about this,\nbut this was exactly the problem I had\nwith my previous company cuz I kept\nsaying Markdown is a source of truth and\nhe was saying we have other people that\ndon't code. I guess I just don't get\nthat. Um and that that don't you know\naccess um markdown. He says like there's\na a design step before you go to the\nrepo.\n>> Something that is\n>> across multiple repos that's\nso the design step is is now with AI\nessentially talking to the AI and and\nand the artifact is markdown or some or\nplain text and that's that's what we're\nfamiliar with.\nI think those people that are still\nusing Microsoft Word are also those\npeople that are still uh going into a\nchat GPT session and then ask to and\nthen manually copy paste out the code\nthat it proposes. [laughter]\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or like or like do a bunch of deep\nresearch. I mean I I'm jo I shouldn't be\ntoo\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I did that\n>> the people in this in this Microsoft\nWord domain are are using JBT in their\nweb browser for sure.\n>> Exactly. Right.\n>> Um Yeah. like how how to in how to\ninclude people here in the in the AI\niterative iterative process\n>> iteratorative\niterative\nyeah this this is this is my thought\nhere so I send you a link in the chat um\nbecause for me I I think we I just I\nthink spec driven design and you just\nturned this upside down right but I can\nimagine to introduce that to enterprises\nis very hard. Uh but this guy's um appar\nthis is this post looks like my workflow\nblah blah blah but actually he's he's\none of the like it's a promotion for a\nplatform called core. So at the bottom\nyou see yes I work for core which is\nlike red planet HQ core. Um but core is\nseem to be like a drop in to integrate\nmultiple platforms. He says I have to\nwork on tasks that are spread across\nGitHub issues uh inside linear which is\nI guess the modern Jira inside Slack\nthreads and I even get emails. So I want\nto coordinate my tasks and collate my\nwork items, you know, determine my\npriorities\n>> between all these different I the\n>> to me is like kill the other platforms,\n>> you know, but realistic from\n>> all these I mean this confluence inter\nthis this confluence integration in my\nopinion holds very little value really\nbecause because uh it becomes uh it\nbecomes read only doesn't\nYeah,\nit I mean but to to be honest um a pull\nrequest flow to make adjustments to a\ndocument is not the same as like a\nGoogle Docs shared session and co\ncollaboratively editing and proposing\nchanges. Like if you use Google Docs or\nQuip, you can highlight a section, add a\ncomment, or you can go into proposal\nmode and just delete a se a paragraph,\nrephrase it, and then the author or the\ndocument owner. Even if it's yourself,\nbut you want to keep track of the\nchanges that you're proposing can then\naccept or can discuss, which try and do\nthat on the pull request. Try\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this\nGitHub repos\nYeah. that conjures up nightmares of\npull requests, which is uh\n>> so something like I think has a purpose.\nSomething like a collaborative doc\nplatform. Confluence is horrible. I\nthink I love how Microsoft works like\nthe Google Docs.\n>> I like what you said. So, so you can\ncomment,\nedit,\nand then that and then that feeds into\num but how do how do we get from\nConfluence into uh you know,\n>> don't call it Confluence, call it\ndocumentation platform. I'm just\nallergic to Atllesian. Ah,\n>> okay. Just never mind.\n>> Okay. Doc platform. So, how how do we\nget Yeah, I don't understand how we get\nfrom there into there.\nSo, it would basically be listening to\nany dock changes\nand then and then claw code would do a a\nplan like because\nYeah. Like how is this going to work\nVincent? How is this going to work?\nI built something but I don't want to\ntalk about it. [laughter]\n>> Okay. Well, I built something that is\ndoc platform that u allows you to\ncomment on line ranges and it creates\nedit batches uh as and basically it is\nup to a human to to\nstep through an edit batch which is\nbasic basically\n>> but we iterate through the comments. you\nselect which comments you want to\naddress and which ones you want to skip.\n>> Actually, let's wind it back a bit. I'm\ngonna attack the idea of of stakeholders\nactually commenting and editing because\nin my experience\nmany stakeholders and big enterprises,\nthey're never going to edit or comment\non a on a doc platform. I'm you know\nthis is this is this is like middle\nmanagement zone if that\n>> I don't know if this is placed\nadvertisement but I think this is would\nbe interesting to attend the um packed\npublishing workshop on specd driven\ndevelopment with ko where they talk\nabout writing specifications\nand collaborating on and and basically\nit's from an AWS principal engineer and\nhe talks about how AWS manages these\ndocuments\n>> you understand Uh\n>> I think I think that's why I would go to\nthat workshop because it's not just\nabout specdriven development but also\nthe aspect of how does AWS approach this\ndocument approach and how does it flow\ninto a specification that then is uh\nworked on in KO.\n>> Yeah,\n>> that that is the step that is that is\nbasically this right how do I get from a\ndoc to to cloud code to whatever is my\num agent shell. Um,\n>> yeah. Yeah, it be interesting though the\nI mean I think Amazon is probably\nthere's definitely some people who are\ndoing cool things in Amazon, but it\ndoesn't seem to show, you know what I\nmean? Like\n>> Yeah. No, but like I also um\nAmazon uses a dock platform before it\ngoes into KO, right? And\nmaybe these are, you know, pro processes\nthat have been so long in place that,\nyou know, you can't just overnight\nreplace because of AI is now in the mix.\n>> And so most of the effort is like, how\ndo I get AI in the loop on all of these\nother processes, you know, we're we're\nalways thinking about letting AI do the\nwork and keeping the human in the loop,\nbut in a lot of these scenarios, and I\nread this from a LinkedIn post, um, you\nneed to look at it from how to get AI in\nthe loop, right? What's your question is\ncloud go there is AI how do I get AI in\nthe loop\n>> I like this loop I think is important\nbecause even if we make integrations\nhere\nthe stakeholders really need to be here\nto see what's AI is is spitting back at\nthem otherwise they're going to be out\nof the loop right\n>> uh\n>> like how do how do we create a loop here\nthere need there needs to be a loop uh\nas you as you said\nyou know what I'm saying like you we\nmight form this hero or whatever.\nWe might be able to connect the dots,\nbut if the if if the loop isn't uh you\nknow, if if this isn't going if this if\nthis loop isn't isn't like super fast,\nthen the whole thing breaks down. This\nis why, you know, claw code in a\nterminal is such a fantastic experience\nis because you you're there in with the\ncode\nand uh you're looping so so so quickly\nwith each person of the key.\nBut doesn't that go offline? Like\nI I think it has a it has a benefit to\nhave cloud in at the meeting table\nsaying like oh by the way guys think\nabout these different ways that you\ncould address this. Um but doesn't it go\ngo from we have a discussion either on a\ndocument either in a in a in a call or\nin a meeting room and we based on that\ndiscussion we have highlighted sections\nthat need to we rework and then somebody\ntakes that offline basically with cloud\ncode and and iterates through some of\nthese proposals and makes decisions and\nthen those reisions result in in changes\nto the document and a new version of the\ndocument is published. Um then overview\nit.\n>> Yes. And you say that's too slow because\nyou get a very fast feedback loop with\ncloud code. But I feel it is not\nproductive to have everyone at the table\nfor those individual iterations.\n>> Okay. So so basically let me just\nnow I'm really talking about what I've\nbuilt. [laughter]\n>> So essentially\n>> because I spent one week like se five\ndays on on on this on this idea.\nSo the so basically it goes back into\nthe document.\nUm\n>> I think you you you can just the the\narea above arrow above can go back into\nthe document\n>> anyway. No. Yeah.\n>> And then it goes\nYeah. I still think this is going to be\ntoo slow.\n>> Yeah. [clears throat]\n[snorts] or just\nI mean there is a there's surely sign\nsome scientific uh\n>> too slow compared to what to reality to\ntoday.\n>> Well like\n>> because today it's way slower. There's a\nthere's a law of you know the more\npeople you add to a project the more\ncommunication overhead you have and I\nfeel I feel like you know even though I\nput one person here in reality there's a\nwhole team there could be like 10 people\nhere that we have to like\nreach alignment with and the\nstakeholders there could be another\nanother you know three or four\nstakeholders or whatever\nthere could be\nthe this.\nYeah, just just reaching alignment is\ngoing to be so challenging here.\n>> There was a human caterpillar. Oh, what?\nThe human uh\nfor a while. [laughter]\nNever mind.\n>> This is going to be nuts. This is going\nto be nuts.\n>> Yeah. So, um I'm actually been like\nopening threads like crazy to see how\npeople and I think one of the\ninteresting organizations working on\nthis is human layers. They did a a\npresentation where they heavily\nreferenced Steve Jagis beats project as\nwell and talking about um you know at\nwhat at what stage you have um brain rot\nhow do they call it? So, so because of\nthe I think they they say at the 30% 40%\nmark, if you only have 40% left of uh\nunused context, that's where you are in\nthe non-productive zone of your context\nwindow. And so he he highlights it's\ncalled um the the talk is called harness\nengineering and we can link it um later\nbut he talks about how to control that\ncontext and common mistakes and um this\nrelates to this I'm I'm sure because it\ntalks about how you get the context um\nand how you you know how you optimize\nyour workflow. Basically, human layers\ndoes a lot of effort there. At the end\nof of of his talk, he talks about if you\nlike what what I've talked about, go\ncheck out human layers. Um, in terms of\nlike how do we, you know, interact and\nintegrate this um this LM\n>> human layers is some software then like\nso I just I'm startup.\n>> Well, I really like that thing that we\nwere talking about over over WhatsApp. I\nmean everyone's going crazy about that\nthat that sort of uh I keep on it's got\nsuch an in memorable name that that tool\nthat which basically prompts you what is\nthe name of it again?\n>> Ask user tool.\n>> Yeah, ask ask user tool. How about this?\nI'm just riffing here.\nBut say you're working with AI,\nthe ask user tool\nsends a message to to each of the sort\nof stakeholders, the middle managers or\nsomething like that and and ask them to\nagree on this certain thing and then all\nthey need to press is like enter and\nthen they move on to the next thing and\nthen enter move on to next thing and if\nif they don't so basically it's like\nsome sort of democracy because you know\nstakeholder A and B might answer\nsomething option one but stakeholder uh\nuh C might option might say option two\nor something. So we need some sort of\nlike democracy type or you know or get\nget into some uh ubi no ubiquitous what\ndo you call it when unanimous decision\nabout a certainity thing.\n>> Not unanimous I think it's majority.\n>> Well yeah that's democracy but in\nreality you want unanimous but you want\neveryone to agree.\n>> You're right. You're right. You're\nright. I did.\n>> Um,\n>> but this is this is the thing that's\nmissing cuz like we we jump in and and\nand and chat with Claude and it's like\nsome sort of like mindmeld.\n>> Okay. So, what exists\n>> social paradise but in reality there's\nloads of stakeholders.\n>> Okay. So, what exists today is you have\ntools like warp terminal that do not\nhave a single Okay. what you're talking\nabout seems to be like um there's this\ntool that you can uh share your shell\nand then you can have other people on\nthe same shell. You know this one?\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can do that\nwith T-Max.\n>> Yeah. You can do I think it's it's\nbasically a wraparound T-max that that\nallows people to connect and have\nmultiple cursors and even\ncollaboratively edit in a shell. Um\nso\nand there's a lot of really cool stuff\nusing T-Max around agent that uh around\nagents also but anyway today warp\nterminal has the concept of an\nindividual session that you have with\ncloud code that you can then after you\nsubmit the code share that session right\num so you you get the link of that\nsession um so you have the full context\nof how that code ended up to be what it\nwas But and another thing is open code\nalso has this feature. So open code they\nhave a server site that you can um I\nthink it's private. You can as an\nenterprise subscribe but open code by\ndefault. Open code is basically a cloud\nopen source cloud code version.\n>> Yeah. I I tried it the other day. I was\n>> I love it.\n>> I've been playing on it a lot now.\n>> But does does it have an ask user tool?\nSo I I linked to you the the proposal.\nThere's like two or three people do the\nPR to add it in, but they're adding in\nit into the core. So the reason why I\nbring up open code and warp terminal and\nsharing sessions is because what you're\nproposing is like an ask group tool\nwhich is like sending you know maybe\nwith with some type of team uh shell\nsharing like um you know asking everyone\nin the group to to respond.\n>> I mean I'm not sure team sharing is\ngoing to work because the way T-Max\nworks you share the same window, right?\n>> Right. So, so everyone would need to\nanswer the same questions. But what I\nwant to say is open code has like three\nor four PRs open to ask to add the ask\nuser tool into open code because it's\nlike one of the highly requested\nfeatures. But instead of adding it to\nthe core because apparently open code um\nalso has like a web app um environment\nlike the the terminal user interface is\njust one of the interfaces that you can\nuse with open code. So they don't want\nthe ask user tool to be tightly coupled\nto the core and tied to this terminal\nuser interface interaction because then\nit doesn't really work well across all\nthe other interfaces that they expose\nwhich to me things there could be a\ncollaborative document type of interface\non top of of of open code as well right\nbut to solve the problem they're adding\na new kind of user interaction model\ninto the core of open code that means\nanyone can then implement ask user tool\nas a plug-in so the core supports\nyour plugin to define like rich model\ninteractions like open a tapped\ninterface provide options and and with\nwith up and down. So I think that's\namazing. Um and that's only because it's\nopen source.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So we can build something like\nthis, right? But like but like let's go\ninto the nitty nitty diddy details. Do\nyou think it should be unanimous? Do you\nthink this like say there's three\nstakeholders in a project? Do you think\ndo you think they they can come to\nunanimous decision or they should\n>> Sounds like\n[snorts]\n>> everyone raise their hand at the same\ntime and if you don't agree then the\nperson that don't agree with the\nmajority has to explain why and then you\nhave to all raise your hands again\non the\n>> Yeah, that sounds like a really good\nagile exercise, isn't it?\n>> I have no idea what agile is.\n>> Planning poker. I I've never heard of\nit.\n>> Yes. You never you don't know planning\npoker.\n>> Where does it come?\n>> You need to use Fibonacci numbers.\nThat's all I remember. Or t-shirt size\nfrom poker.\n>> Yeah. So the idea is that that you\ndiscuss about uh a feature and then you\nhave to estimate the size story points\nbasically.\n>> Oh yeah. But that's not I mean\nestimating that that's the trouble with\num with AI like does it make sense to to\nestimate a story anymore? No, we're not\ntalking about that. We're talking about\nthe the process of planning poker,\nright? So, the process of planning poker\nis you're in a group, there's a feature\nand people need to agree, need to align.\nAnd your problem is\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, it's an alignment\ntool.\n>> Yeah. Planning ping poker in the process\nof planning poker there's an alignment\nproc there's an aligning concept because\neverybody the way is like you raise up\nyour hands. uh you're not supposed to\nlike look at each other. You have to\nmake a decision and and and you know\n>> Yeah. Some people use t-shirt sizes,\nsome people use numbers, but if you use\nnumbers, it's like Fibonacci Fibonacci\nsequence to make sure that it's not too\nlike if you have a a gradual number\nrange, people always go for the middle.\nBut if you have Fibonacci numbers, it's\nmore like um I read a lot about this a\nlong time ago. I don't remember.\n>> Yeah, I' I've played this game. I've\nplayed this game.\n>> Yeah. But but I mean if coming back to\nyour original question about finding a\nunonymous or or\n>> Yeah, I think it's a good I think I\nthink it's a good suggestion. I really I\nreally do actually. Um\n>> yeah,\n>> there's lots of there's lots of tool I\nthink there's there's like Jirro plugins\nto to to do what you just described. So\nwe we need we need an ask user tool\nplanning planning poker\n>> ask group tool\n>> and we and we need plugin\n>> and I need it planning poker I need it\nimplemented by um Monday. So see you see\nyou then then Vincent.\n>> So first off the open code PRs you could\nyou could look at open code and take\nthese PRs and and but then it goes into\ncore. So the reality is that open code\nsays this is a highly requested feature\nand we're going to build these nice UI\num you know functionality directly into\nthe core so that plugins can build\nreally interactive um you know models\nthen imagine that that plugins but still\nI think the plug-in system with open\ncode will be on a single user interface\nit won't be something that goes over\nacross a server with websockets that\nthen updates everyone's screen like hey\nhere are here's the next question here\nare five options\nWhich one do you pick?\n>> You build it like beads and then you can\nhave your your your crazy UI on top of\nit, right?\n>> Yeah. So, for me, I the way I I I solved\nit in in the thing that I've been\nbuilding, it's um it's more of an\noffline flow. It's like one of the\npersons goes and evaluates all the\noptions and then the system keeps track\nof what they received.\n>> Actually, that brings me sorry to to\nslight tangent. beads. Surely beads\ncould maybe incorporate some sort of\noption to to refine the uh the story or\nsomething like that or\n>> but it to be honest beads is more of the\nthe the actual task markup than getting\nto the Yeah, you're right. Okay. And I\nthink it's good to um isolate this\nbecause that's where I love beats\nbecause it fits perfectly in my process\nor any process that I choose to use for\nme right now individually going through\nthe you know research plan implement\nphases which I do with specit but\nthere's openspec there's spec cli\nthere's like a 100 different\nimplementations of specdriven\ndevelopment under the sun so beats is\nperfect because it doesn't concern\nitself with however you get to those\ntasks right Okay, so let's just\nhypothetically imagine that\nthis is working. Stakeholders are\nagreeing,\nbeads are created, beads are executed on\nand then something is built, right?\nUm then what happens then? Is there some\nsort of accepting testing? Is there\nlike how do we get the stakeholder cuz\nlike this is another sort of\ncommunication issue whereby like you\nknow you and I we would we would plan\nsomething then we would create the beads\nand then we would you know BD ready get\nthe agent to to implement it but and\nthen we would have to like uh review the\ncode and check everything is looking\ngreat\n>> and then and then and then and then and\nthen test the product and then and then\ndeliver the product and then\n>> I think there you're you're you're first\nof forgetting some of the agile\nprinciples, right? Which is build a\nminimal first to get user feedback\nquickly. We all know that whatever the\nuser agrees to is not really what they\nwant until they see it.\n>> Oh, okay. So then we're going we're\ngoing back to an MVP.\n>> Yes. And and this is one of the\ntakeaways that like people say when they\nwork with AI is that you don't create\nmock-ups or you don't come with a design\nspecification with AI. You come with an\nMVP. You actually implement it and you\nlet people play with it.\n>> Um because it goes so fast. So So we\nneed when we do these planning poker,\nwe're talking about like small sprint\ntype of things and we need the\nacceptance criteria aside from all\nagreeing that this is what we want to\nbuild. We need to get an MVP. We and\nthis is the great thing about specit by\nthe way when when I do a feature\ndefinition it's always going to identify\nthe MVP of like what is the smallest\ntype of features that I need to to to\nthat I can show to someone for the\ninitial like UX feel of it um and I\nthink that's great uh in in these tools\num like\nlet's let's role play here so let's just\nsay like oh here's this MVP uh check it\nout on localhost\nuh 8,000.\nUm so they they check it out and then\nthen what happens then there's new\nrequirements like ah actually this\nshould say um you should say food\ninstead of bar and then and then it it\nat this point it engages Claude again\nbecause like especially I'm just\nthinking aloud for like UI based uh web\nbased things like Claude probably\ndoesn't even know what the render looks\nlike or something like that or you know\nlike I'm just I'm just thinking there's\ngoing to be there's going to be new\nchallenges here to engage with the argu\nI you mean this this is this is the this\nis a planning tool but like but we need\nanother tool to facilitate the\niterations once the MVP is built or\nwouldn't you or maybe I'm just\ncomplicating\n>> no I think that's where we need to just\nfall back to existing processes because\nyour session your cloud session of this\nplanning session is gone, right? That's\nthat's an ephemeral shortlived session.\nYou have some output artifacts that you\nyou either, you know, that you fed into\nbecause I think there's still a very\n>> So [clears throat] you I think I know\nwhat you're saying. You're going to you\njust start again. You you you throw away\nthe MVP\nand then you you start you start from\nscratch or something. Is that what\nyou're saying?\n>> It depends. Um it depends how what what\nwhat you want to do with the MVP. If you\nif you're an enterprise and you can\nspend $1,000 on on on on cloud tokens, I\nthink you can throw away and or generate\nfive different MVPs. Me personally, if\nif I spend a weekly budget of 20 dollars\na month on my on my MVP, I don't really\nwant to throw it away.\nOkay, so let's imagine now that we\nstarted from scratch, we used a whole\nbunch of tokens and now we have\nsomething that that the three\nstakeholders\nare happy with.\num isn't there going to be a question of\nmaintainability like\nor uh\n>> so this is where I feel the the idea of\nmaintainability of software is going to\nchange significantly because and I think\nbe uh Steve also says this very nicely\nwhen he talks about beats he says I\ncreated in October so what three months\nand it has thousands of users right now\nI have never looked at the code I've not\nlooked at the code and if you look at\nbut I think he's exaggerating\nAnd if you look at Gast Town, he says he\ngives like a bunch of caveats. It's\ngoing to cost you a lot of money. It's\ngoing to cost you an arm and a leg. It's\ngoing to be insane if you're not at\nstage seven of AI adoption. He he makes\na diagram of like um you know people\nthat um that use AI.\n>> Is that in his in his blog? I didn't\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Very nice diagram of like\nthe level of AI adoption. And then he he\nasks are you at the stage where you\nlearn run at least five different\nheadless cloud sessions? If you're not,\nthen this is not for you. Yeah, [snorts]\nthat one. So, figure one is\num\nzero or near zero. So, you don't use\nfigure two is AI is doing proposals. You\nsay yes, no, and you adopt Exactly.\n>> Okay, we've been talking about this,\n>> right? Figure three is you go yolo mode\nwith the agent completely managing your\ncode and you are still looking at the\ncode. Figure four I forgot what's the\nfigure the difference between three and\nfour but clearly the code is less\nimportant. Figure five is you're fully\nin the terminal with one cloud session.\nFigure six is you are in the ter like\nmultiple cloud sessions and figure seven\nis like guest town is if you're at\nfigure seven or eight you have like a a\nsignificant amount of parallel cloud\nsessions running. He explains them in in\nuh in the blog uh below. I\n>> I uh I haven't got through the blog, but\nyeah. So, this makes me think we've been\ntalking about this at length and but\nlike at at this point we're only on\nstage two and it feels like we're a\nlittle bit behind\n>> each and everyone individual right I'm\nI'm pretty much as figure five. I'm\nhaving I'm usually running a single\ncloud session and I don't look at the\ncode. This is why and you say it's going\nto create a problem with code\nmaintainability. I believe that docs\nfirst\num integration test or end to end\nplayright is your validation of the\ndocs. So these are always a sync. If\nthey're not then you have a problem and\nthen your code. You may want to run some\nsecurity of defec ops agents to identify\nvulnerabilities and things like that and\nsome well architecture reviews of your\ncode but personally you will not like\nyou know you only look at it at a high\nlevel architecture and you put your\nobservability around it. You look at\nyour memory usage and you basically\nidentify bottlenecks and you only\nrefactor when needed like no pre\npremature optimization. Anytime you look\nat the code it's premature optimization\nlike you should just you know trust the\nprocess.\nI think so. And and you you trust that\nyour docs and integration tests catch\nany regressions. So you can say, \"Hey, I\nwant to change this whole feature and\nthen uh or I add a new feature.\" And\nthen you can just run the thing and it\ngoes like, \"Yep, all of the existing\nuser stories still work. You're good to\ngo.\" And we have a new one and it's\nfully covered by integration tests.\n>> Wow, man. This the future that we're\nheading in is really crazy. But like\ntake beads for example. Say\nSay Steve decided like I'm not looking\nat the code and I wanted to reimplement\nagain. Um I'm assuming beat has some\nsort of test harness or something like\nthat. And that's where that's where it's\nsuper important like what the whole\nthing I said, right? You need to have at\nleast\na um you know a quick feedback loop for\nyour AI when it makes a change to know\nthat like oops I broke you know all of\nthis other stuff that's suddenly block\nthe integration tests are not working.\nBut I'm happy to say that I don't see\ncloud going and saying oop this test\nisn't doesn't\n>> I'm happy to say that cloud doesn't go\nlike oh this is a pre-existing issue let\nme disable the test which it used to do\nlike a month ago.\n>> Well this doesn't in my experience it\nwill just change the test.\n>> No no it doesn't. So that's where I I do\nlook at the diff on my test\n>> because that's a trouble with tests like\nthe tests can encode a lot of\nassumptions and things like that.\n>> Yeah. So I just I just did the whole\nthing um which is like a dock platform\nwith LLM prompt for cloud ask user tool.\nSo that's the thing I built is is\nbasically tracking content going into an\ncloud session with user tool to make\nchanges to and then check it back in. So\nyou have the the that's what I built and\nI just realized that it assumes the\nserver processes access to the files on\nlocal disk and I'm like hold on a minute\nthe do platform doesn't run on the CLI\nyou know the client side so it doesn't\nhave access to the disk so so the whole\ndesign I totally missed um the fact that\nthe client needs to send the content to\nthe doc platform for to make changes and\nso all of my integration tests are\npassing because it is running within the\nsame workspace. So when the server gets\na request, it just reads the file from\nthe workspace instead of it running in a\nseparate one. So right now I'm doing a\nmassive refactor saying like okay create\na whole new set of integration tests\nwhere the server process runs in a\ndifferent folder and to make sure\nthere's no case where um you know so\nthere's no way that that that the server\ncan you know modify a file locally\nthinking that the client changes have\nnot been persisted. So, so yes, the you\nneed to look at those integration tests.\nYou need to you need to look at the\ndocumentation and you need to look at\nthe integration test and I also ask\n>> code the tests are part of the code,\nright? I'm just I'm just thinking aloud\nhere. Yeah, there's there's no way of\ngetting around. Yeah. So that's another\ncomment I got is um some systems are so\ncomplex multi microser and all that and\nso this is very hard of a of a workflow\nto implement over these complex systems\nif you don't if you cannot spin up a\nwhole integration testing environment.\nTo me the integration testing is the\nonly place you or like even the\nendto-end testing is the only place you\ncan actually do um validate that that\nthings work and then you\nexisting systems are not built for this\nright existing systems heavily rely on\nmanual verification of QA um and and are\nway too complex to to build a whole\nintegration testing environment but if\nyou're building something new\n>> I just thinking allow just to put just\nto put the tests in the code is kind of\ndangerous um they kind of need to be\nseparated just for safety almost.\n>> No, I don't think so. I prefer what I\nlike right now I I I've done four or\nfive projects where I use specit\ndevelopment specit driven development\nand beats and I go for a full monor repo\neverything like side by side and it's\nperfect because cloud can go yeah\n>> and directly see hey my API is here my\nprotocol definitions are here my\nintegration testing are there and and I\nneed to go full stack like I need to go\nand change my my my um my protoraph\n>> okay so say we have some in end to- end\ntests. I mean, normally in the modern\nworld, this would look like some,\nyou know, most most uh pieces of\nsoftware end up being a web page or or\nan iOS app or something.\n>> Mhm.\n>> And and let's be honest, doing end\nto-end tests on the web is still or or\nor on mobile still a pain in the ass.\nIt's going to be quite manual, isn't it?\nNo, I I mean for the web app that I\nbuilt, I use Playright. I never used\nPlayright in my life, but cloud code\nwrote the scripts and I I manually\nverify it and I know it works. If it\ndoesn't, I say, \"Hey, the playright is\nnot covering this.\" And it goes and and\nfixes it. It says now the play is\nfailing.\n>> My like it works in trivial cases, but\nin like big enterprise, if you ran\nplayright over in an Atlassian estate,\nit would consume a billion tokens and\nexplode and\n>> No, no, no. Not playright MCP. Okay.\nAbsolutely not Playright MCP. Playright\nthe actual test harness.\nThis is what I hate about the Playright\nMCP is like this. They seem to assume\nthat you want the LLM to drive it and\nspend a billion tokens to go through the\nprocess.\n>> Okay. You need to show me your usage of\nplayright. But I still I'm still\n>> playright. If this is what we're going\nto rely on to make sure that we're\ndelivering something that works, I'm a\nbit nervous about this.\n>> And that's that's reality today that so\nmany organizations don't have a proper\nfirst off database seeding mechanism or\nability to even create a full\nintegration environment for integration\ntesting and then they don't have fully\nautomated end to like end toend testing\nscripts. But if you write playright end\nto end testing scripts, it actually\ndoesn't need an LLM to drive. Now go\nclick on this button. Let me take a\nscreenshot. Oh no, no, no, wait for this\nbutton to appear. And then the LLM is\ndoing that. That's insane. That's\nstupid. Playright has a scripting\nengine. You can say in this particular\ntest case, we're going to, you know,\nwe're going to click on the login\nbutton. It's going to redirect us to\nKeycloak for enterprise login. So we\nwait for the key logo to to appear, the\nlogin to appear. uh we then log in with\nour click click credentials for our\nintegration testing environment which is\nbootstrapped by the way during the setup\nphase. So I have a unique set of\ncredentials to use during my end to end\nintegration testing.\n>> Doing credentials flow is going to be a\ntotal pain.\n>> Yeah. But that's why you need to build\nthese systems with automation in mind.\nSo so that that's real. It's true. I I\njoin many companies and they're like oh\nwe don't know how to do our things and\nwe want to have an integration testing\nenvironment. And I'm like great. Yeah, I\ncan I can do that. And then like okay,\nhow do you bootstrap user accounts? How\ndo you set up this and that? And nothing\ncan be automated. Well, maybe I'm\ntalkingual failed career, but like I\nhave implemented a few integration tests\nin my life, but they just tend to be so\nexpensive and hard to maintain and you\nyou make one or two\n>> and then you know how it works, but then\nyou know you move on to another team or\nyou\n>> But the great thing about LLMs is that\nthey like I never wrote a playright\nscript in my life, but the agent knows\nand then it just works and then it\nactually runs and when you go into the\nplayright studio, whatever the thing is\ncalled that shows up the UI when you\nwhen you run it in UI mode. It actually\nyou can see every single step like you\nsee the screen.\n>> Okay, you need to show this to me. But\nanyway, I think I think we're\n>> but the thing is that you get a full LLM\ncontext. Now this playright UI has a\nrightclick button, copy error, copy\nprompt, and you can prompt it. It says\nwe're in the playright test suite. This\nis the step we're at. This is the error\nthat the browser console is showing.\nThis is what we saw in the previous step\nand you don't need an LLM to drive.\n>> Okay. In the next video, you need to\nshow me playright working as you've just\ndescribed.\n>> You don't believe me?\n>> I don't believe you. But but I want to\nbelieve to be honest. Okay, let's let's\nwind up.\n>> I know that your comment is going to be\nit's a trivial system that you're doing\nthis on. I showed it to you before. I\nthink I showed you the grit uh you login\nflow.\n>> Okay, so next is a focus on this. Let me\nsee if I can highlight it. Okay, cool. I\nneed to get on with my day. I'm sure you\ndo, too.\n>> You don't believe me. I'm tell I'm I'm\ntelling you I agree with you that today\nthe systems that the way that they're\nwritten and the way that humans have to\nmaintain these things, they tend to run\nout of sync. But I feel I have a very\nstrong feeling that with the LLM and the\ncapabilities of the LLM, the LLM takes\non ownership on a lot of these\ncomponents and the users are just there\nto validate. And it's pretty much what\nGasttown is saying as well. The human\nrole is reduced to an overseer. We just\nvalidate the process.\n>> The validate like we I thought we were\njust discussing that the validation can\nbe automated and enter.\n>> No, the human validates the validation.\n>> All right. I um anyway I wanted to talk\nto anyone who's listening to please uh\nrate the podcast\ncomment in the YouTube email\nhow do people reach you Vincent\n>> uh reach me\n>> don't say LinkedIn\n>> I I watch the comments sometimes so if\nthere's a comment I will I will respond\n>> wow man\n>> I don't know you're a man of the people.\n[laughter] I I will sometimes look at\nwhat you have to say, but otherwise I\ndon't care.\n>> No, no, I do. I do. I go care. How do\nthey reach me? You're like, \"What?\"\n>> Do you have any like You can email me at\nhenry.fe, for example, and tell me that\nI'm wrong or you have a better idea.\n>> Okay. Uh, you can\nGod, this is so hard with you, Vincent.\nHonestly,\n>> can't really reach me. No.\n>> [laughter]\n>> Okay. Well,\n>> you can even and Kai and then Kai can\ntell me if somebody says that I was\ntotally wrong that play right doesn't\nwork the way I say it does.\n>> Cool, man. Anyway, it's uh Oh, we didn't\nYeah. Okay. We couldn't cover\neverything. This is crazy. Loving it.\nOkay. See you guys. Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:54]\nMerry Christmas. >> Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. >> Happy New Year. >> So, the over the Well, okay. I got I got Claude installed here. The The two things that I worked on was I might have worked on this >> in the top one. It was the Pi. >> Yeah. But there's also this um I think I mentioned this to you before. I don't I sort of vibe coded this not even with beads I think with Gemini and and conductor. >> Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you tried out conductor. >> I'm very excited to hear what >> I don't know. I think I thought it did a really good job like all the stuff here. Um >> have you gone through the whole specket as well just as an >> or have you only tried? I think I've tried it, but like I I felt I felt the conductor experience was a little bit more streamlined. Yeah. >> To be honest, I don't know exactly what these archives. I think tracks are I think you mentioned it before. >> It's it's the it's like the specs basically. >> Yeah. So, I think I think if you looked in here, you can do some archeology archology. Archology and you can work out what I did. But I thought it was quite a smooth process. M >> of course the I mean is what this thing is is just a a very simple uh uh Chrome extension. It did seem like but I guess this is maybe normal. You know it did seem like we're generating 50 files to do like one tiny little piece of JavaScript. Um but you know I guess that's just normal. I mean the I mean what and God knows how many tokens. It's like it's basically 100 lines of code for basically a lot of a lot of uh bureaucracy in some ways. Do you >> have Yeah, these systems like conductor >> it's saving my screenshots. Ah, that's really cool cuz I was going like ah this is not working. >> Oh, it has a Oh, wow. It stores. Okay, so cloud code does the same thing but it shows it stores your images in your home directory. H so I don't know if it ever yeah see so the end result here it says age four months ago but the problem is that is that Amazon is like sometimes having this information sometimes isn't but there is a I did figure out there's a shorefire way of figuring out the the age and that's to load that that AI Roffus >> and then you ask the AI Roffus what how old is the product and it will tell you so It's almost like the whole extension doesn't need to exist. You could >> cuz you see it right there at the top of the bar. >> You could just uh talk to Rufus, but unfortunately that's not programmatic. >> Oh, so wait, Rufus is an Amazon thing.…\n\n[slide:2] [5:34–17:22]\nnetwork should work were not really working very well because I had a I had a screw up in my ubiquity thing and and it was just crazy. So that's kind of dumb. But I I wanted to show you that my home setup. I think you might be marginally impressed by this. Uh let me just stop sharing. I'm so good at this. Here we go. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> I need I need to install Ghosty on my Mac. I use it on my Arch, by the way, but I don't use it on my Mac. >> Okay. So, this is where you might be impressed. Have you ever played with uh machinectl or systemd uh endspawn? >> Endspawn. All right. Um only through rocket from core o. So that's a very long time. >> I mean I could I could get these I could get it running a little bit quicker than I am doing now. But like for example I have an IP range pointing to my Pi. So this is why the networking is a bit confusing. >> So you make like a flat network. you you give them you allocate the range to the pi so that the containers >> so basically basically I can I can make this a little bit faster but I'm just debooting debootstrapping from absolute scratch as you can see but in the matter of a few seconds I can I can basically boot up a VPS on uh a on a static IP is that the right expression on on a standalone IP. So basically this VPS um completely owns that IP. And I've got a I've got 64 of those IPs. Well, actually, I think 62 are usable, but whatever. >> You get the point. >> So, basically, I have I I one thing that I was doing with this Raspberry Pi over the weekend was essentially set up uh a way of spinning up VPS's just quickly. So, I don't have to use Digital Ocean. I can just use my Pi to >> well to >> How much CPU and memory does a Pi have that P? >> Not not a lot, but it seems fast enough for what I do. I think it's like 4 GB or something. [laughter] >> Okay. >> Something tiny. >> But this VM is like um it's like what is it? KVM or or >> it's it's using systemd nspawn which is some sort of systemd thing. >> Still containers. Yeah. >> Yeah. So, um I don't know there's nothing nothing much running inside except SSHD the the setup script as you can see here like um I I I download the keys from GitHub you know cuz I don't know if you know this trick this GitHub >> yeah I do this >> keys I just I just set up SSH >> I throw in my my keys into the authorized keys >> set up my user disable password authentication and all that sort of stuff And then I'm in I'm in there. Um, and then of course what the next thing I was going to…\n\n[slide:3] [17:02–28:53]\n>> [snorts] >> So, did you ever have chance to play with the Gas Town? >> Not much. No, I've still I'm still reading it. You know how I guess the the real thing is you have to to try it out. But, um, Steve says that many warnings, be careful. This is expensive. He runs three cloud three Anttopic Pro subscriptions to run Gast Town. Each one I assume are around $200. So it's like $600 a month to to run Gast Town. >> It's it's crazy. But but back to the the thing, right, with with basically we have a cloud skill that that's there. Um we tell Beats um we give it information about how to create beats issues and yet it still somehow sometimes thinks that when it needs to add a comment instead of doing BD comment add it runs BD comment add without the s and then there's an alias beats have both it has beat beats comments add or an alias for comments ad is BD comment, but there's no BD comment ad. And and and actually it's funny because Steve says that um you know this um picture of when you look at the park in a city and the the city planning decides that there should be roads here and here, but then actually when people walk to work and to school and everywhere, they like walk across the park. >> We call them car paths. Yeah. >> Yeah. So basic basically it's a very um interesting design, right? where that's >> and he he says you should treat the LLM hallucinations as such. So if it delucinates something, you should implement it. So next time, you know, it has all the options. [laughter] >> It's crazy. >> It one thing I find remarkable about using AI is that it it does like behave like a human. Like it does it trips up in the same way. Absolutely. It's it's crazy. It's just like >> so people who've designed some software, other humans must have tripped up at the same point. So I find it like an amazing way of now validating some a design because if AI can't figure it out, the humans are not going to figure it out, right? >> Yeah. Absolutely. Uh and I thought so I'm doing this in a context where I already did a significant amount of of like research and refactoring because I already explained some information about how to create and use beats. Um reexplained it and redirected it. I thought, you know what, I don't want to kill the the session. I want to keep this one. and I still had like 45% context uh left. So I thought it's going to be fine. But maybe that's why it started to hallucinates these things. But it's exactly the same as me, right? I can't remember.…\n\n[slide:4] [28:33–40:22]\nthinking is that the GitHub repo is is the source of truth and then we then we go from there to >> to to Confluence so that other people can read the docs. >> But then how does it get to Microsoft Word? Um, yeah. This is where things get a little bit weird, don't they? >> You still I mean, I thought you were talking about the 70s when you No, sorry. About the the the the '9s when you mentioned Microsoft Word. What are you talking about? Who is using Microsoft Word? I thought everyone already >> enterprises are enterprises are like there's people who, you know, don't code and >> yeah, I mean like how do you get >> I don't understand what you're saying. [laughter] But this is this is the problem I have. How do how do we get uh to this flow essentially? >> Yeah. So so I make a joke about this, but this was exactly the problem I had with my previous company cuz I kept saying Markdown is a source of truth and he was saying we have other people that don't code. I guess I just don't get that. Um and that that don't you know access um markdown. He says like there's a a design step before you go to the repo. >> Something that is >> across multiple repos that's so the design step is is now with AI essentially talking to the AI and and and the artifact is markdown or some or plain text and that's that's what we're familiar with. I think those people that are still using Microsoft Word are also those people that are still uh going into a chat GPT session and then ask to and then manually copy paste out the code that it proposes. [laughter] >> Yeah. >> Or like or like do a bunch of deep research. I mean I I'm jo I shouldn't be too >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I did that >> the people in this in this Microsoft Word domain are are using JBT in their web browser for sure. >> Exactly. Right. >> Um Yeah. like how how to in how to include people here in the in the AI iterative iterative process >> iteratorative iterative yeah this this is this is my thought here so I send you a link in the chat um because for me I I think we I just I think spec driven design and you just turned this upside down right but I can imagine to introduce that to enterprises is very hard. Uh but this guy's um appar this is this post looks like my workflow blah blah blah but actually he's he's one of the like it's a promotion for a platform called core. So at the bottom you see yes I work for core which is like red planet HQ core. Um but core is seem to be like a drop in to integrate multiple…\n\n[slide:5] [40:01–51:47]\nYeah, just just reaching alignment is going to be so challenging here. >> There was a human caterpillar. Oh, what? The human uh for a while. [laughter] Never mind. >> This is going to be nuts. This is going to be nuts. >> Yeah. So, um I'm actually been like opening threads like crazy to see how people and I think one of the interesting organizations working on this is human layers. They did a a presentation where they heavily referenced Steve Jagis beats project as well and talking about um you know at what at what stage you have um brain rot how do they call it? So, so because of the I think they they say at the 30% 40% mark, if you only have 40% left of uh unused context, that's where you are in the non-productive zone of your context window. And so he he highlights it's called um the the talk is called harness engineering and we can link it um later but he talks about how to control that context and common mistakes and um this relates to this I'm I'm sure because it talks about how you get the context um and how you you know how you optimize your workflow. Basically, human layers does a lot of effort there. At the end of of of his talk, he talks about if you like what what I've talked about, go check out human layers. Um, in terms of like how do we, you know, interact and integrate this um this LM >> human layers is some software then like so I just I'm startup. >> Well, I really like that thing that we were talking about over over WhatsApp. I mean everyone's going crazy about that that that sort of uh I keep on it's got such an in memorable name that that tool that which basically prompts you what is the name of it again? >> Ask user tool. >> Yeah, ask ask user tool. How about this? I'm just riffing here. But say you're working with AI, the ask user tool sends a message to to each of the sort of stakeholders, the middle managers or something like that and and ask them to agree on this certain thing and then all they need to press is like enter and then they move on to the next thing and then enter move on to next thing and if if they don't so basically it's like some sort of democracy because you know stakeholder A and B might answer something option one but stakeholder uh uh C might option might say option two or something. So we need some sort of like democracy type or you know or get get into some uh ubi no ubiquitous what do you call it when unanimous decision about a certainity thing. >> Not unanimous I think it's majority. >> Well yeah that's…\n\n[slide:6] [51:27–58:01]\nand then something is built, right? Um then what happens then? Is there some sort of accepting testing? Is there like how do we get the stakeholder cuz like this is another sort of communication issue whereby like you know you and I we would we would plan something then we would create the beads and then we would you know BD ready get the agent to to implement it but and then we would have to like uh review the code and check everything is looking great >> and then and then and then and then and then test the product and then and then deliver the product and then >> I think there you're you're you're first of forgetting some of the agile principles, right? Which is build a minimal first to get user feedback quickly. We all know that whatever the user agrees to is not really what they want until they see it. >> Oh, okay. So then we're going we're going back to an MVP. >> Yes. And and this is one of the takeaways that like people say when they work with AI is that you don't create mock-ups or you don't come with a design specification with AI. You come with an MVP. You actually implement it and you let people play with it. >> Um because it goes so fast. So So we need when we do these planning poker, we're talking about like small sprint type of things and we need the acceptance criteria aside from all agreeing that this is what we want to build. We need to get an MVP. We and this is the great thing about specit by the way when when I do a feature definition it's always going to identify the MVP of like what is the smallest type of features that I need to to to that I can show to someone for the initial like UX feel of it um and I think that's great uh in in these tools um like let's let's role play here so let's just say like oh here's this MVP uh check it out on localhost uh 8,000. Um so they they check it out and then then what happens then there's new requirements like ah actually this should say um you should say food instead of bar and then and then it it at this point it engages Claude again because like especially I'm just thinking aloud for like UI based uh web based things like Claude probably doesn't even know what the render looks like or something like that or you know like I'm just I'm just thinking there's going to be there's going to be new challenges here to engage with the argu I you mean this this is this is the this is a planning tool but…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "A long, informal conversation between two engineers about experiments with AI-driven development and lightweight infra. They demo a small Chrome extension and cloud coding workflows, describe a Raspberry Pi used to spin up many tiny VPSes with public IPs, and debate reproducibility, testing and how to fold AI into spec-driven development for teams. Key concrete details: the Pi hosts a subnet of about 64 public IPs (roughly 62 usable), the Pi has ~4 GB of RAM, a guest tool called Gastown can cost ~three subscriptions at about $200 each (~$600/month), and the speakers repeatedly stress the need for integration tests and docs-first validation. Two lines stand out as representative: *\"Build reliable infrastructure with confidence.\"* and *\"you don't create mock-ups or you don't come with a design specification with AI. You come with an MVP.\"*\n[slide:1]\n## Chrome extension and local AI tooling\nThey built a tiny Chrome extension to scrape Amazon details and experimented with multiple LLM front-ends (Claude, Gemini, Conductor) and \"cloud code\" sessions. The extension turned into more generated files than expected — roughly dozens of supporting files for a small JS feature — and the speakers note that AI scaffolding can feel bureaucratic compared with the 100 lines of core code. The session stores screenshots and artifacts (cloud code keeps images in the home directory), and they discovered a non-programmatic shortcut: Amazon's on-page AI assistant (\"Rufus\") can answer product-age questions directly, which reduces the need for the extension for that single task. The speakers also show how AI assistants can hallucinate small CLI aliases (typos like \"BD comment ad\" vs \"BD comment add\") and stress that hallucinations are useful design signals when handled cautiously.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Raspberry Pi as a tiny VPS host\nOne participant uses a Raspberry Pi to bootstrap many isolated VPS-like containers using systemd-nspawn (a systemd container primitive). He maps an entire public subnet to the Pi so each nspawn instance can \"own\" its public IP; he reports having 64 total IPs from his ISP (about 62 usable). The Pi is modest (about 4 GB of RAM) but considered \"fast enough\" for many small experiments; each container usually runs very little (an SSHD and a setup script). The setup flow pulls SSH keys from GitHub to populate authorized_keys, disables password auth, and then the container can run Docker or other services. They discuss socket-activation and service activation patterns (systemd features) so containers can be dormant until traffic arrives, and compare this lightweight approach to serverless and Firecracker-style micro-VM isolation while flagging that container isolation still has security tradeoffs.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Agents, beats, hallucinations and Gastown costs\nThey discuss \"beats\" (an agent/task markup workflow) and its integration with cloud sessions; agents sometimes mis-invoke commands due to minor token or alias mismatches, which exposes brittle UX edges in agent tooling. The guest project Gastown is invoked as an example of a powerful but costly platform: the speaker cites running three cloud subscriptions around $200 each, implying roughly $600/month in baseline cost for his Gastown setup. They emphasize that LLMs often fail in human-like ways and that hallucinations should be treated as test cases or cues to improve the spec/UX. The conversation also touches on the idea that when an agent fails repeatedly at a decision point, that signals a design ambiguity that humans likely share.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Docs-first, Markdown, and enterprise friction\nA recurring theme: treat the Git repository as the source of truth and start with text/Markdown specs so AI can consume and iterate them. They contrast this with enterprises that still rely on multiple doc silos (Confluence, Google Docs, Word, Notion), which complicates an AI-in-the-loop workflow. The speakers argue for a flow where design artifacts (mockups, specs) are plain text that feed LLM-driven generation, then integrate back into repo docs and tests. They acknowledge cultural hurdles: many stakeholders don't use Markdown or repositories, so adoption requires bridging tools and automation that sync repo docs into enterprise doc platforms and keep stakeholders in the loop without forcing them into developer tools.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Coordination: \"ask user\" tool, planning and context limits\nThey sketch an \"ask user\" or \"ask group\" pattern: an automated prompt flow that polls stakeholders with simple choices to speed alignment, akin to planning-poker or majority polling for decisions. Open-source tooling (OpenCode and terminal-sharing tools like Warp) are discussed as integration points; OpenCode maintainers are adding plugin hooks so interactive flows like ask-user can run across different front ends rather than being terminal-only. The speakers reference Human Layers and the \"harness engineering\" talk about context window management and the productivity cliff: when only ~30–40% of the context window remains free, work becomes non-productive. They emphasize lightweight voting and alignment UX (unanimous vs majority), and the practical need for a loop that surfaces AI output to stakeholders quickly.\n\n[slide:6]\n## MVP-first development, tests and maintainability\nTheir recommended workflow: identify a minimal viable product (MVP) from the spec, let agents implement it, then validate via integration/end-to-end tests. Playwright (test harness) and integration tests are critical validation artifacts that must run reliably and be separated from a single ephemeral workspace; one speaker caught a design bug where server-side code read files from the same workspace rather than from a separate server workspace, so they refactored tests to ensure server and client run in isolated folders. They argue that good docs + integration tests are the guardrails that make agent-driven changes safe: if integration tests fail, you know the docs/tests disagree with the implementation. They accept that full enterprise systems remain hard to spin up for tests, so automation and environment bootstrapping are prerequisites for safe AI-driven workflows."
