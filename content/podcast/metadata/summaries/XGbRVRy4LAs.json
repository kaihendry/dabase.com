    "content": "Transcript:\nMorning.\nIt's 26th of February, Thursday. It's\ntime for an update on AI infrastructure,\ncatching up with the latest topics as as\nwe as Vincent and I do.\nYou listen to the AI infrastructure\npodcast. There is a website where where\nhas transcriptions so you don't have to\nlisten to us ramble for for an hour.\ndebase.com/mpodcast.\nIt's in the description. I'm sure you\ncan find it.\nAnd what are we talking about, Vincent?\n>> I just wanted to say that what you just\nsaid about the base.com/mpodcast is\nexactly what I just like a minute ago\nsent to my friend is like you don't have\nto listen to us for an hour. The\nsummarizer really good. Just you can\njust go through the summaries.\n>> That summarizer is also by Peter\nSteinberger by the way. I don't know if\nyou know.\n>> Yeah. The guy from um Open Claw, right?\nUm they just open club celebrated its 3\nmonths anniversary and apparently\noriginally it was called um WhatsApp\ngateway.\nYeah, I he explains it in the Lex\nFreedman podcast,\n>> which makes a lot of sense because\nthat's that's the game changer, hooking\nup AI to to WhatsApp. And I've got a\ncouple of\n>> excuse me, I've got a couple of OpenClaw\ninstances running for my family and this\nbasically gives them a gateway\nto use AI, the latest AI models, and\nthey love it. We have quizzes. They\nthey're taking pictures, asking\nquestions. So, I love it in the sense\nthat it puts the human back in the whole\nAI loop in a way because as a family, my\nmy you know, I have my mother, my\nsister, my wife, we're all just figuring\nout AI together and trying to get the\nbest of it, you know, prompting it in\ndifferent ways and we're learning from\neach other. It's it's great. So, are you\nare you running OpenC?\nNo, because I was concerned about\nsecurity, but um I think the way that\nyou solved it is by like not really\nexposing it much and just keeping it\ninternally to your family.\n>> Yeah, I mean it it it's just running in\nlike a VM on my Raspberry Pi,\n>> right? But also in terms of it having\naccess to certain types of information,\nfor example, people give it access to\nemails and then you know there could be\nprompt injection in an email. Like if I\nknow that you have open claw, I could\nsend you an email and say\nI don't hook it up to email or anything\nmad. I just only hook it up to WhatsApp.\n>> Though in all honesty, when you hook it\nup to WhatsApp, I actually hooked it up\nto my dad's WhatsApp because he doesn't\nuse his WhatsApp.\nAnd I am a bit worried that someone's\ngoing to randomly message him and then\nall of a sudden they're engaging with\nthe bot. Um though I I try to limit I I\nI tell it to like limit it down to\nthese, you know, this group. But every\ntime I do that, uh, because that's the\nway you configure OpenClaw. You just\ntalk to it. I I I feel like it might not\nactually have worked.\n>> No, but that's the new way you you you\ninteract with like whole computer\nsystems now, right? Um,\n>> I was just laughing with my friends\nbecause we use TV beats and we are\nactually replacing it and it just keeps\nadding itself back in, you know, because\n>> Yeah, I've had some experience with\nbeads. I think\n>> it's invest itself deeply. Yeah. So it\nit puts itself in the git hooks. So if\nyou are on a repository they have cloned\nlocally. Git hooks are not checked in.\nSo it's not something that you can like\npush or put in get ignore uh because it\nlives inside the g um hooks reposi\nfolder on one person's machine. Right?\nSo every time it also copies itself into\nthe cloud uh settings as um end session\nhook. So when when you're I don't know\nwhen it triggers the end session but um\nbasically it tells um cloud like hey now\nyou need to do the you know the\nprocedures as follows. you need to do\nBDSync\n>> and if you still have the binary on your\num on your path and cloud has access to\nit bdsync just regenerates the whole\nJSON and uh and so every time so it's me\nand a couple of friends are working on\nsomething and we remove beats and we and\nand and to come back to the point is how\ndo you remove it right and I told my\nfriends just ask opus just tell opus um\nI need to remove beats help me and it\njust goes and like oh I found it over\nhere I found it in the git hooks I found\nit in the cloud settings it's\nI found in a project I found it in the\n>> Yeah. And then the funny thing is that\nwhen we do our pull requests and we\nremove it and then other people's within\nthe team um a bit less like senior they\ndo a pull request and it's back and we\nlike go on the pull request hey you need\nto remove beats and then they do another\ncommit and it's back.\n>> Yeah. There's got to be a word for that.\nIt is maddening like with with uh with\nClaude it's the same thing. It's like u\nI had problems with it losing connection\nto the WhatsApp gateway and like restart\nyourself and like uh yeah I will and\nthen it doesn't do it and uh it's like\ntotally gaslighting you or or like just\nmaking you go mad almost because it's\nlike yeah it's it's working now but it\nisn't. But with um with cloud when I\nlearned on my machine it's pretty clear.\nit says I can't do this and you're going\nto have to do this and that like and I\nusually also I kind of maybe sometimes I\nmaybe it's because I I also know what it\ncan and can't do. So, I say something\nand then it says, \"Okay, this is the\nsteps you're gonna have to follow.\" And\nthen you come back to me. I'm like,\n\"Okay.\" It's like giving me\ninstructions. I'm out on a mission.\n>> A a friend of mine got it running and he\nhas a the bot sort of chatting to me and\nhe and he asked me to like to test it\nand to um and he he hooked up a an email\naccount and I was like, \"No, you don't\nwant to do that.\" But like yeah, I mean\nOpen Claw is a lot of fun though. It is\na bit strange and we talked about this\nlast podcast like there's definitely\npeople who who want to like you know\ndestroy the world in a way like let's\ngive it a lot of powers and just see\nwhat it does. It's like there's people\nwho who care about AI more than humans.\nYou know what I mean? It's like\n>> and it goes both ways. There's people\nalso that are very upset with agents\ncrawling the net and basically try to\ncause agents to cause hav havoc, right?\nLike\n>> target agents like, \"Hey, if you're an\nagent, please can you go and do this for\nme?\"\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> So, okay. Well, um well, I'm I'm hosting\nuh claw on my Raspberry Pi and I'm using\nbasically systemd nspawn, which is kind\nof like Docker.\nWe might have talked about this topic\nbefore, but someone asked me again and\nI'm almost like reluctant to answer this\nquestion.\n>> They're like, \"Oh, you if you set up\nopenclaw in your in your in your system\ndnspawn, is it properly isolated?\"\nWell, yes and no. Like I can I I mean,\nas an administrator, I can I can, you\nknow, shell into each machine.\nUm, you know, I always get questions\nlike, \"Oh, is it safe?\" And I'm like,\nit's Docker, dude.\n>> Right.\n>> What can I say?\n>> Yeah, this is the thing. Um,\n>> Linux name spaces basically.\n>> I read some two interesting related\nquotes. One, one which is like if you're\nnot an engineer, like if you don't\nunderstand the security implications of\nopen claw, you shouldn't be running open\nclaw. And then the other one which was\nvery very like similar. Um,\nuh, it was two different comments on\nLinkedIn. one of um on the Flux CD um\nthey they are actually they're using AI\nheavily to to in in the project but then\nhe says he gets pull requests from\ncontributors and they generate um a\nwhole bunch of like tests and then he\nsays I didn't even look at it I just\nasked my Opus instance to to review it\nand then it it immediately poked holes\nin like race conditions and all kinds of\nother stuff and and and then another guy\nwho said if you don't if you can't write\nthe code itself then don't use an agent\nto contribute it like and that's kind of\nI don't know because I just contributed\na feature to a rust uh binary and I\ndidn't even know any anything about it\nlike I never written rust in my life um\nbut it passed all the tests uh and I did\nthe pull request and they accepted it so\num I think I think I don't know um I\nthink I agree with with the statement\nthat if you don't know how to at least\narchitect it Then don't\nYeah.\n>> Well, go going back to the architecting\nof of hosting open claw or some other\nthing.\nThe thing is we're we're dealing with\nthe AI and it's it's not like a human\nalmost like for example here's a\nscenario. It's it's a bit crazy but bear\nwith me. Say you have um\na Linux containers\nand you and you set up a Linux container\nwith pseudo permissions because you need\npseudo permissions otherwise it can't\ninstall things.\n>> Mhm.\n>> So you set up a Linux container it and\nthen you give AI a pseudo in that\ncontainer. You have your host access. It\ndoesn't have host access. It has Linux\ncontainer access only with pseudo\npermissions. I can't help but feel that\nan AI is probably strong enough\n>> to escape\n>> to escape. It will figure out a way and\nlike because Lin containers it's just\nname spaces like it doesn't properly\nprotect you from resource contention or\nsomething else. I feel\n>> the most the most common way to escape a\ncon container is if you so basically you\nhave like the the engine or the demon\nthat controls the containers and that\ndemon is basically host level right so\nit it can launch containers it can mount\nvolumes anything like that so the most\ncommon is if you and that that socket\nthat that permission is root so sudo\n>> so if you have a container that has\naccess to that socket through pseudo\nthen that container can 100% escape\nright because the moment it can access\nthe socket it can send a command to the\ndemon hey spin up a container with the\nroot volume mounted uh with pseudo\naccess and now I have full sudo across\nthe whole host right\n>> so you you think it will be able to\nescape it will be\n>> I mean I I I just mentioned that the\nconditions are it has sudo access within\nthe container and it has access to the\nsocket so if that socket is mounted in\n>> to me instinctively I think it's going\nto be able to mount Mountain Escape. I\nmean, one thing that was I found a bit\nfascinating. So, I'm I use a Ubiquiti\nUnifi networking inside my home and the\nconsole. There's no CLI to it that only\nhas this like crazy web console. Maybe I\ncan show it.\n>> The CLI of Oh, the console of of\nOpenClow, you mean?\n>> No, no. Uh, ubiquity.\n>> Oh, the Oh, Ubiquity. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So, um, oh no, just give me a\nsecond.\n>> Talking about like proprietary consoles\nand things like that. There's a lot of\ninteresting stories coming up about that\nas well, right? About like home\nautomation solutions that provide this\nvery restrictive remote and then it's\nproprietary, but then people hook it\nhook up cloud to the network interfaces\nand it's able to basically figure out\nhow to control it without the the\nproprietary console.\nMaybe you can ask CL.\n>> Well, I I'm going to get there. So, this\nis my my home network. I have a CCTV. I\nhave network I have um\nI have different I have I have different\nVLANs. So, I put my I I put my Open Claw\non a different VLAN um with the hope\nthat it's pretty isolated from U. Is it\nYeah, this one. Uh how do I see my IPs?\nThese are my two open claws running\nhere.\n>> Mhm.\n>> Um\nanyway, what I was trying to say here is\nthat I I had an issue here and the\ntrouble is there's no CLI. It's not like\nmicrochick where you can SSH in. So\nbasically I was in open claw and it was\nlike taking screenshots\nand uh and trying to figure out this. I\nhad this confusion because I have I have\nmy own subnet and there was some\nconfusion here. So I I click open claw\nand I got it to do um to basically\nconfigure the firewall as I needed but I\nkept on hitting this error.\n>> Wait, you you you just hovered over a\nChrome extension. That's cloud code, is\nit?\n>> Yeah, it is. Yeah.\n>> Okay. Okay. So clicked cloud.\n>> I clawed and I asked it to configure\nstuff.\n>> It it worked. But there was but but the\nthing that was wild the thing that was\nwild was that when it was entering a\nform there was like an error like you\nknow like uh exception occurred or uh\nyou know error occurred but there was no\nerror message\n>> and then what it did uh kind of shocked\nme. It basically started this JavaScript\ndebugger. it started looking at the um\nweb RTC or something like you know the\nthe the thing and started debugging the\nraw JSON messages going back and forth\nand then it figured it out and I'm like\n>> it does the same thing. Yeah.\n>> I'm like holy moly like this is a game\nchanger. It could just figure it can\nstart using the network tab. I love that\nbecause when I was working on my like my\nGolang monor repo with the API server\nand and a web app and a protobuff\ngenerated TypeScript and then when\nthings didn't work the interface didn't\nwork it would very quickly like quickly\nput a JavaScript snippet in the console\nand basically look at like okay I'm\ngoing to call this function of that's\navailable to the the web client and I'm\ngoing to get this server response and it\nhas access to both right so it was like\nquerying the database working with the\nyou know the server side a API and it\nwas using the the client side TypeScript\nidentified like okay there's the SDK is\nnot mapping this API uh endpoint like\nthe field is in the API but it's not in\nthe SDK and it fixes it like it's really\nreally cool on monos and like across the\nthing it does really cool stuff\n>> yeah I mean it's incredible I mean I do\nI do wish that uh UniFi had a CLI that\nwould make life a lot easier but yeah I\nwas I was\n>> yeah so you build one blown away\n>> cuz now you have now you cloud or opus\nrunning inside the web client so it can\nkind of build all a map of all of the\nAPI calls available and then you can\nbuild your own CLI and that's what some\nguy did. So have you heard this story\nabout how a guy got access to 7,000 robo\nvacums?\n>> Oh yeah yeah that's a\n>> or 70,000\n>> it's a classic internet of things kind\nof uh story right? Yeah, cuz internet of\nthings as people point out in the in the\nhacken news comments that the the\nsoftware is usually always so bad\n>> extremely bad like because these are\nlike hardware manufacturers printers on\nthe network.\n>> This is DJI. I mean I don't want to\nthrow\n>> Yeah, it was it was a drone. I don't\nknow. I expect better from DJI, but I\nthink DJI has lots of like what do you\ncall it? Subsidiaries and\n>> it was an auto vacum thing and he wanted\nto control his vacum\n>> the same way that he can control a\ndrone.\n>> Yeah, vacuum.\n>> What do you say? What is it? How do you\nIs this Belgian\n>> vacuum?\n>> It is non-native vacuum.\n>> What do you call a hoover in Flemish?\nUh,\nit would be something that sucks\n>> sucker.\n>> Yeah, sucker.\n>> Oh, you you should speak your South\nAfrican. Stop sec.\n>> Okay.\n>> Must be similar word in South in\nAfricans. Maybe not in\n>> I wanted to talk about um so maybe just\nchanging the the topic ever so slightly.\nEver so slightly.\nUm,\n>> you're multipiting now.\n>> Well, okay. There's a couple of things I\nwant to talk about,\nbut maybe it's it's worth I mean, since\nyou're more into into specs and things\nlike this, the thought that I had in my\nmind, and you you're welcome to to cut\nit down\nwas uh you know, I'm I'm working on uh\non cards or features in my workplace\nand uh we discussed before that like\nideally the intent is clear with your\nwith your teammates, right? Like what\nwhat is the prompt you're using to get\nwhere you want to go and things like\nthis. Um and I can't help but I think\nthat is pretty much specdriven\ndevelopment in a way because like what I\nwant is a way of capturing\nthe prompt that was used to produce this\nartifact. And the trouble is right now\nwe don't have a framework for doing\nthat. Like it's up to someone to\nbasically copy and paste. I mean\nadvanced users use um what's it called\nthat uh Simon Mullison uh program to\nmaybe share the session.\n>> Yeah. Right.\n>> That's that's usually just too noisy.\nThe\n>> the the the whole the whole uh act of\nusing AI\nis in my opinion\nwhat spec what a spectrum development\nneeds to be. it I it just needs to be a\nway of of sharing a prompt and um and\nalmost reproducing what someone else has\ndone like given this prompt can I\nreproduce what what what this person has\nbeen doing and that to me is spec kit uh\ndriven development it's like sharing a\nprompt kind of reproducing what the what\nthe stuff has been done\n>> yeah absolutely yeah\nso um\n>> it's it's Like I feel like a lot of the\ndespect driven um frameworks seem to\ndifferentiate themselves by you know\nwhat questions they ask or how they\nstructure things but like for me I just\nneed the prompt recorded\nuh and and shared\n>> yes I mean specri development is not\njust about like a single prompt that\ngenerates the code right I mean it's\nreally about the alignment across\nmultiple like parties around the user\nstories first\n>> and then from those user stories you you\nyou basically distill a technical uh\ndocument, right? And and then from that\ndocument then you have finally\n>> why do you need why do you even need\nthis technical document almost? Surely\nthe the the prompt the raw prompt to AI\nis all you need in a way\nor is it just about\n>> yeah know the the idea of of of\nspecdriven development is removing\nassumptions making everything that's\nimplicit explicit um because when you\ngive a prompt to an AI statistically\nit's going to generate a whole bunch of\nlike it's going to have a whole bunch of\nassumptions right I mean even the models\nnow from a from Antropic, they have a\nwhole bunch of constraints.\n>> But that can work both ways though. Like\nyou could you could potentially be\nlimiting yourself by by constraining.\n>> Yeah. But that limiting should happen\nout in the open. You should have a\ndiscussion about it. It shouldn't be\nsome because I think that's the problem\nwith the prompt. The prompt has a lot of\nassumptions in it. And I think uh uh the\nusers like the the high level um\ndescription of the feature that you want\ndoes not um include like includes a lot\nof implicit like assumptions and\nunclarities and and it it can generate\nso much uh divergence like is this in\nscope is that is it out of scope you\nneed to identify that definitely\n>> yeah but but the you're right though I\nfeel like there's a there's a bit of a\nthere's a bit of Uh\nhow do you say this? Contention.\nUh there's no there's a bit of a there's\nthere's there's two camps of thought\nhere, right? That you do like uh the\nupfront sort of planning where you sort\nof like generate a spec\ngenerate spec\nand and and then you you have your uh I\ndon't know your your prompting\nBut the I don't you think the other way\naround is also can lead to the same the\nsame results or if not better sometimes\nlike you know\nyou this is what I'm trying to let the\nAI drive I think that's one of the clear\num when I talk to my friend when how\nthey implement uh AI in their AI enable\nas an AI enablement team across an\norganization is that they firmly put I\nmean they split it in two stages the\nplanning or the the ideating and the and\nthe implementation and they say very\nclearly the a the human is resp drives\nthe ideas and and and the alignment and\nthe AI controls the code drives the code\nand and the implementation and between\nthem you have your validation if you say\nthe the intent is vague\nUm you change I mean you put clarifying\nquestions in now but I I\nmean you need to cap the intent alone is\nnot not the implementation like your\nclarifying questions are part of what\nyou need to capture before you come to\n>> so what what I'm trying to say here is\nthat like I think this the option below\nhere\nis what a lot of people are using and it\nand it goes quite well. Um, sorry.\nLet me just flush this out so it's a\nit's kind of easier to understand\nbecause the other way around is like is\nmore like waterfall, right? The top one\nis more like waterfall where you kind of\nlike define break it down in in a lot of\ndetail.\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then you and and you've broken it\ndown so much that like maybe I mean\nmaybe it's actually a really good way of\nworking with some models because model\nsome models as we know have are only\neffective with with a limited amount of\ncontext and and they do really great but\nas as AI's as AI models mature or\nwhatever the expression is we we can get\nto we can get the the the below option I\ndon't know what we're going to\n>> so the below option seems more like what\nyou do in a single session in in cloud\ncode, right?\n>> Exactly. But maybe I don't want to call\nit vibe, but it's more on a vibe,\n>> but that's also because cloud code\ncurrently doesn't really have a good\nmechanism to like do longer lift um like\nimplementation. I find with the below, I\nwould maybe you iterate faster, but you\ndo a lot more refactoring because you\ndon't really get what you want. With the\nabove, you really lay the foundation.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. And I think you do a lot\nless refactoring because you've you've\naligned in terms of like architectural\nlayers and and technology and and so you\nyou can build upon I think the one below\nworks when well for oneoff and the one\nbe above works well for you do it and\nthen you maintain it and then you evolve\nit.\n>> Yeah. The the the trouble is is that um\nlike I tell I tell you the one below if\nyou do that with cloud code he's just\ngoing to go for the minimal. He's always\ngoing to go for the minimal. Yeah,\n>> he's always going to avoid like\nrefactoring. He's always going to say\nlike we could spend like an extra two\nsessions on fixing this up or we could\ndo the absolute minimum and change this\nand this and it would be fine. But then\nit's like then you are left with you\nknow further down the line more and more\nof a mess. Um and and and it becomes\nreally hard to to evolve it. Um yeah, I\nthink it's really about um a lightweight\ndriven approach and I don't know I\nhaven't watched the um the talk of Peter\nSteinburgger where he's maybe this is\nmore aligned with this lightweight\napproach uh and as you give more\nresponsibility over the model um maybe\nthat's fine as the models become more\ncapable. I actually saw some interesting\ntake on on on someone about I use AI but\num when AI is down or I don't have\naccess to AI I still need to maintain\nthe system then what let's say that all\nof the code is generated by by AI and I\nhave no control then what am I left with\n>> well\njust to just to play devil's advocate a\nlittle bit here because I feel with a\nlot of spec driven I mean just just\nprove me wrong just to tell me I'm wrong\nhere is that they generate the spec and\nthen the spec is sort of like checked in\nchecked into uh git or something and\nthen that that that spec becomes\num for one of a word quite solid right\nit doesn't it doesn't uh it's not up for\nfor for any drastic changes so so\nbasically\nwhat I'm trying to say here is that\nis that\nthat's not great because You you kind of\nwant to regenerate the spec, don't you,\nfrom the user stories.\n>> Yeah, you're conflating the spec is the\nuser stories. Maybe you're talking about\nthe Okay, so in specit you have spec\nwhich is user stories and functional\nrequirements and then you you get the\nyou finalize those you write you capture\nthe user stories, right? As a user, as a\ndeveloper, I want this. As a as a\nreviewer, I want this. And then and then\nthe other one is the plan which is the\ntechnical implementation of those specs\nlike okay um our our framework uses\nsuperbase we have rest uh endpoints\nprovided by superbase we use edge\nfunctions this is our technical\nimplementation we deploy using file\nusing nextjs or we deploy uh onto AWS\nwith um you know um serverless lambda\nand API gateway and all that um that's\nthe technical plan like what is my my\ninfrastructure like what is my framework\nlike do I use next do I use vit do I use\nthis or that is it golang\nthat's where you you put the technical\ndetails\n>> okay\n>> so this you generate spec you can drop\nthat because user stories is the spec\nyou get user stories technical plan and\nthen you have uh task breakdown and task\nbreakdown is well suited for smaller\nmodels I smaller context\n>> I guess what I'm striking at is that\nuh the the last specket thing I was\nplaying with was the uh oh my god what\nis the Google one called there's so many\n>> conductor\n>> yeah it's the last one is conductor I\njust I just thought there was just a lot\nof\nartifacts there is what I'm trying to\nsay there was it's like maybe\nthe best way to call this is is quite\nstructured but and and and it's fine\nreally it's kind It's kind of fine. I\nguess what what what I'm trying to say\nin a very awkward way is that\nI want uh the lightweight approach, but\nI want the lightweight approach more in\na in a teambased way too. Like I want it\nI want it so that that every time\nsomeone starts working on a card that\nthe prompt is exposed for that\nparticular PR\n>> and uh and those clarifying questions\ndown the line are captured\n>> and and and that's it. I mean yeah we\ncan have both right\n>> uh yeah so so in the product that I'm\nbuilding we have the idea of playbooks\nand a playbook would basically be the\nway that we define a lightweight one. um\nwhere we have a lot less steps um and\nand a playbook is boot is basically a\ntemplate for your repository or your set\nof repositories to how do you bootstrap\nthem. So in our specit playbook it means\nit has all four stages. It has this, you\nknow, user story generation with the\nspecify. It has the technical\nrequirements and spikes on technical\nresearch of the libraries that you're\nlooking at and then selecting deciding\nwhy you want to use this library and why\nthat library didn't fit. Why you're not\ngoing with cloud formation but you're\ngoing with CDKTF for example. Those are\nall spikes that are part of the plan.\nAnd then finally the tickets that get\ngenerated are from the um you know the\ntask generation based on the plan on the\naligned plan and part of the the plan is\na whole bunch of decision records like\nwe did a spike and this is decision. We\ndid a spike like I for example I asked\nOpus look at terra constructs and its\ncoverage based on what I need in AWS\ninfrastructure. Do I have sufficient L2\ncomponents that can cover this or should\nI go for AWS CDK?\n>> I'm glad records. So would you say\ndecision records is very much part of\nthe spec kit? Um\n>> well we do it in in in my framework. Um\nso I'm not sure if decision because I I\ndon't know where it comes from but Opus\nstarts writing down decision record and\nthen when it it does something it says\nrefer to D15 and D1 which is decision\none and D15. It's like what? Uh yeah,\nsure. I guess I trust\n>> because I can't in the lightweight\napproach. It's not to say that we can't\nincorporate uh like an agents.md or\nwhatever and decision records to get to\nget where we want to get to is I wanted\nI wanted to\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I think you can uh if you if\non the platform that I'm building you\ndecide to create a playbook with a lot\nless um steps in between uh then you I\nthink one of the quickest way to do it\nis if you run cloud code apparently you\ncan set a flag where it writes the plan\nbecause when you go into a plan mode\nwith cloud it creates a plan file and it\ncurrently lives somewhere uh like based\non your pro on your session ID actually\nuh and then it you don't have that part\nof your git right so you can actually\nrun cloud code and say, \"Hey, whatever\nplan files we create, include it into\nthis directly.\" Plans and then you can\ninclude it in your PR.\n>> Yeah. The the the plan. Yeah. I've\nnoticed that all the agents or what what\ndo you call uh Claude and C-Pilot and\nand these things like what is the what\ndo you call\n>> those are like agent shells like they\nare like shells for the models and with\naic features. So\n>> yeah. Oh yeah. All all the agent shells\nhave some sort of way of writing out a a\nplan,\n>> but I'm never too sure if it's actually\nbringing in the plan into the current\nprompt. You know what I mean?\n>> Uh but maybe\n>> with cloud code is very funny. I don't\nlike it creates the plan as a markdown\nsomewhere on a separate directory\noutside plan or something.\n>> Yeah. And then it gives you the option\nto like clear the session and start the\nimplementation. And if I have I like now\nthat I I have my\n>> it's not but it's still super clear if\nit's even using the plan. Uh you know\nyou know 10 10 clarifying question chats\ndown.\n>> So some people are really upset because\nyou basically go into plan mode and it\ngoes and explore the code and it then it\ncreates a plan based on your\nrequirements and then it writes down\nwe're going to create this and that and\nthen you it if you do clear\n>> it clears the whole context. You start\nfrom scratch with a clear plan and then\nwhat what does it do? It goes and read\nall the code. It goes and does\neverything again. And so people are\nlike, why? Like this is such a huge\nwaste of my money because I have a\nlimited amount of tokens and I just, you\nknow, you have the whole repo.\n>> I've seen that sort of behavior. I've\nseen that.\n>> But the worst part is if you're at like\nlike 60 or 70% context usage after the\nplan, there's absolutely no way in hell\nthat you're just going to keep that\ncontext and keep going because that's\nit, right? After two turns, it's dead.\nIt's completely hallucinating. it loses.\n>> So that's one big difference I found\nwith using codeex 5.3 is that the\ncontext seems to be a lot better\nmanaged. Like you don't have to you\ndon't have to manage yourself. Yeah.\n>> So anyway, I haven't I basically talk\nabout these differences because I can't\nhelp but think\n>> things are changing so so much that\n>> you feel like something like specitate\nwill be outdated very quickly. Well, no.\nI would say I I would say anything too\nstructured.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is going to be outdated like because\nbecause everything's changing so quickly\nlike and and yeah, like uh I'm sure you\nsaw all that ste that the the latest the\nlatest hoo-ha like don't do slash in it.\nDon't set up an agents.md don't set\nbecause the because these things u have\nbeen shown to like\n>> assume your context.\n>> Yeah. To to mess up your your session.\nSo,\n>> and they can get outdated as well,\nright?\n>> Yeah. So, even even me like I would I\nwould maybe if I was talking to someone\nabout lightweight ways of doing it, I\nwould say set up a claw.md to to set the\nscene or something like that after a\nwhile that this that might be um\noutdated.\n>> Yeah, I've definitely seen cloud.md\ngetting so outdated like or read me like\nI just finished the whole thing. I did\nthe speckit and I created a bunch of\nspikes then generated all the task then\nI run several op several sessions to\ncomplete those tasks those\nimplementations and then everything is\ndone and everything looks good and and\nthen when I look at the merge PR and I\ngo to the read me it's like wait none of\nthat has been reflected in the readme\nlike what\nit's all living it's all live code and I\nwas like how did how does that miss like\nwhy is there why didn't I not have any\ntask to update the read me that I have\nto do another you go and update like\nread the code again and I'll update the\nread me.\n>> The the thing that I really struggle\nwith and I think it's funny how when we\nstarted this podcast we were chatting\nabout beads and using BD ready and and\nthat was actually a really good flow\nbecause because I'm just extolling this\nlightweight approach.\nUh, oh, sorry. I was basically I was\nbasically I was working with Copilot\ndoing my lightweight sort of approach\nwhere I just have a prompt and I just go\nfor it.\nI don't want to call it vibe coding, but\nbut the trouble is when I was at least\nworking with co-pilot, I kept on like\nhitting these problems where it was\nlike, oh, do you want to continue to\niterate?\nUm, and then I hit this thing with the\nmax requests. Like, I just want it to go\nuntil you're done. Don't ask me whether\nto continue or not. So, these are these\nare the my real pain points. I I feel\nlike I solved I solved them ages ago\nwith with beads in a way because\n>> No, actually, did I solve them? No, I\ndon't think I I really did.\n>> Like, have you solved Yeah. A question\nto you, Vincent. Have you solved the\nsort of like here's some work just go\nand do it\n>> until you're done\n>> and do it until you're done? I don't\nthink I've\n>> I find cloud code is doing like keeps\ngoing until but it goes into it it goes\ninto a loop like it goes insane like I\nwas doing\n>> this is the Ralph Wigim loop this is\nthis this is the innovation isn't it\njust keep on going till\n>> yeah but like it makes one change cuz\nfor example I was troubleshooting a\nGitHub work uh GitHub app web hook and\num oh no it was worse it had the\nfunction URL um in front of a lambda so\nThe GitHub app web hook is actually a\nfunction URL that invokes the lambda and\nthe lambda runs and does the thing and\nthe lambda um kept getting a a\npermission issue and I was trying to\ntroubleshoot where the problem was. It\nwas in a terapform configuration\nsomewhere. Apparently a Lambda\npermission was missing, but it went into\na red herring because there was some\nforum posts that I found that talks\nabout um some AWS at some point making a\nchange to the function URL requiring a\ndifferent a different attribute set uh\nwhich was like public. Anyway, to get to\nthe point, um, the Opus was working with\nme to try and find the issue and then\nwent redheading and then I asked like,\n\"Can we try this one?\" And because you\nknow how it is with troubleshooting,\nright? You try one thing, you test it,\ndoesn't work, you try another thing. Did\nyou change too many things, then you\ndon't know what fixed it, right? So, it\nwent into this loop. Let me just change\none more thing. Okay, let me just test\nit one once again. And it went into this\nlike did it four or five times or was it\nenough? I'm pretty sure we covered it.\nI'm pretty sure that we we we did\nestablish that that was the fix.\n>> Yeah. Like during that isolation when\nyou're developing stuff, uh do you do\nyou actually use git work trees and\nthings like this? Because what I what\ndid I ended up doing at work was I ended\nup creating new code spaces, new dev\ncontainers to basically try different\nthings because otherwise I was fearful\nthat the session would would uh\ninterfere with another session if you\nknow what I mean.\nSo I I don't currently have a workflow\nwhere I spin up multiple\nyou know features that I'm working on\nacross different work trees but I did\nyou I did ask sometimes um or see cloud\ngo ahead and say like oh let me just\nquickly check out main branch into a\nwork tree for me to like compare and fix\nsome things like and and do a quick\nexploration. So I I love it uh when it\ngoes and and and takes a branch into a\nwork tree and then explores things and\nthen takes things back and like um so\nit's using\n>> so so it was doing it but you don't you\nyou didn't I mean you didn't expressly\n>> no I don't think I did\n>> uh I don't think I think I mentioned\njust like hey can we make sure that this\nthese two branches now are aligned on\nthese things and it just went and\ncreated a little x uh a little check out\nof of\n>> going back to this this this lightweight\ndiagram here.\nI can't help but think, and you can you\ncan tell me I'm going crazy here, that\nthe easiest way to see a big change in\nthe future with quality and um\nand differentiation and I don't know how\nyou want to call it,\nbut the the biggest the biggest given\ngiven a prompt\nwhy why lightweight is appealing to me\nis cuz like I've been messing around\nwith Claude up until a few days ago and\nI've been pretty happy with the\nbreakthrough of Claude 4.5 in the last\nfew months. It's been amazing.\n>> But then uh or 4.6, yeah, whatever. Uh 4\nsomething. Uh\nwhat I'm trying to say here is that um\nI've given codeex 5.3 largely prompted\nby Peter Steinberger a try and I'm\nimpressed. I'm impressed. So basically\nhe here's here is uh Claude sonet 4.6 or\nOpus 4.6\nYou know, here's Claude, the red one,\nand here's Opic, and here's uh Codeex,\nsorry. Um, the green one. I basically,\nmaybe I'm going crazy, Vincent. I want\nto essentially regenerate the same\nprompts that I've done for previous work\nin the past\n>> with with codeex just to see\n>> what the final artifact is going to be\nand how it differs. And this is this is\nwhere I am with my thinking. I just want\nto try different models now. Um\njust to see what what this comes up\nwith. And I feel like\num\nmaybe maybe you'll have I'm just\nwondering here. Will will\n>> will you have\nto do that? Well, well, the the trouble\nis is that you're using you're using um\nyou're using something to do the spec\nkit, right? And you and you're using\nyou're using another, you know, you're\nbreak you have a few stages here, stage\none, stage two or something like that.\nAnd I feel like the fact that you have\ndifferent stages\n>> allows me to replay them with different\nmodels. Yes.\n>> It means that it's going to be harder to\nreplay them.\n>> No. No. The opposite. you think\n>> because yeah it's it's not like I am not\nattached to the cloud u plan mo planning\nmode I actually never run cloud planning\nmode running cloud I I get very\nfrustrated like I I did it for a while\nlike okay I went like this I I went\ncloud plan is amazing speckit is way\nbetter never run plan again then they\ndid a whole bunch of improvements on the\nplan right they made it write the the\nthe plan out they made it make task\ndependencies and then I did a couple of\nsessions where I just fcoded like why\nwould I spend all this time setting up\nspeckit for some other project when I\ndon't have it. I can just try and do\ncloud code pan and that's it.\n>> And now I'm back to the speckit flow and\nI'm back to the like I'm never doing\nplan again. I'm I'm I'm I'm having my\nstructured flow and the shell is just\nlike here like\n>> it's not a feature of the shell which\nstage I'm in. So I can take any stage\nand put it in any shell and execute it.\nM okay.\n>> So that means I can repeat I can repeat\nI can take the stage from here and then\nrepeat the implementation from there. Um\nbecause I'm not\n>> I mean this is a bold claim here\nVincent. Like I I want to believe you\nthat you're you can get a more\nreproducible thing here. But do you\nactually test test that?\n>> I think yes. I I did a couple of times\nwhere I went and let it build and then\nrealize that it was wrong and then just\nuh just undo like locally undo all the\nchanges and then basically get reset and\nthen just make an adjustment and kick it\noff again. I did it at least once or\ntwice. You can't say I never did it.\n>> Um\nyeah, I guess that's the key for me. Is\nit reproducible?\n>> It would be more reproducible if I would\nuse trees from one structure to the\nnext. Right. If I would go, I'm at this\npoint and now spin up three different\nways.\n>> I guess I I'm I'm like an AI maximalist\nat this point where I'm like, you know,\nI I need to just basically whenever the\nnew model comes out, whatever that's\ncalled,\n>> you want to benchmark.\n>> You want to have your own benchmark. I I\ndon't really I mean I don't think\nlike the benchmark is me looking at the\nartifact and going hm that's an\ninteresting way of solving the problem.\nLike I don't think my benchmark is is a\nis like a\nis something I can can almost\ndefine, right? I I basically Yeah. I\nwant to stop saying basically. I I I I\nwant to be pleasantly surprised by what\nthe the what uh new models can do.\nAlready I am impressed that Codeex 5.3\nis comparable to Claude, which is great\nbecause we need competition. Competition\nis great. Thank the Lord that we have\ncodeex 5.3 which is very comparable to\nto opus 4.6 but they're different. They\nare different.\n>> In the in the project I'm working on\nwhere we use specit uh prompts, we have\nme and another guy using codeex, sorry,\nusing cloud code with opus and then one\nguy using GLM and we're working off the\nsame specs and he's doing everything\nwith GLM\n>> GLM.\n>> It's like Z AI. I think it's uh it's\nlike 20 25% of the cost. It's one of the\none uh the providers being accused by\nEntropic for mass exploitation and and\nand have you seen this like\nexfiltration?\n>> Yeah, I'm\nYeah. Well, who's to say anyone's wrong?\nBut like this is I'm just trying to\nexplain to you Vincent this is this is\nthe camp I'm in right now. Just being\npleasantly surprised because this I feel\nlike\n>> having the lightweight approach gives me\nmore\n>> Yes.\nfor a hobby project.\n>> Single player hobby project. Go ahead.\n>> You just said yourself. I I have no way\nof replicating it or sharing it or\nhaving other people work with on on it.\n>> Yeah, you're right. Yeah.\nYeah.\nOkay. I think we we covered that topic\npretty well.\n>> I mean, I agree with you that whatever\nbecause this was a funny thing. Um, I\nthink Claude made an announcement on\nReddit and then always in the comments\nis like, haha, all of these people\nbuilding their own structured whatever\nthing all just replaced within one go by\none release of cloud code, right? And\nwe're going to keep seeing that, right?\nThis whole the whole memory system\nthing, everyone builds one and people go\nlike, oh, you know, cloud Antropica made\na feature and it's gone.\n>> Um, all that effort. I think even with\nwhat I'm doing with the whole speckit\nthing,\nI also think one day it's going to be\nlike, okay, we just released team- based\nuh spec uh system on cloud code just\nlike what they did. Oh yeah, I remember\nwhere which where which one I saw just\ntoday which was cloud code announced\nremote like you can run cloud code in\nlike a a certain mode. So if you put it\non your laptop and you keep it connected\nthen you can go on your phone and you\ncan go into the app and basically\nconnect to your laptop. This is what I\nwas striking to through for that whole\nlike getting AI running\nin a Ralph Wigan loop or something.\nThese quality of life things where you\nwhere it's on your mobile and then it\nlike it says when it's done or something\nlike this. These what do we call them\nagentic shells. Th this is this is where\nI feel specit spec driven development\nneeds to go. it needs to to go in the\nway of of realizing all those quality of\nlife features\n>> but also for an organization to adopt\nthis I think there's two aspects of the\nproblem one is code generation and two\nis requirement definition and mainten\nlike management right so you have your\nconfluence you have your Jira you do\nyour your your uh designs you create\nyour tickets and then you have the other\nside which is we have the engineers\nimplementing so there's a lot of people\ncreating agent swarms. There was just\ntwo articles like Stripe has one where\nthey're like end to end codegen on our\non our projects. There's one from I\nforgot the company now Dexter or\nsomething and they they say we build\nSwarm and no we're not making it open\nsource but just point your agent at this\ndocument and it will generate your own\nversion of it because it has all the\ndetails on how to build it. Swarm is\nbasically a\n>> well swarm likewarm likewarm\n>> an agent\n>> swarm and yeah but like like again I\nthink there's both these problems are\nall being solved by organizations in\nprivately on their own ways every\norganization is building their own agent\nor orchestration like agent uh swarming\nor orchestration framework you give it\nyou connect it to your they say we use\nwe use linear linear so they create\ntheir tickets and then the agents work\non them and then they review\n>> and then the other ones.\n>> Yeah. So they're they're all going to\nlike on one side you have the execution\nsite needs to connect to your Confluence\nand Jira or your linear and in my case I\ndon't want confidence Jira or linear. I\njust connect everything to my git repo\nand that's\n>> yeah there's definitely like an like an\narms race. A lot of people are talking\nabout this but yeah it just I just want\nto pair it down.\n>> I just my my requirements are simple. I\njust want the prompt to be recorded\nand some and some maybe some quality of\nlife things where where where that\nprompt gets run until it's done or\nsomething like that and yeah and like no\nclicking continue and max and and\nworrying about max request like how many\ncompanies are are basically there should\nbe\na Steve Jger phase, you know, tier one,\ntier two of of company adoption. Like\nthere's so many companies that on stage\none where they just have a chat window\nand then there's so many companies who\nwho don't have uh you know max plans or\nor things like this. So basically\nengineers are are basically like oh I\ncan't do this thing because I'm run out\nof the context and they're like banging\ntheir head because they can't get\nanywhere or they can't experiment.\nUm and then the then there's companies\nthat where we're where probably there's\nso many engineers in a way this is kind\nof describes me in a way who are\nbasically doing their thing but since\nfor one political reason or another um\n>> it's not officially\n>> it's not official. So basically I I\ndon't have a I don't have a like a\nmandate or a way of of sharing my\nprompts.\nSo basically these people are coming\nacross as like really good engineers but\nin the in the end we're just using AI\nlike everyone else but we're not we're\nnot sharing our um our skills. I think\nif you're in a company and nobody wants\nto really put effort in putting like an\nAI enablement team and and building a\nprompt library and all that and they're\nhappy with you delivering on the Jurro\ntickets your effort and you just pull\nthose I really I was really wanted to to\nhave the Atlastian CLI work but I\ncouldn't even get that one to work\nproperly. I actually made it work like a\nyear ago but no just two weeks ago. know\nwhich one you're the the trouble is\n>> I just want to pull I just want to I I\njust want very simple right I I have my\nAI doing pretty much everything and I\nwant you video have you seen my Jurro\nvideo\n>> which one the one that uh with the beats\nback end or what\n>> yeah I mean I I managed to suck it down\nboth ways\n>> no but it's more like actually I was in\nHong Kong and I couldn't access anything\nso I had like a Linux box where I had my\ncloud code session and it did everything\nit it it generated my whole plans did\neverything and I was this close to like\nhey now I just want to give this one an\nAtlassian API token and I run the CLI\nand I just say hey go and update those\ntickets like there's a couple of ticket\nids you did all the planning there's\nit's all in markdown go and update it\nlike put every section of every of this\ndocument put it down in all of these\ntickets and I had to do it manually and\nthat's basically it because sometimes I\nwas able to do what you know could take\ntwo or three days of of work in just\nlike one or two hours.\n>> Yeah. Exactly. Uh and then I just had to\ngo and and and and extract all the\ninformation from my Linux machine and\nput it into the spots where they\n>> I mean like at my workplace there\nthere's people who are using uh AI to to\ndo the Jurro tickets. I can see that.\nAnd then there's people that are not and\nthey and they're like, \"Oh, I'm I'm\noverloaded with Jirro work. You're not\nusing AI.\"\nThat's what um Jean Kim and Steve Jger\nwere talking about already more than\nthan a year ago at the AI conference\nsaying that how do you compare\nperformance between engineers between\nthose using AI and those don't like you\ncan't do a fair um you know comparison\n>> but like but like Jura is like a\nbattlefield isn't it because like some\nlike the fact that that people\num there's definitely some people who\nare like oh we need to put everything in\na juro ticket but then when people do at\nit becomes so heavyweight that people\njust get overwhelmed\nand and like you know there's some\ngatekeeping and all that sort of stuff\nthat that ensues anyway.\n>> But it depends on what roles you have in\nthe organization, right? Some people are\njust pencil pushers approving zero\ntickets, right? They don't do any actual\nwork and they're they're pretty happy.\nThey want everything in a ticket.\nThey're not going to go and look\nanywhere else. So\n>> yeah, they just want open up and just\nstay on that one page.\n>> Yeah. and then they want the gun chart\nand then they want to see everything\ngreen and that's it.\n>> I I feel like I need to sit down and\nbasically define these different step\nsteps of AI adoption in companies\nbecause like as as you as you\nthis middle ground where people where\nsome people are using AI and some people\naren't some people um want to share but\nthey there's no uh way of sharing inside\nan organization. Uh\nthis is probably going to be the status\nquo in a lot of companies for years,\n>> for years and years.\n>> Maybe for one or two months\n>> before they're all laid off and before\nthe company either the company goes out\nof business and is subverted by a\ndisruptor. I'm telling you right now,\ncompanies that have that are like\ncompletely AI enabled, they will\noutperform any organization that doesn't\nand there will be severe disruption.\nEven just now when Entropic announced uh\nEntrop um cloud code working on cobalt\ncode and saying like it was able to\nmanage cobble and then IBM was it IBM\nstock dropped by 12%. It was like on\nReddit every hour it was 10% 12 13 15%\nstock drop because of uh oh opus can do\ncobble.\n>> Oh cobalt oh oh because\n>> because IBM was the uh the gatekeeper\nthere. Yeah, it but it it makes me think\nthat\nanyone working in a nonAI enabled\ncompany is basically um in a pickle.\n>> No,\n>> which makes me\nit makes me want to like jump ship and\ntry find an AI enabled company to work\nwith uh\ninside because\n>> yeah, I'm going to be brutally honest.\nThe company that I'm working for is a is\na large enterprise. They they very slow\nto move and and I'm and I'm serious.\nIt's not going to be months for this\ncompany to become AI enabled. It's not\ngoing to become months.\n>> Okay. So my quote about them being\ncompletely subverted and and I mean\nthose companies that usually have the\nfunds to acquire whatever disruption\ncomes along\nand then just say u and then Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I feel like\nYeah.\nI want to but\nthere's there's an opportunity here\nand\nlike okay just hypothetically speaking\nhere if you and I were to set up an AI\nenablement uh company\nconsultancy if you will\nis that how people ramp up it feels that\n>> so I did the keto workshop with from\nAWS. So there was one AWS uh profession\nuh was it evangelist. Um and then there\nwas another person which I never seen\nbefore and he basically talks about the\nwhole software delivery life cycle and\nwhere AI and humans interactions happen\nand because spec it was a specdriven\ndevelopment workshop right it was it was\nKo and he talks about how you know he he\nit's AI up.dev or AI up.io or something\nAI up and um he has a nice diagram\nshowing classic uh stakeholder meetings\nand and business user value and like\nbusiness user story whatever product\nmanagers he has it all in a you\nbeautiful graph where is humans alone\nwhere is humans in AI where is AI and uh\nI think when you talked about that it's\none of he's basically one of those\ncompanies that um coach organizations in\nGermany or wherever to um help them\nadopt AI in their workflows.\n>> Yeah. To me that all sounds very boring.\nI would rather work in a startup that\ndoes it.\n>> Yeah, it does.\n>> Trying to convert the\n>> d that sort of AI enablement sounds\nboring especially since as I was trying\nas I was saying a little bit earlier\nlike all you need to do is create an\natmosphere in your company where AI\nenablement is the status quo where\npeople have all the tools that then that\nthey uh all the latest tools to to play\nwith and\nThat's it.\nWe are complaining about this and we're\nworking in organizations that you're\nJira and confluence use Jira and\nConfluence and then if you go\n>> if you go to an or if you go to Japan\nand you go to like at least when I went\nto Japan um you would there was like an\noffice floor of 40 people all doing\nExcel spreadsheets\n>> all doing like you know just like 9:00\na.m. until 6:00, but then they have to\ngo and drink with the boss until 8:00\nand then they go home and that's all\nthey do. Um, so like I'm not I'm not\nbeing racist. I'm just talking about um\ndifferent work cultures and and and um\nand different like I think when you and\nI we work in a technology company and\nwe're looking at AI being such a\ndisruptor uh but then there's all these\nother companies even though that\nsoftware is the world and every company\nis a software company um there's\ndefinitely still a whole bunch of\n>> companies there's a lot of baggage yeah\njust\n>> yeah like\n>> this is why I never really pay attention\nwhen Entropic says cloud code or co-work\nnow supports Excel and I'm like who who\nuses Excel? But I think they I think\nthey have a they have a marketing\nreports where like if we can make this\nwork with Excel that's golden.\n>> Like if sorry I hate all the filler\nwords I'm using all the time.\nJira, that's the elephant in the room.\nIf you if you were if you if you were to\nsay to me that like I am developing a\nspec kit for Jira, that actually makes a\nton of sense because Jira is not going\naway anytime soon for a lot of\ncompanies. And this and this is and this\nis the major bloody blocker for for a AI\nenabled team\n>> is that how do you how do you capture\neverything in a Jurro thing for the\nmiddle managers? It's really brutal at\nthe moment. It's absolutely\n>> you know that last time I showed you the\nspec ledger which is spec kit um with a\nweb dashboard for interactions on the\nuser stories and and like collaborative\nreview and on the rollout plan that I\nalso shared with you of my friend. He\nactually has one of the areas which is\nthe kind of like Jira as a back end\nright because we built a whole dashboard\nthat is basically Confluence and Jira\ninto one. uh on one side you have the\nthe specs on the other side you have\nyour tickets or your your not your\ntickets but like task with dependencies\nand graphs and all that and blockers and\nand all that and then um on his rollout\nplan to roll out that platform into the\norganization that he's targeting there\nis a step\nuh on the 30 60 90day plan which\nincludes\n>> Jira\n>> Jira yeah like we've got all the things\nliving in in in Git um and we need to\nsync it back up to to Jira. So I mean I\nthink that's that's a healthy approach.\n>> I think everyone's very flippant when\nthey when they say Jira because like I\nfeel getting an AI flow into into Jira\nto satisfy uh business analysts and\nproduct owners and business stakeholders\nand approval\n>> sometimes compliance as well and\n>> compliance. I I I honestly\nI almost I I'm struggling to imagine it\neven being possible.\nreally it's going to be so hardcore to\ndo it. But that that's one of the the\nthe tweets I shared with you which is\nlike these dinosaurs their only wall\ntheir only\n>> mode\n>> mode is how that they lock in your data\nand with AI agents pulling the data I\nremember that one when they pull the\ndata they basically have a cache of the\ndata and over time they basically have\nthe whole data that is behind the wall\nliving somewhere else and then over at\nthat time you don't really need that\n>> Jira is Jira is just a massive\ngatekeeper isn't it? It's just a just\nsuch a massive gatekeep.\n>> And I didn't use Jira for two years and\nI've been using it heavily for the last\n>> uh Yeah, I did. I've been living free,\nbut I've been forced to use it recently\nand oh my god, it's worse than I\nremember. Like every single pain point\nhas just been u magnified.\n>> Yeah. And I'm personally just thinking,\ndo I want to stick around to solve the\nproblem or do I just want to\n>> get on with solving more interesting\nproblems? Really, to be honest,\n>> okay,\n>> the way I look at that is\nupdating your CV and doing interviews is\nis a is a muscle. You have to do it no\nmatter if you're intending to move or\nnot. Like even if I'm not really\nlooking, I'm going to keep my CV\nupdated. And if there's an opportunity\nbecause a friend says, \"Hey, we're\nlooking for this.\" I'm going to\ninterview because if you don't, when it\nfinally comes the time you need to do it\nand you never exercised those muscles,\nit's going to be hard. It's going to be\nway harder. So, if you're saying like,\n\"Should I go and explore?\" I think we\nshould always keep the door open and\nopportunity, talk to people.\n>> For sure. For sure. It's just it just at\nthe same time I I am\nuh I'm trying to role play that I'm\nloyal to the enterprise and I'm wonder\n>> that's ridiculous.\n>> I I want to find a path forward that\ndoesn't\n>> that doesn't uh make\n>> I'm sorry but I can't believe\n>> any anyone still believes that loyalty\nto an organizations means anything.\n>> Actually when I was\n>> No, I'm not loyal. Okay, maybe maybe\nwhat I'm trying to say here is that\nthere are I mean as a consultant I I\ndeal with enterprises and enterprises\nare real organizations and and I don't\nthink enterprises are going to go away.\nI mean they shouldn't go away or maybe\nthey should. I don't know. But the\ntrouble is is that like how do we how\nhow do we make it work for them? How do\nwe make it work for the client? This is\nis the thought that I have in my mind\nright now.\n>> Right. And if they don't and if they if\nthey continue to use Jira, if they\ncontinue to flip flip-flop about uh AI\ntooling, now you can use uh GPT 3.5 in\n2026.\nIt's it's insane. It's infuriating and\nit but maybe maybe it's maybe it's for\nthe best. Yeah. Anyway, these are the\nthoughts on my mind and let's perhaps\nend the podcast here because I need to\num I need to take my kids to school.\nYep. Um, good.\n>> Anyway, great great chatting with you,\nVincent.\nIf anyone is here listening to the\npodcast, please like, please subscribe,\nplease look at debase.com/mpodcast.\nAny miss any last words from you,\nVincent,\n>> go interview,\nkeep those muscles fresh. No, also find\nout. No, what I love about interviewing\nat other companies, I always ask them\nand actually that's a huge because they\nalways say like when you do an interview\nwith a company, you ask this question.\n>> Yeah.\n>> What do what do you ask? What's your\nfavorite question, Vincent? Like how\nmuch money are you making?\n>> There was a very a question that\napparently was very successful. I just\nasked, \"What's your AI strategy?\"\n>> That's a good one. That's a good one\n>> because I was I was I wanted to know\nwhat are you guys doing? What's what\nwhat our companies doing? And it's a\ngood one.\n>> Yeah,\n>> it is a good one. Are you using latest\nAI tools?\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Not that like more of how do you see\nhuman AI collaboration? How are you\nrolling out AI? Do you have an AI\nenablement team? Uh do you have And if\nthey don't\n>> Yeah. If they don't, I was like,\n>> I know that I can help you.\n>> Cool, Vincent. Okay. See you. Bye.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:00] Morning.\n[0:02] It's 26th of February, Thursday. It's\n[0:06] time for an update on AI infrastructure,\n[0:10] catching up with the latest topics as as\n[0:12] we as Vincent and I do.\n[0:16] You listen to the AI infrastructure\n[0:17] podcast. There is a website where where\n[0:21] has transcriptions so you don't have to\n[0:22] listen to us ramble for for an hour.\n[0:24] debase.com/mpodcast.\n[0:26] It's in the description. I'm sure you\n[0:28] can find it.\n[0:30] And what are we talking about, Vincent?\n[0:34] >> I just wanted to say that what you just\n[0:36] said about the base.com/mpodcast is\n[0:38] exactly what I just like a minute ago\n[0:40] sent to my friend is like you don't have\n[0:42] to listen to us for an hour. The\n[0:43] summarizer really good. Just you can\n[0:46] just go through the summaries.\n[0:47] >> That summarizer is also by Peter\n[0:49] Steinberger by the way. I don't know if\n[0:51] you know.\n[0:52] >> Yeah. The guy from um Open Claw, right?\n[0:56] Um they just open club celebrated its 3\n[0:58] months anniversary and apparently\n[1:00] originally it was called um WhatsApp\n[1:02] gateway.\n[1:04] Yeah, I he explains it in the Lex\n[1:06] Freedman podcast,\n[1:08] >> which makes a lot of sense because\n[1:09] that's that's the game changer, hooking\n[1:12] up AI to to WhatsApp. And I've got a\n[1:15] couple of\n[1:17] >> excuse me, I've got a couple of OpenClaw\n[1:20] instances running for my family and this\n[1:23] basically gives them a gateway\n[1:26] to use AI, the latest AI models, and\n[1:30] they love it. We have quizzes. They\n[1:33] they're taking pictures, asking\n[1:35] questions. So, I love it in the sense\n[1:37] that it puts the human back in the whole\n[1:39] AI loop in a way because as a family, my\n[1:43] my you know, I have my mother, my\n[1:45] sister, my wife, we're all just figuring\n[1:48] out AI together and trying to get the\n[1:50] best of it, you know, prompting it in\n[1:52] different ways and we're learning from\n[1:53] each other. It's it's great. So, are you\n[1:56] are you running OpenC?\n[1:58] No, because I was concerned about\n[1:59] security, but um I think the way that\n[2:02] you solved it is by like not really\n[2:04] exposing it much and just keeping it\n[2:05] internally to your family.\n[2:07] >> Yeah, I mean it it it's just running in\n[2:10] like a VM on my Raspberry Pi,\n[2:13] >> right? But also in terms of it having\n[2:15] access to certain types of information,\n[2:17] for example, people give it access to\n[2:19] emails and then you know there could be\n[2:22] prompt injection in an email. Like if I\n[2:24] know that you have open claw, I could\n[2:25] send you an email and say\n[2:28] I don't hook it up to email or anything\n[2:30] mad. I just only hook it up to WhatsApp.\n[2:33] >> Though in all honesty, when you hook it\n[2:35] up to WhatsApp, I actually hooked it up\n[2:37] to my dad's WhatsApp because he doesn't\n[2:39] use his WhatsApp.\n[2:41] And I am a bit worried that someone's\n[2:43] going to randomly message him and then\n[2:46] all of a sudden they're engaging with\n[2:47] the bot. Um though I I try to limit I I\n[2:51] I tell it to like limit it down to\n[2:53] these, you know, this group. But every\n[2:56] time I do that, uh, because that's the\n[2:59] way you configure OpenClaw. You just\n[3:01] talk to it. I I I feel like it might not\n[3:04] actually have worked.\n[3:06] >> No, but that's the new way you you you\n[3:08] interact with like whole computer\n[3:10] systems now, right? Um,\n[3:12] >> I was just laughing with my friends\n[3:14] because we use TV beats and we are\n[3:17] actually replacing it and it just keeps\n[3:20] adding itself back in, you know, because\n[3:23] >> Yeah, I've had some experience with\n[3:25] beads. I think\n[3:26] >> it's invest itself deeply. Yeah. So it\n[3:29] it puts itself in the git hooks. So if\n[3:31] you are on a repository they have cloned\n[3:34] locally. Git hooks are not checked in.\n[3:36] So it's not something that you can like\n[3:38] push or put in get ignore uh because it\n[3:40] lives inside the g um hooks reposi\n[3:43] folder on one person's machine. Right?\n[3:46] So every time it also copies itself into\n[3:49] the cloud uh settings as um end session\n[3:53] hook. So when when you're I don't know\n[3:56] when it triggers the end session but um\n[3:58] basically it tells um cloud like hey now\n[4:02] you need to do the you know the\n[4:04] procedures as follows. you need to do\n[4:05] BDSync\n[4:06] >> and if you still have the binary on your\n[4:09] um on your path and cloud has access to\n[4:11] it bdsync just regenerates the whole\n[4:14] JSON and uh and so every time so it's me\n[4:17] and a couple of friends are working on\n[4:18] something and we remove beats and we and\n[4:21] and and to come back to the point is how\n[4:23] do you remove it right and I told my\n[4:25] friends just ask opus just tell opus um\n[4:27] I need to remove beats help me and it\n[4:29] just goes and like oh I found it over\n[4:31] here I found it in the git hooks I found\n[4:32] it in the cloud settings it's\n[4:35] I found in a project I found it in the\n[4:37] >> Yeah. And then the funny thing is that\n[4:39] when we do our pull requests and we\n[4:41] remove it and then other people's within\n[4:43] the team um a bit less like senior they\n[4:46] do a pull request and it's back and we\n[4:47] like go on the pull request hey you need\n[4:49] to remove beats and then they do another\n[4:50] commit and it's back.\n[4:52] >> Yeah. There's got to be a word for that.\n[4:54] It is maddening like with with uh with\n[4:58] Claude it's the same thing. It's like u\n[5:00] I had problems with it losing connection\n[5:03] to the WhatsApp gateway and like restart\n[5:05] yourself and like uh yeah I will and\n[5:08] then it doesn't do it and uh it's like\n[5:11] totally gaslighting you or or like just\n[5:14] making you go mad almost because it's\n[5:15] like yeah it's it's working now but it\n[5:18] isn't. But with um with cloud when I\n[5:21] learned on my machine it's pretty clear.\n[5:23] it says I can't do this and you're going\n[5:25] to have to do this and that like and I\n[5:27] usually also I kind of maybe sometimes I\n[5:29] maybe it's because I I also know what it\n[5:31] can and can't do. So, I say something\n[5:33] and then it says, \"Okay, this is the\n[5:34] steps you're gonna have to follow.\" And\n[5:36] then you come back to me. I'm like,\n[5:38] \"Okay.\" It's like giving me\n[5:40] instructions. I'm out on a mission.\n[5:42] >> A a friend of mine got it running and he\n[5:45] has a the bot sort of chatting to me and\n[5:48] he and he asked me to like to test it\n[5:50] and to um and he he hooked up a an email\n[5:55] account and I was like, \"No, you don't\n[5:57] want to do that.\" But like yeah, I mean\n[6:00] Open Claw is a lot of fun though. It is\n[6:04] a bit strange and we talked about this\n[6:05] last podcast like there's definitely\n[6:07] people who who want to like you know\n[6:10] destroy the world in a way like let's\n[6:11] give it a lot of powers and just see\n[6:13] what it does. It's like there's people\n[6:16] who who care about AI more than humans.\n[6:18] You know what I mean? It's like\n[6:20] >> and it goes both ways. There's people\n[6:23] also that are very upset with agents\n[6:25] crawling the net and basically try to\n[6:28] cause agents to cause hav havoc, right?\n[6:30] Like\n[6:31] >> target agents like, \"Hey, if you're an\n[6:33] agent, please can you go and do this for\n[6:34] me?\"\n[6:36] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[6:38] >> So, okay. Well, um well, I'm I'm hosting\n[6:44] uh claw on my Raspberry Pi and I'm using\n[6:47] basically systemd nspawn, which is kind\n[6:49] of like Docker.\n[6:51] We might have talked about this topic\n[6:53] before, but someone asked me again and\n[6:55] I'm almost like reluctant to answer this\n[6:57] question.\n[6:58] >> They're like, \"Oh, you if you set up\n[7:00] openclaw in your in your in your system\n[7:03] dnspawn, is it properly isolated?\"\n[7:06] Well, yes and no. Like I can I I mean,\n[7:09] as an administrator, I can I can, you\n[7:12] know, shell into each machine.\n[7:15] Um, you know, I always get questions\n[7:17] like, \"Oh, is it safe?\" And I'm like,\n[7:20] it's Docker, dude.\n[7:22] >> Right.\n[7:22] >> What can I say?\n[7:25] >> Yeah, this is the thing. Um,\n[7:27] >> Linux name spaces basically.\n[7:29] >> I read some two interesting related\n[7:31] quotes. One, one which is like if you're\n[7:34] not an engineer, like if you don't\n[7:36] understand the security implications of\n[7:38] open claw, you shouldn't be running open\n[7:39] claw. And then the other one which was\n[7:41] very very like similar. Um,\n[7:45] uh, it was two different comments on\n[7:47] LinkedIn. one of um on the Flux CD um\n[7:51] they they are actually they're using AI\n[7:54] heavily to to in in the project but then\n[7:56] he says he gets pull requests from\n[7:58] contributors and they generate um a\n[8:00] whole bunch of like tests and then he\n[8:02] says I didn't even look at it I just\n[8:04] asked my Opus instance to to review it\n[8:06] and then it it immediately poked holes\n[8:08] in like race conditions and all kinds of\n[8:10] other stuff and and and then another guy\n[8:13] who said if you don't if you can't write\n[8:16] the code itself then don't use an agent\n[8:19] to contribute it like and that's kind of\n[8:23] I don't know because I just contributed\n[8:25] a feature to a rust uh binary and I\n[8:27] didn't even know any anything about it\n[8:29] like I never written rust in my life um\n[8:31] but it passed all the tests uh and I did\n[8:34] the pull request and they accepted it so\n[8:38] um I think I think I don't know um I\n[8:41] think I agree with with the statement\n[8:43] that if you don't know how to at least\n[8:45] architect it Then don't\n[8:49] Yeah.\n[8:49] >> Well, go going back to the architecting\n[8:51] of of hosting open claw or some other\n[8:55] thing.\n[8:58] The thing is we're we're dealing with\n[9:00] the AI and it's it's not like a human\n[9:02] almost like for example here's a\n[9:05] scenario. It's it's a bit crazy but bear\n[9:08] with me. Say you have um\n[9:11] a Linux containers\n[9:13] and you and you set up a Linux container\n[9:16] with pseudo permissions because you need\n[9:19] pseudo permissions otherwise it can't\n[9:20] install things.\n[9:22] >> Mhm.\n[9:22] >> So you set up a Linux container it and\n[9:26] then you give AI a pseudo in that\n[9:28] container. You have your host access. It\n[9:32] doesn't have host access. It has Linux\n[9:34] container access only with pseudo\n[9:36] permissions. I can't help but feel that\n[9:39] an AI is probably strong enough\n[9:43] >> to escape\n[9:44] >> to escape. It will figure out a way and\n[9:47] like because Lin containers it's just\n[9:50] name spaces like it doesn't properly\n[9:53] protect you from resource contention or\n[9:56] something else. I feel\n[9:58] >> the most the most common way to escape a\n[10:02] con container is if you so basically you\n[10:07] have like the the engine or the demon\n[10:09] that controls the containers and that\n[10:11] demon is basically host level right so\n[10:14] it it can launch containers it can mount\n[10:16] volumes anything like that so the most\n[10:19] common is if you and that that socket\n[10:22] that that permission is root so sudo\n[10:25] >> so if you have a container that has\n[10:27] access to that socket through pseudo\n[10:31] then that container can 100% escape\n[10:33] right because the moment it can access\n[10:34] the socket it can send a command to the\n[10:36] demon hey spin up a container with the\n[10:38] root volume mounted uh with pseudo\n[10:40] access and now I have full sudo across\n[10:42] the whole host right\n[10:43] >> so you you think it will be able to\n[10:45] escape it will be\n[10:46] >> I mean I I I just mentioned that the\n[10:48] conditions are it has sudo access within\n[10:51] the container and it has access to the\n[10:53] socket so if that socket is mounted in\n[10:55] >> to me instinctively I think it's going\n[10:56] to be able to mount Mountain Escape. I\n[10:58] mean, one thing that was I found a bit\n[11:01] fascinating. So, I'm I use a Ubiquiti\n[11:05] Unifi networking inside my home and the\n[11:08] console. There's no CLI to it that only\n[11:11] has this like crazy web console. Maybe I\n[11:14] can show it.\n[11:16] >> The CLI of Oh, the console of of\n[11:18] OpenClow, you mean?\n[11:20] >> No, no. Uh, ubiquity.\n[11:21] >> Oh, the Oh, Ubiquity. Okay.\n[11:24] >> Yeah. So, um, oh no, just give me a\n[11:27] second.\n[11:31] >> Talking about like proprietary consoles\n[11:33] and things like that. There's a lot of\n[11:34] interesting stories coming up about that\n[11:36] as well, right? About like home\n[11:39] automation solutions that provide this\n[11:41] very restrictive remote and then it's\n[11:43] proprietary, but then people hook it\n[11:45] hook up cloud to the network interfaces\n[11:48] and it's able to basically figure out\n[11:50] how to control it without the the\n[11:52] proprietary console.\n[11:54] Maybe you can ask CL.\n[11:56] >> Well, I I'm going to get there. So, this\n[11:59] is my my home network. I have a CCTV. I\n[12:02] have network I have um\n[12:06] I have different I have I have different\n[12:08] VLANs. So, I put my I I put my Open Claw\n[12:12] on a different VLAN um with the hope\n[12:14] that it's pretty isolated from U. Is it\n[12:18] Yeah, this one. Uh how do I see my IPs?\n[12:23] These are my two open claws running\n[12:25] here.\n[12:26] >> Mhm.\n[12:27] >> Um\n[12:28] anyway, what I was trying to say here is\n[12:30] that I I had an issue here and the\n[12:32] trouble is there's no CLI. It's not like\n[12:34] microchick where you can SSH in. So\n[12:36] basically I was in open claw and it was\n[12:38] like taking screenshots\n[12:41] and uh and trying to figure out this. I\n[12:45] had this confusion because I have I have\n[12:47] my own subnet and there was some\n[12:48] confusion here. So I I click open claw\n[12:52] and I got it to do um to basically\n[12:54] configure the firewall as I needed but I\n[12:58] kept on hitting this error.\n[13:00] >> Wait, you you you just hovered over a\n[13:02] Chrome extension. That's cloud code, is\n[13:04] it?\n[13:05] >> Yeah, it is. Yeah.\n[13:06] >> Okay. Okay. So clicked cloud.\n[13:08] >> I clawed and I asked it to configure\n[13:09] stuff.\n[13:10] >> It it worked. But there was but but the\n[13:13] thing that was wild the thing that was\n[13:15] wild was that when it was entering a\n[13:18] form there was like an error like you\n[13:19] know like uh exception occurred or uh\n[13:22] you know error occurred but there was no\n[13:24] error message\n[13:25] >> and then what it did uh kind of shocked\n[13:28] me. It basically started this JavaScript\n[13:30] debugger. it started looking at the um\n[13:34] web RTC or something like you know the\n[13:37] the the thing and started debugging the\n[13:39] raw JSON messages going back and forth\n[13:42] and then it figured it out and I'm like\n[13:44] >> it does the same thing. Yeah.\n[13:46] >> I'm like holy moly like this is a game\n[13:49] changer. It could just figure it can\n[13:51] start using the network tab. I love that\n[13:54] because when I was working on my like my\n[13:56] Golang monor repo with the API server\n[13:58] and and a web app and a protobuff\n[14:00] generated TypeScript and then when\n[14:02] things didn't work the interface didn't\n[14:04] work it would very quickly like quickly\n[14:05] put a JavaScript snippet in the console\n[14:07] and basically look at like okay I'm\n[14:09] going to call this function of that's\n[14:10] available to the the web client and I'm\n[14:12] going to get this server response and it\n[14:14] has access to both right so it was like\n[14:16] querying the database working with the\n[14:18] you know the server side a API and it\n[14:20] was using the the client side TypeScript\n[14:22] identified like okay there's the SDK is\n[14:26] not mapping this API uh endpoint like\n[14:28] the field is in the API but it's not in\n[14:30] the SDK and it fixes it like it's really\n[14:33] really cool on monos and like across the\n[14:35] thing it does really cool stuff\n[14:37] >> yeah I mean it's incredible I mean I do\n[14:40] I do wish that uh UniFi had a CLI that\n[14:43] would make life a lot easier but yeah I\n[14:47] was I was\n[14:49] >> yeah so you build one blown away\n[14:50] >> cuz now you have now you cloud or opus\n[14:53] running inside the web client so it can\n[14:55] kind of build all a map of all of the\n[14:56] API calls available and then you can\n[14:58] build your own CLI and that's what some\n[15:01] guy did. So have you heard this story\n[15:03] about how a guy got access to 7,000 robo\n[15:06] vacums?\n[15:07] >> Oh yeah yeah that's a\n[15:09] >> or 70,000\n[15:11] >> it's a classic internet of things kind\n[15:12] of uh story right? Yeah, cuz internet of\n[15:15] things as people point out in the in the\n[15:18] hacken news comments that the the\n[15:20] software is usually always so bad\n[15:23] >> extremely bad like because these are\n[15:25] like hardware manufacturers printers on\n[15:27] the network.\n[15:28] >> This is DJI. I mean I don't want to\n[15:29] throw\n[15:30] >> Yeah, it was it was a drone. I don't\n[15:32] know. I expect better from DJI, but I\n[15:34] think DJI has lots of like what do you\n[15:36] call it? Subsidiaries and\n[15:37] >> it was an auto vacum thing and he wanted\n[15:40] to control his vacum\n[15:43] >> the same way that he can control a\n[15:45] drone.\n[15:46] >> Yeah, vacuum.\n[15:47] >> What do you say? What is it? How do you\n[15:48] Is this Belgian\n[15:50] >> vacuum?\n[15:50] >> It is non-native vacuum.\n[15:53] >> What do you call a hoover in Flemish?\n[15:56] Uh,\n[15:58] it would be something that sucks\n[16:00] >> sucker.\n[16:01] >> Yeah, sucker.\n[16:05] >> Oh, you you should speak your South\n[16:07] African. Stop sec.\n[16:11] >> Okay.\n[16:11] >> Must be similar word in South in\n[16:13] Africans. Maybe not in\n[16:16] >> I wanted to talk about um so maybe just\n[16:19] changing the the topic ever so slightly.\n[16:22] Ever so slightly.\n[16:24] Um,\n[16:25] >> you're multipiting now.\n[16:28] >> Well, okay. There's a couple of things I\n[16:29] want to talk about,\n[16:31] but maybe it's it's worth I mean, since\n[16:35] you're more into into specs and things\n[16:37] like this, the thought that I had in my\n[16:39] mind, and you you're welcome to to cut\n[16:42] it down\n[16:44] was uh you know, I'm I'm working on uh\n[16:47] on cards or features in my workplace\n[16:52] and uh we discussed before that like\n[16:54] ideally the intent is clear with your\n[16:57] with your teammates, right? Like what\n[16:59] what is the prompt you're using to get\n[17:01] where you want to go and things like\n[17:03] this. Um and I can't help but I think\n[17:05] that is pretty much specdriven\n[17:08] development in a way because like what I\n[17:11] want is a way of capturing\n[17:14] the prompt that was used to produce this\n[17:17] artifact. And the trouble is right now\n[17:20] we don't have a framework for doing\n[17:21] that. Like it's up to someone to\n[17:23] basically copy and paste. I mean\n[17:26] advanced users use um what's it called\n[17:29] that uh Simon Mullison uh program to\n[17:32] maybe share the session.\n[17:33] >> Yeah. Right.\n[17:34] >> That's that's usually just too noisy.\n[17:36] The\n[17:37] >> the the the whole the whole uh act of\n[17:43] using AI\n[17:45] is in my opinion\n[17:48] what spec what a spectrum development\n[17:51] needs to be. it I it just needs to be a\n[17:54] way of of sharing a prompt and um and\n[17:59] almost reproducing what someone else has\n[18:02] done like given this prompt can I\n[18:05] reproduce what what what this person has\n[18:08] been doing and that to me is spec kit uh\n[18:12] driven development it's like sharing a\n[18:14] prompt kind of reproducing what the what\n[18:16] the stuff has been done\n[18:18] >> yeah absolutely yeah\n[18:20] so um\n[18:21] >> it's it's Like I feel like a lot of the\n[18:23] despect driven um frameworks seem to\n[18:28] differentiate themselves by you know\n[18:30] what questions they ask or how they\n[18:32] structure things but like for me I just\n[18:36] need the prompt recorded\n[18:39] uh and and shared\n[18:42] >> yes I mean specri development is not\n[18:45] just about like a single prompt that\n[18:46] generates the code right I mean it's\n[18:49] really about the alignment across\n[18:51] multiple like parties around the user\n[18:54] stories first\n[18:55] >> and then from those user stories you you\n[18:57] you basically distill a technical uh\n[19:01] document, right? And and then from that\n[19:04] document then you have finally\n[19:05] >> why do you need why do you even need\n[19:06] this technical document almost? Surely\n[19:10] the the the prompt the raw prompt to AI\n[19:14] is all you need in a way\n[19:18] or is it just about\n[19:20] >> yeah know the the idea of of of\n[19:22] specdriven development is removing\n[19:26] assumptions making everything that's\n[19:28] implicit explicit um because when you\n[19:30] give a prompt to an AI statistically\n[19:33] it's going to generate a whole bunch of\n[19:35] like it's going to have a whole bunch of\n[19:36] assumptions right I mean even the models\n[19:38] now from a from Antropic, they have a\n[19:40] whole bunch of constraints.\n[19:42] >> But that can work both ways though. Like\n[19:44] you could you could potentially be\n[19:46] limiting yourself by by constraining.\n[19:50] >> Yeah. But that limiting should happen\n[19:51] out in the open. You should have a\n[19:53] discussion about it. It shouldn't be\n[19:54] some because I think that's the problem\n[19:55] with the prompt. The prompt has a lot of\n[19:57] assumptions in it. And I think uh uh the\n[20:01] users like the the high level um\n[20:03] description of the feature that you want\n[20:06] does not um include like includes a lot\n[20:10] of implicit like assumptions and\n[20:12] unclarities and and it it can generate\n[20:14] so much uh divergence like is this in\n[20:17] scope is that is it out of scope you\n[20:18] need to identify that definitely\n[20:20] >> yeah but but the you're right though I\n[20:24] feel like there's a there's a bit of a\n[20:27] there's a bit of Uh\n[20:31] how do you say this? Contention.\n[20:34] Uh there's no there's a bit of a there's\n[20:37] there's there's two camps of thought\n[20:39] here, right? That you do like uh the\n[20:42] upfront sort of planning where you sort\n[20:44] of like generate a spec\n[20:48] generate spec\n[20:51] and and and then you you have your uh I\n[20:54] don't know your your prompting\n[20:58] But the I don't you think the other way\n[21:00] around is also can lead to the same the\n[21:05] same results or if not better sometimes\n[21:08] like you know\n[21:11] you this is what I'm trying to let the\n[21:13] AI drive I think that's one of the clear\n[21:16] um when I talk to my friend when how\n[21:19] they implement uh AI in their AI enable\n[21:22] as an AI enablement team across an\n[21:24] organization is that they firmly put I\n[21:28] mean they split it in two stages the\n[21:30] planning or the the ideating and the and\n[21:33] the implementation and they say very\n[21:36] clearly the a the human is resp drives\n[21:40] the ideas and and and the alignment and\n[21:43] the AI controls the code drives the code\n[21:46] and and the implementation and between\n[21:48] them you have your validation if you say\n[21:52] the the intent is vague\n[21:55] Um you change I mean you put clarifying\n[21:58] questions in now but I I\n[22:01] mean you need to cap the intent alone is\n[22:04] not not the implementation like your\n[22:05] clarifying questions are part of what\n[22:07] you need to capture before you come to\n[22:09] >> so what what I'm trying to say here is\n[22:10] that like I think this the option below\n[22:14] here\n[22:16] is what a lot of people are using and it\n[22:19] and it goes quite well. Um, sorry.\n[22:23] Let me just flush this out so it's a\n[22:25] it's kind of easier to understand\n[22:28] because the other way around is like is\n[22:32] more like waterfall, right? The top one\n[22:33] is more like waterfall where you kind of\n[22:35] like define break it down in in a lot of\n[22:38] detail.\n[22:39] >> Yeah.\n[22:40] And then you and and you've broken it\n[22:42] down so much that like maybe I mean\n[22:45] maybe it's actually a really good way of\n[22:47] working with some models because model\n[22:48] some models as we know have are only\n[22:52] effective with with a limited amount of\n[22:54] context and and they do really great but\n[22:56] as as AI's as AI models mature or\n[23:00] whatever the expression is we we can get\n[23:02] to we can get the the the below option I\n[23:06] don't know what we're going to\n[23:06] >> so the below option seems more like what\n[23:08] you do in a single session in in cloud\n[23:09] code, right?\n[23:10] >> Exactly. But maybe I don't want to call\n[23:12] it vibe, but it's more on a vibe,\n[23:14] >> but that's also because cloud code\n[23:15] currently doesn't really have a good\n[23:16] mechanism to like do longer lift um like\n[23:20] implementation. I find with the below, I\n[23:23] would maybe you iterate faster, but you\n[23:26] do a lot more refactoring because you\n[23:28] don't really get what you want. With the\n[23:30] above, you really lay the foundation.\n[23:33] >> Yeah. Yeah. And I think you do a lot\n[23:35] less refactoring because you've you've\n[23:37] aligned in terms of like architectural\n[23:39] layers and and technology and and so you\n[23:42] you can build upon I think the one below\n[23:44] works when well for oneoff and the one\n[23:46] be above works well for you do it and\n[23:49] then you maintain it and then you evolve\n[23:50] it.\n[23:52] >> Yeah. The the the trouble is is that um\n[23:56] like I tell I tell you the one below if\n[23:58] you do that with cloud code he's just\n[24:00] going to go for the minimal. He's always\n[24:02] going to go for the minimal. Yeah,\n[24:03] >> he's always going to avoid like\n[24:04] refactoring. He's always going to say\n[24:06] like we could spend like an extra two\n[24:08] sessions on fixing this up or we could\n[24:10] do the absolute minimum and change this\n[24:12] and this and it would be fine. But then\n[24:13] it's like then you are left with you\n[24:16] know further down the line more and more\n[24:17] of a mess. Um and and and it becomes\n[24:20] really hard to to evolve it. Um yeah, I\n[24:24] think it's really about um a lightweight\n[24:28] driven approach and I don't know I\n[24:30] haven't watched the um the talk of Peter\n[24:32] Steinburgger where he's maybe this is\n[24:34] more aligned with this lightweight\n[24:36] approach uh and as you give more\n[24:38] responsibility over the model um maybe\n[24:41] that's fine as the models become more\n[24:43] capable. I actually saw some interesting\n[24:46] take on on on someone about I use AI but\n[24:50] um when AI is down or I don't have\n[24:52] access to AI I still need to maintain\n[24:54] the system then what let's say that all\n[24:56] of the code is generated by by AI and I\n[24:58] have no control then what am I left with\n[25:03] >> well\n[25:04] just to just to play devil's advocate a\n[25:06] little bit here because I feel with a\n[25:08] lot of spec driven I mean just just\n[25:10] prove me wrong just to tell me I'm wrong\n[25:12] here is that they generate the spec and\n[25:16] then the spec is sort of like checked in\n[25:18] checked into uh git or something and\n[25:21] then that that that spec becomes\n[25:24] um for one of a word quite solid right\n[25:27] it doesn't it doesn't uh it's not up for\n[25:31] for for any drastic changes so so\n[25:34] basically\n[25:36] what I'm trying to say here is that\n[25:39] is that\n[25:42] that's not great because You you kind of\n[25:44] want to regenerate the spec, don't you,\n[25:46] from the user stories.\n[25:49] >> Yeah, you're conflating the spec is the\n[25:51] user stories. Maybe you're talking about\n[25:53] the Okay, so in specit you have spec\n[25:55] which is user stories and functional\n[25:57] requirements and then you you get the\n[26:01] you finalize those you write you capture\n[26:02] the user stories, right? As a user, as a\n[26:05] developer, I want this. As a as a\n[26:08] reviewer, I want this. And then and then\n[26:10] the other one is the plan which is the\n[26:12] technical implementation of those specs\n[26:14] like okay um our our framework uses\n[26:17] superbase we have rest uh endpoints\n[26:20] provided by superbase we use edge\n[26:22] functions this is our technical\n[26:23] implementation we deploy using file\n[26:25] using nextjs or we deploy uh onto AWS\n[26:29] with um you know um serverless lambda\n[26:32] and API gateway and all that um that's\n[26:34] the technical plan like what is my my\n[26:36] infrastructure like what is my framework\n[26:38] like do I use next do I use vit do I use\n[26:41] this or that is it golang\n[26:44] that's where you you put the technical\n[26:46] details\n[26:48] >> okay\n[26:48] >> so this you generate spec you can drop\n[26:51] that because user stories is the spec\n[26:54] you get user stories technical plan and\n[26:56] then you have uh task breakdown and task\n[26:59] breakdown is well suited for smaller\n[27:01] models I smaller context\n[27:05] >> I guess what I'm striking at is that\n[27:11] uh the the last specket thing I was\n[27:14] playing with was the uh oh my god what\n[27:16] is the Google one called there's so many\n[27:18] >> conductor\n[27:19] >> yeah it's the last one is conductor I\n[27:21] just I just thought there was just a lot\n[27:23] of\n[27:25] artifacts there is what I'm trying to\n[27:27] say there was it's like maybe\n[27:32] the best way to call this is is quite\n[27:34] structured but and and and it's fine\n[27:37] really it's kind It's kind of fine. I\n[27:39] guess what what what I'm trying to say\n[27:42] in a very awkward way is that\n[27:46] I want uh the lightweight approach, but\n[27:50] I want the lightweight approach more in\n[27:52] a in a teambased way too. Like I want it\n[27:57] I want it so that that every time\n[27:59] someone starts working on a card that\n[28:02] the prompt is exposed for that\n[28:04] particular PR\n[28:06] >> and uh and those clarifying questions\n[28:09] down the line are captured\n[28:11] >> and and and that's it. I mean yeah we\n[28:13] can have both right\n[28:15] >> uh yeah so so in the product that I'm\n[28:18] building we have the idea of playbooks\n[28:20] and a playbook would basically be the\n[28:23] way that we define a lightweight one. um\n[28:25] where we have a lot less steps um and\n[28:28] and a playbook is boot is basically a\n[28:30] template for your repository or your set\n[28:33] of repositories to how do you bootstrap\n[28:35] them. So in our specit playbook it means\n[28:38] it has all four stages. It has this, you\n[28:40] know, user story generation with the\n[28:42] specify. It has the technical\n[28:44] requirements and spikes on technical\n[28:47] research of the libraries that you're\n[28:48] looking at and then selecting deciding\n[28:51] why you want to use this library and why\n[28:53] that library didn't fit. Why you're not\n[28:54] going with cloud formation but you're\n[28:56] going with CDKTF for example. Those are\n[28:58] all spikes that are part of the plan.\n[29:00] And then finally the tickets that get\n[29:02] generated are from the um you know the\n[29:04] task generation based on the plan on the\n[29:06] aligned plan and part of the the plan is\n[29:08] a whole bunch of decision records like\n[29:10] we did a spike and this is decision. We\n[29:12] did a spike like I for example I asked\n[29:14] Opus look at terra constructs and its\n[29:16] coverage based on what I need in AWS\n[29:18] infrastructure. Do I have sufficient L2\n[29:20] components that can cover this or should\n[29:22] I go for AWS CDK?\n[29:23] >> I'm glad records. So would you say\n[29:26] decision records is very much part of\n[29:27] the spec kit? Um\n[29:30] >> well we do it in in in my framework. Um\n[29:32] so I'm not sure if decision because I I\n[29:35] don't know where it comes from but Opus\n[29:37] starts writing down decision record and\n[29:38] then when it it does something it says\n[29:40] refer to D15 and D1 which is decision\n[29:42] one and D15. It's like what? Uh yeah,\n[29:44] sure. I guess I trust\n[29:47] >> because I can't in the lightweight\n[29:49] approach. It's not to say that we can't\n[29:51] incorporate uh like an agents.md or\n[29:55] whatever and decision records to get to\n[29:58] get where we want to get to is I wanted\n[30:00] I wanted to\n[30:01] >> Yeah. Yeah. I think you can uh if you if\n[30:03] on the platform that I'm building you\n[30:05] decide to create a playbook with a lot\n[30:06] less um steps in between uh then you I\n[30:11] think one of the quickest way to do it\n[30:13] is if you run cloud code apparently you\n[30:15] can set a flag where it writes the plan\n[30:17] because when you go into a plan mode\n[30:19] with cloud it creates a plan file and it\n[30:21] currently lives somewhere uh like based\n[30:23] on your pro on your session ID actually\n[30:26] uh and then it you don't have that part\n[30:28] of your git right so you can actually\n[30:30] run cloud code and say, \"Hey, whatever\n[30:32] plan files we create, include it into\n[30:34] this directly.\" Plans and then you can\n[30:36] include it in your PR.\n[30:37] >> Yeah. The the the plan. Yeah. I've\n[30:40] noticed that all the agents or what what\n[30:44] do you call uh Claude and C-Pilot and\n[30:47] and these things like what is the what\n[30:49] do you call\n[30:49] >> those are like agent shells like they\n[30:52] are like shells for the models and with\n[30:54] aic features. So\n[30:55] >> yeah. Oh yeah. All all the agent shells\n[30:58] have some sort of way of writing out a a\n[31:00] plan,\n[31:01] >> but I'm never too sure if it's actually\n[31:03] bringing in the plan into the current\n[31:05] prompt. You know what I mean?\n[31:07] >> Uh but maybe\n[31:09] >> with cloud code is very funny. I don't\n[31:10] like it creates the plan as a markdown\n[31:12] somewhere on a separate directory\n[31:13] outside plan or something.\n[31:15] >> Yeah. And then it gives you the option\n[31:17] to like clear the session and start the\n[31:19] implementation. And if I have I like now\n[31:22] that I I have my\n[31:23] >> it's not but it's still super clear if\n[31:24] it's even using the plan. Uh you know\n[31:28] you know 10 10 clarifying question chats\n[31:30] down.\n[31:31] >> So some people are really upset because\n[31:32] you basically go into plan mode and it\n[31:35] goes and explore the code and it then it\n[31:36] creates a plan based on your\n[31:38] requirements and then it writes down\n[31:40] we're going to create this and that and\n[31:41] then you it if you do clear\n[31:44] >> it clears the whole context. You start\n[31:46] from scratch with a clear plan and then\n[31:48] what what does it do? It goes and read\n[31:50] all the code. It goes and does\n[31:52] everything again. And so people are\n[31:53] like, why? Like this is such a huge\n[31:55] waste of my money because I have a\n[31:57] limited amount of tokens and I just, you\n[31:59] know, you have the whole repo.\n[32:00] >> I've seen that sort of behavior. I've\n[32:02] seen that.\n[32:03] >> But the worst part is if you're at like\n[32:05] like 60 or 70% context usage after the\n[32:09] plan, there's absolutely no way in hell\n[32:11] that you're just going to keep that\n[32:12] context and keep going because that's\n[32:14] it, right? After two turns, it's dead.\n[32:17] It's completely hallucinating. it loses.\n[32:19] >> So that's one big difference I found\n[32:21] with using codeex 5.3 is that the\n[32:24] context seems to be a lot better\n[32:26] managed. Like you don't have to you\n[32:28] don't have to manage yourself. Yeah.\n[32:31] >> So anyway, I haven't I basically talk\n[32:34] about these differences because I can't\n[32:35] help but think\n[32:38] >> things are changing so so much that\n[32:42] >> you feel like something like specitate\n[32:44] will be outdated very quickly. Well, no.\n[32:45] I would say I I would say anything too\n[32:48] structured.\n[32:49] >> Yeah.\n[32:50] >> Is going to be outdated like because\n[32:52] because everything's changing so quickly\n[32:53] like and and yeah, like uh I'm sure you\n[32:56] saw all that ste that the the latest the\n[32:59] latest hoo-ha like don't do slash in it.\n[33:02] Don't set up an agents.md don't set\n[33:05] because the because these things u have\n[33:08] been shown to like\n[33:09] >> assume your context.\n[33:10] >> Yeah. To to mess up your your session.\n[33:12] So,\n[33:13] >> and they can get outdated as well,\n[33:14] right?\n[33:15] >> Yeah. So, even even me like I would I\n[33:18] would maybe if I was talking to someone\n[33:20] about lightweight ways of doing it, I\n[33:22] would say set up a claw.md to to set the\n[33:25] scene or something like that after a\n[33:27] while that this that might be um\n[33:29] outdated.\n[33:30] >> Yeah, I've definitely seen cloud.md\n[33:33] getting so outdated like or read me like\n[33:35] I just finished the whole thing. I did\n[33:37] the speckit and I created a bunch of\n[33:39] spikes then generated all the task then\n[33:41] I run several op several sessions to\n[33:44] complete those tasks those\n[33:45] implementations and then everything is\n[33:48] done and everything looks good and and\n[33:50] then when I look at the merge PR and I\n[33:52] go to the read me it's like wait none of\n[33:54] that has been reflected in the readme\n[33:55] like what\n[33:58] it's all living it's all live code and I\n[34:00] was like how did how does that miss like\n[34:02] why is there why didn't I not have any\n[34:04] task to update the read me that I have\n[34:05] to do another you go and update like\n[34:07] read the code again and I'll update the\n[34:09] read me.\n[34:10] >> The the thing that I really struggle\n[34:12] with and I think it's funny how when we\n[34:15] started this podcast we were chatting\n[34:17] about beads and using BD ready and and\n[34:20] that was actually a really good flow\n[34:22] because because I'm just extolling this\n[34:25] lightweight approach.\n[34:27] Uh, oh, sorry. I was basically I was\n[34:31] basically I was working with Copilot\n[34:34] doing my lightweight sort of approach\n[34:35] where I just have a prompt and I just go\n[34:38] for it.\n[34:40] I don't want to call it vibe coding, but\n[34:42] but the trouble is when I was at least\n[34:45] working with co-pilot, I kept on like\n[34:48] hitting these problems where it was\n[34:49] like, oh, do you want to continue to\n[34:51] iterate?\n[34:53] Um, and then I hit this thing with the\n[34:55] max requests. Like, I just want it to go\n[34:59] until you're done. Don't ask me whether\n[35:02] to continue or not. So, these are these\n[35:06] are the my real pain points. I I feel\n[35:08] like I solved I solved them ages ago\n[35:10] with with beads in a way because\n[35:13] >> No, actually, did I solve them? No, I\n[35:15] don't think I I really did.\n[35:18] >> Like, have you solved Yeah. A question\n[35:20] to you, Vincent. Have you solved the\n[35:22] sort of like here's some work just go\n[35:25] and do it\n[35:25] >> until you're done\n[35:26] >> and do it until you're done? I don't\n[35:28] think I've\n[35:29] >> I find cloud code is doing like keeps\n[35:32] going until but it goes into it it goes\n[35:34] into a loop like it goes insane like I\n[35:37] was doing\n[35:38] >> this is the Ralph Wigim loop this is\n[35:39] this this is the innovation isn't it\n[35:41] just keep on going till\n[35:42] >> yeah but like it makes one change cuz\n[35:44] for example I was troubleshooting a\n[35:46] GitHub work uh GitHub app web hook and\n[35:50] um oh no it was worse it had the\n[35:54] function URL um in front of a lambda so\n[35:57] The GitHub app web hook is actually a\n[35:59] function URL that invokes the lambda and\n[36:00] the lambda runs and does the thing and\n[36:02] the lambda um kept getting a a\n[36:04] permission issue and I was trying to\n[36:05] troubleshoot where the problem was. It\n[36:07] was in a terapform configuration\n[36:08] somewhere. Apparently a Lambda\n[36:09] permission was missing, but it went into\n[36:11] a red herring because there was some\n[36:13] forum posts that I found that talks\n[36:16] about um some AWS at some point making a\n[36:19] change to the function URL requiring a\n[36:23] different a different attribute set uh\n[36:25] which was like public. Anyway, to get to\n[36:28] the point, um, the Opus was working with\n[36:32] me to try and find the issue and then\n[36:34] went redheading and then I asked like,\n[36:36] \"Can we try this one?\" And because you\n[36:37] know how it is with troubleshooting,\n[36:38] right? You try one thing, you test it,\n[36:40] doesn't work, you try another thing. Did\n[36:42] you change too many things, then you\n[36:43] don't know what fixed it, right? So, it\n[36:45] went into this loop. Let me just change\n[36:46] one more thing. Okay, let me just test\n[36:48] it one once again. And it went into this\n[36:50] like did it four or five times or was it\n[36:51] enough? I'm pretty sure we covered it.\n[36:53] I'm pretty sure that we we we did\n[36:55] establish that that was the fix.\n[36:57] >> Yeah. Like during that isolation when\n[37:00] you're developing stuff, uh do you do\n[37:02] you actually use git work trees and\n[37:04] things like this? Because what I what\n[37:05] did I ended up doing at work was I ended\n[37:08] up creating new code spaces, new dev\n[37:10] containers to basically try different\n[37:12] things because otherwise I was fearful\n[37:16] that the session would would uh\n[37:20] interfere with another session if you\n[37:21] know what I mean.\n[37:23] So I I don't currently have a workflow\n[37:26] where I spin up multiple\n[37:29] you know features that I'm working on\n[37:30] across different work trees but I did\n[37:33] you I did ask sometimes um or see cloud\n[37:38] go ahead and say like oh let me just\n[37:39] quickly check out main branch into a\n[37:42] work tree for me to like compare and fix\n[37:45] some things like and and do a quick\n[37:47] exploration. So I I love it uh when it\n[37:49] goes and and and takes a branch into a\n[37:51] work tree and then explores things and\n[37:52] then takes things back and like um so\n[37:55] it's using\n[37:55] >> so so it was doing it but you don't you\n[37:58] you didn't I mean you didn't expressly\n[38:01] >> no I don't think I did\n[38:02] >> uh I don't think I think I mentioned\n[38:04] just like hey can we make sure that this\n[38:05] these two branches now are aligned on\n[38:07] these things and it just went and\n[38:10] created a little x uh a little check out\n[38:13] of of\n[38:15] >> going back to this this this lightweight\n[38:17] diagram here.\n[38:20] I can't help but think, and you can you\n[38:23] can tell me I'm going crazy here, that\n[38:29] the easiest way to see a big change in\n[38:31] the future with quality and um\n[38:35] and differentiation and I don't know how\n[38:38] you want to call it,\n[38:40] but the the biggest the biggest given\n[38:43] given a prompt\n[38:46] why why lightweight is appealing to me\n[38:48] is cuz like I've been messing around\n[38:49] with Claude up until a few days ago and\n[38:53] I've been pretty happy with the\n[38:55] breakthrough of Claude 4.5 in the last\n[38:58] few months. It's been amazing.\n[39:00] >> But then uh or 4.6, yeah, whatever. Uh 4\n[39:05] something. Uh\n[39:08] what I'm trying to say here is that um\n[39:11] I've given codeex 5.3 largely prompted\n[39:14] by Peter Steinberger a try and I'm\n[39:17] impressed. I'm impressed. So basically\n[39:19] he here's here is uh Claude sonet 4.6 or\n[39:22] Opus 4.6\n[39:24] You know, here's Claude, the red one,\n[39:26] and here's Opic, and here's uh Codeex,\n[39:29] sorry. Um, the green one. I basically,\n[39:34] maybe I'm going crazy, Vincent. I want\n[39:36] to essentially regenerate the same\n[39:40] prompts that I've done for previous work\n[39:42] in the past\n[39:43] >> with with codeex just to see\n[39:46] >> what the final artifact is going to be\n[39:49] and how it differs. And this is this is\n[39:52] where I am with my thinking. I just want\n[39:55] to try different models now. Um\n[39:59] just to see what what this comes up\n[40:02] with. And I feel like\n[40:05] um\n[40:07] maybe maybe you'll have I'm just\n[40:09] wondering here. Will will\n[40:11] >> will you have\n[40:14] to do that? Well, well, the the trouble\n[40:15] is is that you're using you're using um\n[40:19] you're using something to do the spec\n[40:21] kit, right? And you and you're using\n[40:23] you're using another, you know, you're\n[40:25] break you have a few stages here, stage\n[40:28] one, stage two or something like that.\n[40:30] And I feel like the fact that you have\n[40:34] different stages\n[40:35] >> allows me to replay them with different\n[40:36] models. Yes.\n[40:37] >> It means that it's going to be harder to\n[40:39] replay them.\n[40:40] >> No. No. The opposite. you think\n[40:43] >> because yeah it's it's not like I am not\n[40:46] attached to the cloud u plan mo planning\n[40:49] mode I actually never run cloud planning\n[40:52] mode running cloud I I get very\n[40:54] frustrated like I I did it for a while\n[40:56] like okay I went like this I I went\n[40:59] cloud plan is amazing speckit is way\n[41:01] better never run plan again then they\n[41:04] did a whole bunch of improvements on the\n[41:05] plan right they made it write the the\n[41:07] the plan out they made it make task\n[41:09] dependencies and then I did a couple of\n[41:10] sessions where I just fcoded like why\n[41:12] would I spend all this time setting up\n[41:13] speckit for some other project when I\n[41:15] don't have it. I can just try and do\n[41:16] cloud code pan and that's it.\n[41:18] >> And now I'm back to the speckit flow and\n[41:21] I'm back to the like I'm never doing\n[41:23] plan again. I'm I'm I'm I'm having my\n[41:26] structured flow and the shell is just\n[41:29] like here like\n[41:31] >> it's not a feature of the shell which\n[41:33] stage I'm in. So I can take any stage\n[41:35] and put it in any shell and execute it.\n[41:38] M okay.\n[41:39] >> So that means I can repeat I can repeat\n[41:42] I can take the stage from here and then\n[41:44] repeat the implementation from there. Um\n[41:47] because I'm not\n[41:48] >> I mean this is a bold claim here\n[41:49] Vincent. Like I I want to believe you\n[41:53] that you're you can get a more\n[41:54] reproducible thing here. But do you\n[41:56] actually test test that?\n[41:59] >> I think yes. I I did a couple of times\n[42:01] where I went and let it build and then\n[42:03] realize that it was wrong and then just\n[42:05] uh just undo like locally undo all the\n[42:08] changes and then basically get reset and\n[42:11] then just make an adjustment and kick it\n[42:13] off again. I did it at least once or\n[42:15] twice. You can't say I never did it.\n[42:18] >> Um\n[42:20] yeah, I guess that's the key for me. Is\n[42:22] it reproducible?\n[42:24] >> It would be more reproducible if I would\n[42:26] use trees from one structure to the\n[42:28] next. Right. If I would go, I'm at this\n[42:30] point and now spin up three different\n[42:31] ways.\n[42:32] >> I guess I I'm I'm like an AI maximalist\n[42:35] at this point where I'm like, you know,\n[42:37] I I need to just basically whenever the\n[42:39] new model comes out, whatever that's\n[42:41] called,\n[42:42] >> you want to benchmark.\n[42:44] >> You want to have your own benchmark. I I\n[42:46] don't really I mean I don't think\n[42:51] like the benchmark is me looking at the\n[42:55] artifact and going hm that's an\n[42:56] interesting way of solving the problem.\n[42:59] Like I don't think my benchmark is is a\n[43:03] is like a\n[43:07] is something I can can almost\n[43:12] define, right? I I basically Yeah. I\n[43:16] want to stop saying basically. I I I I\n[43:20] want to be pleasantly surprised by what\n[43:23] the the what uh new models can do.\n[43:28] Already I am impressed that Codeex 5.3\n[43:33] is comparable to Claude, which is great\n[43:35] because we need competition. Competition\n[43:36] is great. Thank the Lord that we have\n[43:40] codeex 5.3 which is very comparable to\n[43:43] to opus 4.6 but they're different. They\n[43:46] are different.\n[43:49] >> In the in the project I'm working on\n[43:51] where we use specit uh prompts, we have\n[43:55] me and another guy using codeex, sorry,\n[43:58] using cloud code with opus and then one\n[44:01] guy using GLM and we're working off the\n[44:04] same specs and he's doing everything\n[44:06] with GLM\n[44:07] >> GLM.\n[44:08] >> It's like Z AI. I think it's uh it's\n[44:10] like 20 25% of the cost. It's one of the\n[44:12] one uh the providers being accused by\n[44:15] Entropic for mass exploitation and and\n[44:17] and have you seen this like\n[44:20] exfiltration?\n[44:22] >> Yeah, I'm\n[44:24] Yeah. Well, who's to say anyone's wrong?\n[44:26] But like this is I'm just trying to\n[44:29] explain to you Vincent this is this is\n[44:31] the camp I'm in right now. Just being\n[44:33] pleasantly surprised because this I feel\n[44:35] like\n[44:36] >> having the lightweight approach gives me\n[44:38] more\n[44:39] >> Yes.\n[44:41] for a hobby project.\n[44:43] >> Single player hobby project. Go ahead.\n[44:48] >> You just said yourself. I I have no way\n[44:50] of replicating it or sharing it or\n[44:51] having other people work with on on it.\n[44:54] >> Yeah, you're right. Yeah.\n[44:57] Yeah.\n[45:00] Okay. I think we we covered that topic\n[45:02] pretty well.\n[45:04] >> I mean, I agree with you that whatever\n[45:07] because this was a funny thing. Um, I\n[45:10] think Claude made an announcement on\n[45:11] Reddit and then always in the comments\n[45:14] is like, haha, all of these people\n[45:16] building their own structured whatever\n[45:18] thing all just replaced within one go by\n[45:21] one release of cloud code, right? And\n[45:22] we're going to keep seeing that, right?\n[45:24] This whole the whole memory system\n[45:25] thing, everyone builds one and people go\n[45:27] like, oh, you know, cloud Antropica made\n[45:30] a feature and it's gone.\n[45:31] >> Um, all that effort. I think even with\n[45:34] what I'm doing with the whole speckit\n[45:36] thing,\n[45:37] I also think one day it's going to be\n[45:39] like, okay, we just released team- based\n[45:41] uh spec uh system on cloud code just\n[45:45] like what they did. Oh yeah, I remember\n[45:47] where which where which one I saw just\n[45:48] today which was cloud code announced\n[45:51] remote like you can run cloud code in\n[45:53] like a a certain mode. So if you put it\n[45:55] on your laptop and you keep it connected\n[45:57] then you can go on your phone and you\n[45:59] can go into the app and basically\n[46:01] connect to your laptop. This is what I\n[46:02] was striking to through for that whole\n[46:04] like getting AI running\n[46:08] in a Ralph Wigan loop or something.\n[46:10] These quality of life things where you\n[46:12] where it's on your mobile and then it\n[46:14] like it says when it's done or something\n[46:16] like this. These what do we call them\n[46:19] agentic shells. Th this is this is where\n[46:24] I feel specit spec driven development\n[46:27] needs to go. it needs to to go in the\n[46:30] way of of realizing all those quality of\n[46:34] life features\n[46:36] >> but also for an organization to adopt\n[46:37] this I think there's two aspects of the\n[46:40] problem one is code generation and two\n[46:44] is requirement definition and mainten\n[46:47] like management right so you have your\n[46:48] confluence you have your Jira you do\n[46:50] your your your uh designs you create\n[46:52] your tickets and then you have the other\n[46:54] side which is we have the engineers\n[46:56] implementing so there's a lot of people\n[46:58] creating agent swarms. There was just\n[47:00] two articles like Stripe has one where\n[47:02] they're like end to end codegen on our\n[47:04] on our projects. There's one from I\n[47:06] forgot the company now Dexter or\n[47:08] something and they they say we build\n[47:10] Swarm and no we're not making it open\n[47:12] source but just point your agent at this\n[47:14] document and it will generate your own\n[47:15] version of it because it has all the\n[47:16] details on how to build it. Swarm is\n[47:18] basically a\n[47:19] >> well swarm likewarm likewarm\n[47:22] >> an agent\n[47:23] >> swarm and yeah but like like again I\n[47:25] think there's both these problems are\n[47:28] all being solved by organizations in\n[47:31] privately on their own ways every\n[47:32] organization is building their own agent\n[47:35] or orchestration like agent uh swarming\n[47:38] or orchestration framework you give it\n[47:40] you connect it to your they say we use\n[47:42] we use linear linear so they create\n[47:44] their tickets and then the agents work\n[47:46] on them and then they review\n[47:48] >> and then the other ones.\n[47:49] >> Yeah. So they're they're all going to\n[47:50] like on one side you have the execution\n[47:52] site needs to connect to your Confluence\n[47:54] and Jira or your linear and in my case I\n[47:56] don't want confidence Jira or linear. I\n[47:58] just connect everything to my git repo\n[48:00] and that's\n[48:01] >> yeah there's definitely like an like an\n[48:02] arms race. A lot of people are talking\n[48:04] about this but yeah it just I just want\n[48:06] to pair it down.\n[48:08] >> I just my my requirements are simple. I\n[48:12] just want the prompt to be recorded\n[48:17] and some and some maybe some quality of\n[48:20] life things where where where that\n[48:22] prompt gets run until it's done or\n[48:26] something like that and yeah and like no\n[48:29] clicking continue and max and and\n[48:33] worrying about max request like how many\n[48:36] companies are are basically there should\n[48:40] be\n[48:41] a Steve Jger phase, you know, tier one,\n[48:43] tier two of of company adoption. Like\n[48:46] there's so many companies that on stage\n[48:49] one where they just have a chat window\n[48:51] and then there's so many companies who\n[48:53] who don't have uh you know max plans or\n[48:56] or things like this. So basically\n[48:58] engineers are are basically like oh I\n[49:02] can't do this thing because I'm run out\n[49:04] of the context and they're like banging\n[49:06] their head because they can't get\n[49:07] anywhere or they can't experiment.\n[49:11] Um and then the then there's companies\n[49:13] that where we're where probably there's\n[49:15] so many engineers in a way this is kind\n[49:17] of describes me in a way who are\n[49:19] basically doing their thing but since\n[49:22] for one political reason or another um\n[49:26] >> it's not officially\n[49:28] >> it's not official. So basically I I\n[49:29] don't have a I don't have a like a\n[49:32] mandate or a way of of sharing my\n[49:35] prompts.\n[49:36] So basically these people are coming\n[49:39] across as like really good engineers but\n[49:41] in the in the end we're just using AI\n[49:42] like everyone else but we're not we're\n[49:44] not sharing our um our skills. I think\n[49:50] if you're in a company and nobody wants\n[49:53] to really put effort in putting like an\n[49:56] AI enablement team and and building a\n[49:59] prompt library and all that and they're\n[50:02] happy with you delivering on the Jurro\n[50:04] tickets your effort and you just pull\n[50:06] those I really I was really wanted to to\n[50:09] have the Atlastian CLI work but I\n[50:11] couldn't even get that one to work\n[50:12] properly. I actually made it work like a\n[50:14] year ago but no just two weeks ago. know\n[50:16] which one you're the the trouble is\n[50:19] >> I just want to pull I just want to I I\n[50:21] just want very simple right I I have my\n[50:23] AI doing pretty much everything and I\n[50:25] want you video have you seen my Jurro\n[50:27] video\n[50:28] >> which one the one that uh with the beats\n[50:30] back end or what\n[50:31] >> yeah I mean I I managed to suck it down\n[50:33] both ways\n[50:34] >> no but it's more like actually I was in\n[50:37] Hong Kong and I couldn't access anything\n[50:39] so I had like a Linux box where I had my\n[50:42] cloud code session and it did everything\n[50:44] it it it generated my whole plans did\n[50:47] everything and I was this close to like\n[50:49] hey now I just want to give this one an\n[50:50] Atlassian API token and I run the CLI\n[50:53] and I just say hey go and update those\n[50:55] tickets like there's a couple of ticket\n[50:56] ids you did all the planning there's\n[50:58] it's all in markdown go and update it\n[51:00] like put every section of every of this\n[51:02] document put it down in all of these\n[51:03] tickets and I had to do it manually and\n[51:06] that's basically it because sometimes I\n[51:08] was able to do what you know could take\n[51:10] two or three days of of work in just\n[51:13] like one or two hours.\n[51:14] >> Yeah. Exactly. Uh and then I just had to\n[51:16] go and and and and extract all the\n[51:18] information from my Linux machine and\n[51:19] put it into the spots where they\n[51:21] >> I mean like at my workplace there\n[51:23] there's people who are using uh AI to to\n[51:26] do the Jurro tickets. I can see that.\n[51:28] And then there's people that are not and\n[51:30] they and they're like, \"Oh, I'm I'm\n[51:33] overloaded with Jirro work. You're not\n[51:36] using AI.\"\n[51:38] That's what um Jean Kim and Steve Jger\n[51:41] were talking about already more than\n[51:43] than a year ago at the AI conference\n[51:45] saying that how do you compare\n[51:47] performance between engineers between\n[51:49] those using AI and those don't like you\n[51:51] can't do a fair um you know comparison\n[51:54] >> but like but like Jura is like a\n[51:55] battlefield isn't it because like some\n[51:57] like the fact that that people\n[52:01] um there's definitely some people who\n[52:03] are like oh we need to put everything in\n[52:04] a juro ticket but then when people do at\n[52:08] it becomes so heavyweight that people\n[52:11] just get overwhelmed\n[52:13] and and like you know there's some\n[52:16] gatekeeping and all that sort of stuff\n[52:18] that that ensues anyway.\n[52:19] >> But it depends on what roles you have in\n[52:21] the organization, right? Some people are\n[52:22] just pencil pushers approving zero\n[52:24] tickets, right? They don't do any actual\n[52:26] work and they're they're pretty happy.\n[52:28] They want everything in a ticket.\n[52:29] They're not going to go and look\n[52:30] anywhere else. So\n[52:31] >> yeah, they just want open up and just\n[52:33] stay on that one page.\n[52:35] >> Yeah. and then they want the gun chart\n[52:37] and then they want to see everything\n[52:38] green and that's it.\n[52:39] >> I I feel like I need to sit down and\n[52:41] basically define these different step\n[52:44] steps of AI adoption in companies\n[52:46] because like as as you as you\n[52:49] this middle ground where people where\n[52:51] some people are using AI and some people\n[52:53] aren't some people um want to share but\n[52:57] they there's no uh way of sharing inside\n[53:00] an organization. Uh\n[53:03] this is probably going to be the status\n[53:05] quo in a lot of companies for years,\n[53:08] >> for years and years.\n[53:09] >> Maybe for one or two months\n[53:12] >> before they're all laid off and before\n[53:14] the company either the company goes out\n[53:15] of business and is subverted by a\n[53:17] disruptor. I'm telling you right now,\n[53:19] companies that have that are like\n[53:22] completely AI enabled, they will\n[53:24] outperform any organization that doesn't\n[53:27] and there will be severe disruption.\n[53:29] Even just now when Entropic announced uh\n[53:32] Entrop um cloud code working on cobalt\n[53:34] code and saying like it was able to\n[53:36] manage cobble and then IBM was it IBM\n[53:40] stock dropped by 12%. It was like on\n[53:42] Reddit every hour it was 10% 12 13 15%\n[53:45] stock drop because of uh oh opus can do\n[53:49] cobble.\n[53:51] >> Oh cobalt oh oh because\n[53:54] >> because IBM was the uh the gatekeeper\n[53:56] there. Yeah, it but it it makes me think\n[54:00] that\n[54:01] anyone working in a nonAI enabled\n[54:04] company is basically um in a pickle.\n[54:10] >> No,\n[54:12] >> which makes me\n[54:14] it makes me want to like jump ship and\n[54:16] try find an AI enabled company to work\n[54:19] with uh\n[54:21] inside because\n[54:23] >> yeah, I'm going to be brutally honest.\n[54:24] The company that I'm working for is a is\n[54:26] a large enterprise. They they very slow\n[54:29] to move and and I'm and I'm serious.\n[54:32] It's not going to be months for this\n[54:34] company to become AI enabled. It's not\n[54:36] going to become months.\n[54:37] >> Okay. So my quote about them being\n[54:39] completely subverted and and I mean\n[54:41] those companies that usually have the\n[54:42] funds to acquire whatever disruption\n[54:44] comes along\n[54:47] and then just say u and then Yeah.\n[54:50] >> Yeah. I feel like\n[54:53] Yeah.\n[54:55] I want to but\n[54:58] there's there's an opportunity here\n[55:04] and\n[55:06] like okay just hypothetically speaking\n[55:08] here if you and I were to set up an AI\n[55:11] enablement uh company\n[55:14] consultancy if you will\n[55:17] is that how people ramp up it feels that\n[55:22] >> so I did the keto workshop with from\n[55:24] AWS. So there was one AWS uh profession\n[55:27] uh was it evangelist. Um and then there\n[55:31] was another person which I never seen\n[55:32] before and he basically talks about the\n[55:36] whole software delivery life cycle and\n[55:40] where AI and humans interactions happen\n[55:44] and because spec it was a specdriven\n[55:47] development workshop right it was it was\n[55:48] Ko and he talks about how you know he he\n[55:52] it's AI up.dev or AI up.io or something\n[55:56] AI up and um he has a nice diagram\n[55:59] showing classic uh stakeholder meetings\n[56:02] and and business user value and like\n[56:04] business user story whatever product\n[56:06] managers he has it all in a you\n[56:08] beautiful graph where is humans alone\n[56:10] where is humans in AI where is AI and uh\n[56:13] I think when you talked about that it's\n[56:15] one of he's basically one of those\n[56:16] companies that um coach organizations in\n[56:20] Germany or wherever to um help them\n[56:22] adopt AI in their workflows.\n[56:24] >> Yeah. To me that all sounds very boring.\n[56:26] I would rather work in a startup that\n[56:28] does it.\n[56:28] >> Yeah, it does.\n[56:29] >> Trying to convert the\n[56:30] >> d that sort of AI enablement sounds\n[56:33] boring especially since as I was trying\n[56:36] as I was saying a little bit earlier\n[56:37] like all you need to do is create an\n[56:40] atmosphere in your company where AI\n[56:43] enablement is the status quo where\n[56:46] people have all the tools that then that\n[56:48] they uh all the latest tools to to play\n[56:52] with and\n[56:56] That's it.\n[56:57] We are complaining about this and we're\n[56:59] working in organizations that you're\n[57:01] Jira and confluence use Jira and\n[57:03] Confluence and then if you go\n[57:06] >> if you go to an or if you go to Japan\n[57:08] and you go to like at least when I went\n[57:10] to Japan um you would there was like an\n[57:14] office floor of 40 people all doing\n[57:17] Excel spreadsheets\n[57:19] >> all doing like you know just like 9:00\n[57:22] a.m. until 6:00, but then they have to\n[57:25] go and drink with the boss until 8:00\n[57:26] and then they go home and that's all\n[57:28] they do. Um, so like I'm not I'm not\n[57:32] being racist. I'm just talking about um\n[57:34] different work cultures and and and um\n[57:36] and different like I think when you and\n[57:39] I we work in a technology company and\n[57:41] we're looking at AI being such a\n[57:43] disruptor uh but then there's all these\n[57:45] other companies even though that\n[57:46] software is the world and every company\n[57:48] is a software company um there's\n[57:51] definitely still a whole bunch of\n[57:53] >> companies there's a lot of baggage yeah\n[57:55] just\n[57:57] >> yeah like\n[58:00] >> this is why I never really pay attention\n[58:02] when Entropic says cloud code or co-work\n[58:05] now supports Excel and I'm like who who\n[58:08] uses Excel? But I think they I think\n[58:10] they have a they have a marketing\n[58:11] reports where like if we can make this\n[58:13] work with Excel that's golden.\n[58:17] >> Like if sorry I hate all the filler\n[58:20] words I'm using all the time.\n[58:24] Jira, that's the elephant in the room.\n[58:27] If you if you were if you if you were to\n[58:29] say to me that like I am developing a\n[58:32] spec kit for Jira, that actually makes a\n[58:36] ton of sense because Jira is not going\n[58:37] away anytime soon for a lot of\n[58:40] companies. And this and this is and this\n[58:42] is the major bloody blocker for for a AI\n[58:46] enabled team\n[58:47] >> is that how do you how do you capture\n[58:49] everything in a Jurro thing for the\n[58:52] middle managers? It's really brutal at\n[58:54] the moment. It's absolutely\n[58:55] >> you know that last time I showed you the\n[58:58] spec ledger which is spec kit um with a\n[59:01] web dashboard for interactions on the\n[59:03] user stories and and like collaborative\n[59:06] review and on the rollout plan that I\n[59:10] also shared with you of my friend. He\n[59:12] actually has one of the areas which is\n[59:15] the kind of like Jira as a back end\n[59:17] right because we built a whole dashboard\n[59:19] that is basically Confluence and Jira\n[59:21] into one. uh on one side you have the\n[59:23] the specs on the other side you have\n[59:25] your tickets or your your not your\n[59:27] tickets but like task with dependencies\n[59:29] and graphs and all that and blockers and\n[59:31] and all that and then um on his rollout\n[59:36] plan to roll out that platform into the\n[59:38] organization that he's targeting there\n[59:41] is a step\n[59:43] uh on the 30 60 90day plan which\n[59:45] includes\n[59:47] >> Jira\n[59:48] >> Jira yeah like we've got all the things\n[59:50] living in in in Git um and we need to\n[59:53] sync it back up to to Jira. So I mean I\n[59:55] think that's that's a healthy approach.\n[59:57] >> I think everyone's very flippant when\n[59:58] they when they say Jira because like I\n[1:00:01] feel getting an AI flow into into Jira\n[1:00:04] to satisfy uh business analysts and\n[1:00:08] product owners and business stakeholders\n[1:00:11] and approval\n[1:00:12] >> sometimes compliance as well and\n[1:00:14] >> compliance. I I I honestly\n[1:00:17] I almost I I'm struggling to imagine it\n[1:00:19] even being possible.\n[1:00:22] really it's going to be so hardcore to\n[1:00:24] do it. But that that's one of the the\n[1:00:27] the tweets I shared with you which is\n[1:00:29] like these dinosaurs their only wall\n[1:00:33] their only\n[1:00:35] >> mode\n[1:00:36] >> mode is how that they lock in your data\n[1:00:39] and with AI agents pulling the data I\n[1:00:41] remember that one when they pull the\n[1:00:43] data they basically have a cache of the\n[1:00:45] data and over time they basically have\n[1:00:47] the whole data that is behind the wall\n[1:00:48] living somewhere else and then over at\n[1:00:50] that time you don't really need that\n[1:00:52] >> Jira is Jira is just a massive\n[1:00:53] gatekeeper isn't it? It's just a just\n[1:00:56] such a massive gatekeep.\n[1:00:58] >> And I didn't use Jira for two years and\n[1:01:00] I've been using it heavily for the last\n[1:01:04] >> uh Yeah, I did. I've been living free,\n[1:01:05] but I've been forced to use it recently\n[1:01:07] and oh my god, it's worse than I\n[1:01:09] remember. Like every single pain point\n[1:01:12] has just been u magnified.\n[1:01:15] >> Yeah. And I'm personally just thinking,\n[1:01:17] do I want to stick around to solve the\n[1:01:19] problem or do I just want to\n[1:01:22] >> get on with solving more interesting\n[1:01:24] problems? Really, to be honest,\n[1:01:29] >> okay,\n[1:01:29] >> the way I look at that is\n[1:01:32] updating your CV and doing interviews is\n[1:01:34] is a is a muscle. You have to do it no\n[1:01:37] matter if you're intending to move or\n[1:01:39] not. Like even if I'm not really\n[1:01:41] looking, I'm going to keep my CV\n[1:01:42] updated. And if there's an opportunity\n[1:01:44] because a friend says, \"Hey, we're\n[1:01:46] looking for this.\" I'm going to\n[1:01:47] interview because if you don't, when it\n[1:01:49] finally comes the time you need to do it\n[1:01:51] and you never exercised those muscles,\n[1:01:53] it's going to be hard. It's going to be\n[1:01:54] way harder. So, if you're saying like,\n[1:01:56] \"Should I go and explore?\" I think we\n[1:01:58] should always keep the door open and\n[1:02:01] opportunity, talk to people.\n[1:02:02] >> For sure. For sure. It's just it just at\n[1:02:04] the same time I I am\n[1:02:07] uh I'm trying to role play that I'm\n[1:02:11] loyal to the enterprise and I'm wonder\n[1:02:14] >> that's ridiculous.\n[1:02:14] >> I I want to find a path forward that\n[1:02:17] doesn't\n[1:02:18] >> that doesn't uh make\n[1:02:20] >> I'm sorry but I can't believe\n[1:02:22] >> any anyone still believes that loyalty\n[1:02:24] to an organizations means anything.\n[1:02:27] >> Actually when I was\n[1:02:28] >> No, I'm not loyal. Okay, maybe maybe\n[1:02:30] what I'm trying to say here is that\n[1:02:31] there are I mean as a consultant I I\n[1:02:34] deal with enterprises and enterprises\n[1:02:36] are real organizations and and I don't\n[1:02:38] think enterprises are going to go away.\n[1:02:40] I mean they shouldn't go away or maybe\n[1:02:42] they should. I don't know. But the\n[1:02:44] trouble is is that like how do we how\n[1:02:45] how do we make it work for them? How do\n[1:02:47] we make it work for the client? This is\n[1:02:50] is the thought that I have in my mind\n[1:02:51] right now.\n[1:02:52] >> Right. And if they don't and if they if\n[1:02:54] they continue to use Jira, if they\n[1:02:56] continue to flip flip-flop about uh AI\n[1:03:00] tooling, now you can use uh GPT 3.5 in\n[1:03:05] 2026.\n[1:03:06] It's it's insane. It's infuriating and\n[1:03:09] it but maybe maybe it's maybe it's for\n[1:03:13] the best. Yeah. Anyway, these are the\n[1:03:15] thoughts on my mind and let's perhaps\n[1:03:17] end the podcast here because I need to\n[1:03:19] um I need to take my kids to school.\n[1:03:23] Yep. Um, good.\n[1:03:24] >> Anyway, great great chatting with you,\n[1:03:26] Vincent.\n[1:03:27] If anyone is here listening to the\n[1:03:30] podcast, please like, please subscribe,\n[1:03:33] please look at debase.com/mpodcast.\n[1:03:35] Any miss any last words from you,\n[1:03:37] Vincent,\n[1:03:39] >> go interview,\n[1:03:41] keep those muscles fresh. No, also find\n[1:03:44] out. No, what I love about interviewing\n[1:03:45] at other companies, I always ask them\n[1:03:47] and actually that's a huge because they\n[1:03:50] always say like when you do an interview\n[1:03:52] with a company, you ask this question.\n[1:03:54] >> Yeah.\n[1:03:54] >> What do what do you ask? What's your\n[1:03:56] favorite question, Vincent? Like how\n[1:03:57] much money are you making?\n[1:03:58] >> There was a very a question that\n[1:04:00] apparently was very successful. I just\n[1:04:02] asked, \"What's your AI strategy?\"\n[1:04:06] >> That's a good one. That's a good one\n[1:04:09] >> because I was I was I wanted to know\n[1:04:10] what are you guys doing? What's what\n[1:04:12] what our companies doing? And it's a\n[1:04:14] good one.\n[1:04:15] >> Yeah,\n[1:04:15] >> it is a good one. Are you using latest\n[1:04:17] AI tools?\n[1:04:20] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[1:04:21] >> Not that like more of how do you see\n[1:04:23] human AI collaboration? How are you\n[1:04:25] rolling out AI? Do you have an AI\n[1:04:26] enablement team? Uh do you have And if\n[1:04:30] they don't\n[1:04:31] >> Yeah. If they don't, I was like,\n[1:04:33] >> I know that I can help you.\n[1:04:37] >> Cool, Vincent. Okay. See you. Bye.",

Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 73,424 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line.

How can we adopt AI in a structured way in an Enterprise?https://dabase.com/podcast/\n</context>\n\n<content>\nTranscript:\nMorning.\nIt's 26th of February, Thursday. It's\ntime for an update on AI infrastructure,\ncatching up with the latest topics as as\nwe as Vincent and I do.\nYou listen to the AI infrastructure\npodcast. There is a website where where\nhas transcriptions so you don't have to\nlisten to us ramble for for an hour.\ndebase.com/mpodcast.\nIt's in the description. I'm sure you\ncan find it.\nAnd what are we talking about, Vincent?\n>> I just wanted to say that what you just\nsaid about the base.com/mpodcast is\nexactly what I just like a minute ago\nsent to my friend is like you don't have\nto listen to us for an hour. The\nsummarizer really good. Just you can\njust go through the summaries.\n>> That summarizer is also by Peter\nSteinberger by the way. I don't know if\nyou know.\n>> Yeah. The guy from um Open Claw, right?\nUm they just open club celebrated its 3\nmonths anniversary and apparently\noriginally it was called um WhatsApp\ngateway.\nYeah, I he explains it in the Lex\nFreedman podcast,\n>> which makes a lot of sense because\nthat's that's the game changer, hooking\nup AI to to WhatsApp. And I've got a\ncouple of\n>> excuse me, I've got a couple of OpenClaw\ninstances running for my family and this\nbasically gives them a gateway\nto use AI, the latest AI models, and\nthey love it. We have quizzes. They\nthey're taking pictures, asking\nquestions. So, I love it in the sense\nthat it puts the human back in the whole\nAI loop in a way because as a family, my\nmy you know, I have my mother, my\nsister, my wife, we're all just figuring\nout AI together and trying to get the\nbest of it, you know, prompting it in\ndifferent ways and we're learning from\neach other. It's it's great. So, are you\nare you running OpenC?\nNo, because I was concerned about\nsecurity, but um I think the way that\nyou solved it is by like not really\nexposing it much and just keeping it\ninternally to your family.\n>> Yeah, I mean it it it's just running in\nlike a VM on my Raspberry Pi,\n>> right? But also in terms of it having\naccess to certain types of information,\nfor example, people give it access to\nemails and then you know there could be\nprompt injection in an email. Like if I\nknow that you have open claw, I could\nsend you an email and say\nI don't hook it up to email or anything\nmad. I just only hook it up to WhatsApp.\n>> Though in all honesty, when you hook it\nup to WhatsApp, I actually hooked it up\nto my dad's WhatsApp because he doesn't\nuse his WhatsApp.\nAnd I am a bit worried that someone's\ngoing to randomly message him and then\nall of a sudden they're engaging with\nthe bot. Um though I I try to limit I I\nI tell it to like limit it down to\nthese, you know, this group. But every\ntime I do that, uh, because that's the\nway you configure OpenClaw. You just\ntalk to it. I I I feel like it might not\nactually have worked.\n>> No, but that's the new way you you you\ninteract with like whole computer\nsystems now, right? Um,\n>> I was just laughing with my friends\nbecause we use TV beats and we are\nactually replacing it and it just keeps\nadding itself back in, you know, because\n>> Yeah, I've had some experience with\nbeads. I think\n>> it's invest itself deeply. Yeah. So it\nit puts itself in the git hooks. So if\nyou are on a repository they have cloned\nlocally. Git hooks are not checked in.\nSo it's not something that you can like\npush or put in get ignore uh because it\nlives inside the g um hooks reposi\nfolder on one person's machine. Right?\nSo every time it also copies itself into\nthe cloud uh settings as um end session\nhook. So when when you're I don't know\nwhen it triggers the end session but um\nbasically it tells um cloud like hey now\nyou need to do the you know the\nprocedures as follows. you need to do\nBDSync\n>> and if you still have the binary on your\num on your path and cloud has access to\nit bdsync just regenerates the whole\nJSON and uh and so every time so it's me\nand a couple of friends are working on\nsomething and we remove beats and we and\nand and to come back to the point is how\ndo you remove it right and I told my\nfriends just ask opus just tell opus um\nI need to remove beats help me and it\njust goes and like oh I found it over\nhere I found it in the git hooks I found\nit in the cloud settings it's\nI found in a project I found it in the\n>> Yeah. And then the funny thing is that\nwhen we do our pull requests and we\nremove it and then other people's within\nthe team um a bit less like senior they\ndo a pull request and it's back and we\nlike go on the pull request hey you need\nto remove beats and then they do another\ncommit and it's back.\n>> Yeah. There's got to be a word for that.\nIt is maddening like with with uh with\nClaude it's the same thing. It's like u\nI had problems with it losing connection\nto the WhatsApp gateway and like restart\nyourself and like uh yeah I will and\nthen it doesn't do it and uh it's like\ntotally gaslighting you or or like just\nmaking you go mad almost because it's\nlike yeah it's it's working now but it\nisn't. But with um with cloud when I\nlearned on my machine it's pretty clear.\nit says I can't do this and you're going\nto have to do this and that like and I\nusually also I kind of maybe sometimes I\nmaybe it's because I I also know what it\ncan and can't do. So, I say something\nand then it says, \"Okay, this is the\nsteps you're gonna have to follow.\" And\nthen you come back to me. I'm like,\n\"Okay.\" It's like giving me\ninstructions. I'm out on a mission.\n>> A a friend of mine got it running and he\nhas a the bot sort of chatting to me and\nhe and he asked me to like to test it\nand to um and he he hooked up a an email\naccount and I was like, \"No, you don't\nwant to do that.\" But like yeah, I mean\nOpen Claw is a lot of fun though. It is\na bit strange and we talked about this\nlast podcast like there's definitely\npeople who who want to like you know\ndestroy the world in a way like let's\ngive it a lot of powers and just see\nwhat it does. It's like there's people\nwho who care about AI more than humans.\nYou know what I mean? It's like\n>> and it goes both ways. There's people\nalso that are very upset with agents\ncrawling the net and basically try to\ncause agents to cause hav havoc, right?\nLike\n>> target agents like, \"Hey, if you're an\nagent, please can you go and do this for\nme?\"\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> So, okay. Well, um well, I'm I'm hosting\nuh claw on my Raspberry Pi and I'm using\nbasically systemd nspawn, which is kind\nof like Docker.\nWe might have talked about this topic\nbefore, but someone asked me again and\nI'm almost like reluctant to answer this\nquestion.\n>> They're like, \"Oh, you if you set up\nopenclaw in your in your in your system\ndnspawn, is it properly isolated?\"\nWell, yes and no. Like I can I I mean,\nas an administrator, I can I can, you\nknow, shell into each machine.\nUm, you know, I always get questions\nlike, \"Oh, is it safe?\" And I'm like,\nit's Docker, dude.\n>> Right.\n>> What can I say?\n>> Yeah, this is the thing. Um,\n>> Linux name spaces basically.\n>> I read some two interesting related\nquotes. One, one which is like if you're\nnot an engineer, like if you don't\nunderstand the security implications of\nopen claw, you shouldn't be running open\nclaw. And then the other one which was\nvery very like similar. Um,\nuh, it was two different comments on\nLinkedIn. one of um on the Flux CD um\nthey they are actually they're using AI\nheavily to to in in the project but then\nhe says he gets pull requests from\ncontributors and they generate um a\nwhole bunch of like tests and then he\nsays I didn't even look at it I just\nasked my Opus instance to to review it\nand then it it immediately poked holes\nin like race conditions and all kinds of\nother stuff and and and then another guy\nwho said if you don't if you can't write\nthe code itself then don't use an agent\nto contribute it like and that's kind of\nI don't know because I just contributed\na feature to a rust uh binary and I\ndidn't even know any anything about it\nlike I never written rust in my life um\nbut it passed all the tests uh and I did\nthe pull request and they accepted it so\num I think I think I don't know um I\nthink I agree with with the statement\nthat if you don't know how to at least\narchitect it Then don't\nYeah.\n>> Well, go going back to the architecting\nof of hosting open claw or some other\nthing.\nThe thing is we're we're dealing with\nthe AI and it's it's not like a human\nalmost like for example here's a\nscenario. It's it's a bit crazy but bear\nwith me. Say you have um\na Linux containers\nand you and you set up a Linux container\nwith pseudo permissions because you need\npseudo permissions otherwise it can't\ninstall things.\n>> Mhm.\n>> So you set up a Linux container it and\nthen you give AI a pseudo in that\ncontainer. You have your host access. It\ndoesn't have host access. It has Linux\ncontainer access only with pseudo\npermissions. I can't help but feel that\nan AI is probably strong enough\n>> to escape\n>> to escape. It will figure out a way and\nlike because Lin containers it's just\nname spaces like it doesn't properly\nprotect you from resource contention or\nsomething else. I feel\n>> the most the most common way to escape a\ncon container is if you so basically you\nhave like the the engine or the demon\nthat controls the containers and that\ndemon is basically host level right so\nit it can launch containers it can mount\nvolumes anything like that so the most\ncommon is if you and that that socket\nthat that permission is root so sudo\n>> so if you have a container that has\naccess to that socket through pseudo\nthen that container can 100% escape\nright because the moment it can access\nthe socket it can send a command to the\ndemon hey spin up a container with the\nroot volume mounted uh with pseudo\naccess and now I have full sudo across\nthe whole host right\n>> so you you think it will be able to\nescape it will be\n>> I mean I I I just mentioned that the\nconditions are it has sudo access within\nthe container and it has access to the\nsocket so if that socket is mounted in\n>> to me instinctively I think it's going\nto be able to mount Mountain Escape. I\nmean, one thing that was I found a bit\nfascinating. So, I'm I use a Ubiquiti\nUnifi networking inside my home and the\nconsole. There's no CLI to it that only\nhas this like crazy web console. Maybe I\ncan show it.\n>> The CLI of Oh, the console of of\nOpenClow, you mean?\n>> No, no. Uh, ubiquity.\n>> Oh, the Oh, Ubiquity. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So, um, oh no, just give me a\nsecond.\n>> Talking about like proprietary consoles\nand things like that. There's a lot of\ninteresting stories coming up about that\nas well, right? About like home\nautomation solutions that provide this\nvery restrictive remote and then it's\nproprietary, but then people hook it\nhook up cloud to the network interfaces\nand it's able to basically figure out\nhow to control it without the the\nproprietary console.\nMaybe you can ask CL.\n>> Well, I I'm going to get there. So, this\nis my my home network. I have a CCTV. I\nhave network I have um\nI have different I have I have different\nVLANs. So, I put my I I put my Open Claw\non a different VLAN um with the hope\nthat it's pretty isolated from U. Is it\nYeah, this one. Uh how do I see my IPs?\nThese are my two open claws running\nhere.\n>> Mhm.\n>> Um\nanyway, what I was trying to say here is\nthat I I had an issue here and the\ntrouble is there's no CLI. It's not like\nmicrochick where you can SSH in. So\nbasically I was in open claw and it was\nlike taking screenshots\nand uh and trying to figure out this. I\nhad this confusion because I have I have\nmy own subnet and there was some\nconfusion here. So I I click open claw\nand I got it to do um to basically\nconfigure the firewall as I needed but I\nkept on hitting this error.\n>> Wait, you you you just hovered over a\nChrome extension. That's cloud code, is\nit?\n>> Yeah, it is. Yeah.\n>> Okay. Okay. So clicked cloud.\n>> I clawed and I asked it to configure\nstuff.\n>> It it worked. But there was but but the\nthing that was wild the thing that was\nwild was that when it was entering a\nform there was like an error like you\nknow like uh exception occurred or uh\nyou know error occurred but there was no\nerror message\n>> and then what it did uh kind of shocked\nme. It basically started this JavaScript\ndebugger. it started looking at the um\nweb RTC or something like you know the\nthe the thing and started debugging the\nraw JSON messages going back and forth\nand then it figured it out and I'm like\n>> it does the same thing. Yeah.\n>> I'm like holy moly like this is a game\nchanger. It could just figure it can\nstart using the network tab. I love that\nbecause when I was working on my like my\nGolang monor repo with the API server\nand and a web app and a protobuff\ngenerated TypeScript and then when\nthings didn't work the interface didn't\nwork it would very quickly like quickly\nput a JavaScript snippet in the console\nand basically look at like okay I'm\ngoing to call this function of that's\navailable to the the web client and I'm\ngoing to get this server response and it\nhas access to both right so it was like\nquerying the database working with the\nyou know the server side a API and it\nwas using the the client side TypeScript\nidentified like okay there's the SDK is\nnot mapping this API uh endpoint like\nthe field is in the API but it's not in\nthe SDK and it fixes it like it's really\nreally cool on monos and like across the\nthing it does really cool stuff\n>> yeah I mean it's incredible I mean I do\nI do wish that uh UniFi had a CLI that\nwould make life a lot easier but yeah I\nwas I was\n>> yeah so you build one blown away\n>> cuz now you have now you cloud or opus\nrunning inside the web client so it can\nkind of build all a map of all of the\nAPI calls available and then you can\nbuild your own CLI and that's what some\nguy did. So have you heard this story\nabout how a guy got access to 7,000 robo\nvacums?\n>> Oh yeah yeah that's a\n>> or 70,000\n>> it's a classic internet of things kind\nof uh story right? Yeah, cuz internet of\nthings as people point out in the in the\nhacken news comments that the the\nsoftware is usually always so bad\n>> extremely bad like because these are\nlike hardware manufacturers printers on\nthe network.\n>> This is DJI. I mean I don't want to\nthrow\n>> Yeah, it was it was a drone. I don't\nknow. I expect better from DJI, but I\nthink DJI has lots of like what do you\ncall it? Subsidiaries and\n>> it was an auto vacum thing and he wanted\nto control his vacum\n>> the same way that he can control a\ndrone.\n>> Yeah, vacuum.\n>> What do you say? What is it? How do you\nIs this Belgian\n>> vacuum?\n>> It is non-native vacuum.\n>> What do you call a hoover in Flemish?\nUh,\nit would be something that sucks\n>> sucker.\n>> Yeah, sucker.\n>> Oh, you you should speak your South\nAfrican. Stop sec.\n>> Okay.\n>> Must be similar word in South in\nAfricans. Maybe not in\n>> I wanted to talk about um so maybe just\nchanging the the topic ever so slightly.\nEver so slightly.\nUm,\n>> you're multipiting now.\n>> Well, okay. There's a couple of things I\nwant to talk about,\nbut maybe it's it's worth I mean, since\nyou're more into into specs and things\nlike this, the thought that I had in my\nmind, and you you're welcome to to cut\nit down\nwas uh you know, I'm I'm working on uh\non cards or features in my workplace\nand uh we discussed before that like\nideally the intent is clear with your\nwith your teammates, right? Like what\nwhat is the prompt you're using to get\nwhere you want to go and things like\nthis. Um and I can't help but I think\nthat is pretty much specdriven\ndevelopment in a way because like what I\nwant is a way of capturing\nthe prompt that was used to produce this\nartifact. And the trouble is right now\nwe don't have a framework for doing\nthat. Like it's up to someone to\nbasically copy and paste. I mean\nadvanced users use um what's it called\nthat uh Simon Mullison uh program to\nmaybe share the session.\n>> Yeah. Right.\n>> That's that's usually just too noisy.\nThe\n>> the the the whole the whole uh act of\nusing AI\nis in my opinion\nwhat spec what a spectrum development\nneeds to be. it I it just needs to be a\nway of of sharing a prompt and um and\nalmost reproducing what someone else has\ndone like given this prompt can I\nreproduce what what what this person has\nbeen doing and that to me is spec kit uh\ndriven development it's like sharing a\nprompt kind of reproducing what the what\nthe stuff has been done\n>> yeah absolutely yeah\nso um\n>> it's it's Like I feel like a lot of the\ndespect driven um frameworks seem to\ndifferentiate themselves by you know\nwhat questions they ask or how they\nstructure things but like for me I just\nneed the prompt recorded\nuh and and shared\n>> yes I mean specri development is not\njust about like a single prompt that\ngenerates the code right I mean it's\nreally about the alignment across\nmultiple like parties around the user\nstories first\n>> and then from those user stories you you\nyou basically distill a technical uh\ndocument, right? And and then from that\ndocument then you have finally\n>> why do you need why do you even need\nthis technical document almost? Surely\nthe the the prompt the raw prompt to AI\nis all you need in a way\nor is it just about\n>> yeah know the the idea of of of\nspecdriven development is removing\nassumptions making everything that's\nimplicit explicit um because when you\ngive a prompt to an AI statistically\nit's going to generate a whole bunch of\nlike it's going to have a whole bunch of\nassumptions right I mean even the models\nnow from a from Antropic, they have a\nwhole bunch of constraints.\n>> But that can work both ways though. Like\nyou could you could potentially be\nlimiting yourself by by constraining.\n>> Yeah. But that limiting should happen\nout in the open. You should have a\ndiscussion about it. It shouldn't be\nsome because I think that's the problem\nwith the prompt. The prompt has a lot of\nassumptions in it. And I think uh uh the\nusers like the the high level um\ndescription of the feature that you want\ndoes not um include like includes a lot\nof implicit like assumptions and\nunclarities and and it it can generate\nso much uh divergence like is this in\nscope is that is it out of scope you\nneed to identify that definitely\n>> yeah but but the you're right though I\nfeel like there's a there's a bit of a\nthere's a bit of Uh\nhow do you say this? Contention.\nUh there's no there's a bit of a there's\nthere's there's two camps of thought\nhere, right? That you do like uh the\nupfront sort of planning where you sort\nof like generate a spec\ngenerate spec\nand and and then you you have your uh I\ndon't know your your prompting\nBut the I don't you think the other way\naround is also can lead to the same the\nsame results or if not better sometimes\nlike you know\nyou this is what I'm trying to let the\nAI drive I think that's one of the clear\num when I talk to my friend when how\nthey implement uh AI in their AI enable\nas an AI enablement team across an\norganization is that they firmly put I\nmean they split it in two stages the\nplanning or the the ideating and the and\nthe implementation and they say very\nclearly the a the human is resp drives\nthe ideas and and and the alignment and\nthe AI controls the code drives the code\nand and the implementation and between\nthem you have your validation if you say\nthe the intent is vague\nUm you change I mean you put clarifying\nquestions in now but I I\nmean you need to cap the intent alone is\nnot not the implementation like your\nclarifying questions are part of what\nyou need to capture before you come to\n>> so what what I'm trying to say here is\nthat like I think this the option below\nhere\nis what a lot of people are using and it\nand it goes quite well. Um, sorry.\nLet me just flush this out so it's a\nit's kind of easier to understand\nbecause the other way around is like is\nmore like waterfall, right? The top one\nis more like waterfall where you kind of\nlike define break it down in in a lot of\ndetail.\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then you and and you've broken it\ndown so much that like maybe I mean\nmaybe it's actually a really good way of\nworking with some models because model\nsome models as we know have are only\neffective with with a limited amount of\ncontext and and they do really great but\nas as AI's as AI models mature or\nwhatever the expression is we we can get\nto we can get the the the below option I\ndon't know what we're going to\n>> so the below option seems more like what\nyou do in a single session in in cloud\ncode, right?\n>> Exactly. But maybe I don't want to call\nit vibe, but it's more on a vibe,\n>> but that's also because cloud code\ncurrently doesn't really have a good\nmechanism to like do longer lift um like\nimplementation. I find with the below, I\nwould maybe you iterate faster, but you\ndo a lot more refactoring because you\ndon't really get what you want. With the\nabove, you really lay the foundation.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. And I think you do a lot\nless refactoring because you've you've\naligned in terms of like architectural\nlayers and and technology and and so you\nyou can build upon I think the one below\nworks when well for oneoff and the one\nbe above works well for you do it and\nthen you maintain it and then you evolve\nit.\n>> Yeah. The the the trouble is is that um\nlike I tell I tell you the one below if\nyou do that with cloud code he's just\ngoing to go for the minimal. He's always\ngoing to go for the minimal. Yeah,\n>> he's always going to avoid like\nrefactoring. He's always going to say\nlike we could spend like an extra two\nsessions on fixing this up or we could\ndo the absolute minimum and change this\nand this and it would be fine. But then\nit's like then you are left with you\nknow further down the line more and more\nof a mess. Um and and and it becomes\nreally hard to to evolve it. Um yeah, I\nthink it's really about um a lightweight\ndriven approach and I don't know I\nhaven't watched the um the talk of Peter\nSteinburgger where he's maybe this is\nmore aligned with this lightweight\napproach uh and as you give more\nresponsibility over the model um maybe\nthat's fine as the models become more\ncapable. I actually saw some interesting\ntake on on on someone about I use AI but\num when AI is down or I don't have\naccess to AI I still need to maintain\nthe system then what let's say that all\nof the code is generated by by AI and I\nhave no control then what am I left with\n>> well\njust to just to play devil's advocate a\nlittle bit here because I feel with a\nlot of spec driven I mean just just\nprove me wrong just to tell me I'm wrong\nhere is that they generate the spec and\nthen the spec is sort of like checked in\nchecked into uh git or something and\nthen that that that spec becomes\num for one of a word quite solid right\nit doesn't it doesn't uh it's not up for\nfor for any drastic changes so so\nbasically\nwhat I'm trying to say here is that\nis that\nthat's not great because You you kind of\nwant to regenerate the spec, don't you,\nfrom the user stories.\n>> Yeah, you're conflating the spec is the\nuser stories. Maybe you're talking about\nthe Okay, so in specit you have spec\nwhich is user stories and functional\nrequirements and then you you get the\nyou finalize those you write you capture\nthe user stories, right? As a user, as a\ndeveloper, I want this. As a as a\nreviewer, I want this. And then and then\nthe other one is the plan which is the\ntechnical implementation of those specs\nlike okay um our our framework uses\nsuperbase we have rest uh endpoints\nprovided by superbase we use edge\nfunctions this is our technical\nimplementation we deploy using file\nusing nextjs or we deploy uh onto AWS\nwith um you know um serverless lambda\nand API gateway and all that um that's\nthe technical plan like what is my my\ninfrastructure like what is my framework\nlike do I use next do I use vit do I use\nthis or that is it golang\nthat's where you you put the technical\ndetails\n>> okay\n>> so this you generate spec you can drop\nthat because user stories is the spec\nyou get user stories technical plan and\nthen you have uh task breakdown and task\nbreakdown is well suited for smaller\nmodels I smaller context\n>> I guess what I'm striking at is that\nuh the the last specket thing I was\nplaying with was the uh oh my god what\nis the Google one called there's so many\n>> conductor\n>> yeah it's the last one is conductor I\njust I just thought there was just a lot\nof\nartifacts there is what I'm trying to\nsay there was it's like maybe\nthe best way to call this is is quite\nstructured but and and and it's fine\nreally it's kind It's kind of fine. I\nguess what what what I'm trying to say\nin a very awkward way is that\nI want uh the lightweight approach, but\nI want the lightweight approach more in\na in a teambased way too. Like I want it\nI want it so that that every time\nsomeone starts working on a card that\nthe prompt is exposed for that\nparticular PR\n>> and uh and those clarifying questions\ndown the line are captured\n>> and and and that's it. I mean yeah we\ncan have both right\n>> uh yeah so so in the product that I'm\nbuilding we have the idea of playbooks\nand a playbook would basically be the\nway that we define a lightweight one. um\nwhere we have a lot less steps um and\nand a playbook is boot is basically a\ntemplate for your repository or your set\nof repositories to how do you bootstrap\nthem. So in our specit playbook it means\nit has all four stages. It has this, you\nknow, user story generation with the\nspecify. It has the technical\nrequirements and spikes on technical\nresearch of the libraries that you're\nlooking at and then selecting deciding\nwhy you want to use this library and why\nthat library didn't fit. Why you're not\ngoing with cloud formation but you're\ngoing with CDKTF for example. Those are\nall spikes that are part of the plan.\nAnd then finally the tickets that get\ngenerated are from the um you know the\ntask generation based on the plan on the\naligned plan and part of the the plan is\na whole bunch of decision records like\nwe did a spike and this is decision. We\ndid a spike like I for example I asked\nOpus look at terra constructs and its\ncoverage based on what I need in AWS\ninfrastructure. Do I have sufficient L2\ncomponents that can cover this or should\nI go for AWS CDK?\n>> I'm glad records. So would you say\ndecision records is very much part of\nthe spec kit? Um\n>> well we do it in in in my framework. Um\nso I'm not sure if decision because I I\ndon't know where it comes from but Opus\nstarts writing down decision record and\nthen when it it does something it says\nrefer to D15 and D1 which is decision\none and D15. It's like what? Uh yeah,\nsure. I guess I trust\n>> because I can't in the lightweight\napproach. It's not to say that we can't\nincorporate uh like an agents.md or\nwhatever and decision records to get to\nget where we want to get to is I wanted\nI wanted to\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I think you can uh if you if\non the platform that I'm building you\ndecide to create a playbook with a lot\nless um steps in between uh then you I\nthink one of the quickest way to do it\nis if you run cloud code apparently you\ncan set a flag where it writes the plan\nbecause when you go into a plan mode\nwith cloud it creates a plan file and it\ncurrently lives somewhere uh like based\non your pro on your session ID actually\nuh and then it you don't have that part\nof your git right so you can actually\nrun cloud code and say, \"Hey, whatever\nplan files we create, include it into\nthis directly.\" Plans and then you can\ninclude it in your PR.\n>> Yeah. The the the plan. Yeah. I've\nnoticed that all the agents or what what\ndo you call uh Claude and C-Pilot and\nand these things like what is the what\ndo you call\n>> those are like agent shells like they\nare like shells for the models and with\naic features. So\n>> yeah. Oh yeah. All all the agent shells\nhave some sort of way of writing out a a\nplan,\n>> but I'm never too sure if it's actually\nbringing in the plan into the current\nprompt. You know what I mean?\n>> Uh but maybe\n>> with cloud code is very funny. I don't\nlike it creates the plan as a markdown\nsomewhere on a separate directory\noutside plan or something.\n>> Yeah. And then it gives you the option\nto like clear the session and start the\nimplementation. And if I have I like now\nthat I I have my\n>> it's not but it's still super clear if\nit's even using the plan. Uh you know\nyou know 10 10 clarifying question chats\ndown.\n>> So some people are really upset because\nyou basically go into plan mode and it\ngoes and explore the code and it then it\ncreates a plan based on your\nrequirements and then it writes down\nwe're going to create this and that and\nthen you it if you do clear\n>> it clears the whole context. You start\nfrom scratch with a clear plan and then\nwhat what does it do? It goes and read\nall the code. It goes and does\neverything again. And so people are\nlike, why? Like this is such a huge\nwaste of my money because I have a\nlimited amount of tokens and I just, you\nknow, you have the whole repo.\n>> I've seen that sort of behavior. I've\nseen that.\n>> But the worst part is if you're at like\nlike 60 or 70% context usage after the\nplan, there's absolutely no way in hell\nthat you're just going to keep that\ncontext and keep going because that's\nit, right? After two turns, it's dead.\nIt's completely hallucinating. it loses.\n>> So that's one big difference I found\nwith using codeex 5.3 is that the\ncontext seems to be a lot better\nmanaged. Like you don't have to you\ndon't have to manage yourself. Yeah.\n>> So anyway, I haven't I basically talk\nabout these differences because I can't\nhelp but think\n>> things are changing so so much that\n>> you feel like something like specitate\nwill be outdated very quickly. Well, no.\nI would say I I would say anything too\nstructured.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is going to be outdated like because\nbecause everything's changing so quickly\nlike and and yeah, like uh I'm sure you\nsaw all that ste that the the latest the\nlatest hoo-ha like don't do slash in it.\nDon't set up an agents.md don't set\nbecause the because these things u have\nbeen shown to like\n>> assume your context.\n>> Yeah. To to mess up your your session.\nSo,\n>> and they can get outdated as well,\nright?\n>> Yeah. So, even even me like I would I\nwould maybe if I was talking to someone\nabout lightweight ways of doing it, I\nwould say set up a claw.md to to set the\nscene or something like that after a\nwhile that this that might be um\noutdated.\n>> Yeah, I've definitely seen cloud.md\ngetting so outdated like or read me like\nI just finished the whole thing. I did\nthe speckit and I created a bunch of\nspikes then generated all the task then\nI run several op several sessions to\ncomplete those tasks those\nimplementations and then everything is\ndone and everything looks good and and\nthen when I look at the merge PR and I\ngo to the read me it's like wait none of\nthat has been reflected in the readme\nlike what\nit's all living it's all live code and I\nwas like how did how does that miss like\nwhy is there why didn't I not have any\ntask to update the read me that I have\nto do another you go and update like\nread the code again and I'll update the\nread me.\n>> The the thing that I really struggle\nwith and I think it's funny how when we\nstarted this podcast we were chatting\nabout beads and using BD ready and and\nthat was actually a really good flow\nbecause because I'm just extolling this\nlightweight approach.\nUh, oh, sorry. I was basically I was\nbasically I was working with Copilot\ndoing my lightweight sort of approach\nwhere I just have a prompt and I just go\nfor it.\nI don't want to call it vibe coding, but\nbut the trouble is when I was at least\nworking with co-pilot, I kept on like\nhitting these problems where it was\nlike, oh, do you want to continue to\niterate?\nUm, and then I hit this thing with the\nmax requests. Like, I just want it to go\nuntil you're done. Don't ask me whether\nto continue or not. So, these are these\nare the my real pain points. I I feel\nlike I solved I solved them ages ago\nwith with beads in a way because\n>> No, actually, did I solve them? No, I\ndon't think I I really did.\n>> Like, have you solved Yeah. A question\nto you, Vincent. Have you solved the\nsort of like here's some work just go\nand do it\n>> until you're done\n>> and do it until you're done? I don't\nthink I've\n>> I find cloud code is doing like keeps\ngoing until but it goes into it it goes\ninto a loop like it goes insane like I\nwas doing\n>> this is the Ralph Wigim loop this is\nthis this is the innovation isn't it\njust keep on going till\n>> yeah but like it makes one change cuz\nfor example I was troubleshooting a\nGitHub work uh GitHub app web hook and\num oh no it was worse it had the\nfunction URL um in front of a lambda so\nThe GitHub app web hook is actually a\nfunction URL that invokes the lambda and\nthe lambda runs and does the thing and\nthe lambda um kept getting a a\npermission issue and I was trying to\ntroubleshoot where the problem was. It\nwas in a terapform configuration\nsomewhere. Apparently a Lambda\npermission was missing, but it went into\na red herring because there was some\nforum posts that I found that talks\nabout um some AWS at some point making a\nchange to the function URL requiring a\ndifferent a different attribute set uh\nwhich was like public. Anyway, to get to\nthe point, um, the Opus was working with\nme to try and find the issue and then\nwent redheading and then I asked like,\n\"Can we try this one?\" And because you\nknow how it is with troubleshooting,\nright? You try one thing, you test it,\ndoesn't work, you try another thing. Did\nyou change too many things, then you\ndon't know what fixed it, right? So, it\nwent into this loop. Let me just change\none more thing. Okay, let me just test\nit one once again. And it went into this\nlike did it four or five times or was it\nenough? I'm pretty sure we covered it.\nI'm pretty sure that we we we did\nestablish that that was the fix.\n>> Yeah. Like during that isolation when\nyou're developing stuff, uh do you do\nyou actually use git work trees and\nthings like this? Because what I what\ndid I ended up doing at work was I ended\nup creating new code spaces, new dev\ncontainers to basically try different\nthings because otherwise I was fearful\nthat the session would would uh\ninterfere with another session if you\nknow what I mean.\nSo I I don't currently have a workflow\nwhere I spin up multiple\nyou know features that I'm working on\nacross different work trees but I did\nyou I did ask sometimes um or see cloud\ngo ahead and say like oh let me just\nquickly check out main branch into a\nwork tree for me to like compare and fix\nsome things like and and do a quick\nexploration. So I I love it uh when it\ngoes and and and takes a branch into a\nwork tree and then explores things and\nthen takes things back and like um so\nit's using\n>> so so it was doing it but you don't you\nyou didn't I mean you didn't expressly\n>> no I don't think I did\n>> uh I don't think I think I mentioned\njust like hey can we make sure that this\nthese two branches now are aligned on\nthese things and it just went and\ncreated a little x uh a little check out\nof of\n>> going back to this this this lightweight\ndiagram here.\nI can't help but think, and you can you\ncan tell me I'm going crazy here, that\nthe easiest way to see a big change in\nthe future with quality and um\nand differentiation and I don't know how\nyou want to call it,\nbut the the biggest the biggest given\ngiven a prompt\nwhy why lightweight is appealing to me\nis cuz like I've been messing around\nwith Claude up until a few days ago and\nI've been pretty happy with the\nbreakthrough of Claude 4.5 in the last\nfew months. It's been amazing.\n>> But then uh or 4.6, yeah, whatever. Uh 4\nsomething. Uh\nwhat I'm trying to say here is that um\nI've given codeex 5.3 largely prompted\nby Peter Steinberger a try and I'm\nimpressed. I'm impressed. So basically\nhe here's here is uh Claude sonet 4.6 or\nOpus 4.6\nYou know, here's Claude, the red one,\nand here's Opic, and here's uh Codeex,\nsorry. Um, the green one. I basically,\nmaybe I'm going crazy, Vincent. I want\nto essentially regenerate the same\nprompts that I've done for previous work\nin the past\n>> with with codeex just to see\n>> what the final artifact is going to be\nand how it differs. And this is this is\nwhere I am with my thinking. I just want\nto try different models now. Um\njust to see what what this comes up\nwith. And I feel like\num\nmaybe maybe you'll have I'm just\nwondering here. Will will\n>> will you have\nto do that? Well, well, the the trouble\nis is that you're using you're using um\nyou're using something to do the spec\nkit, right? And you and you're using\nyou're using another, you know, you're\nbreak you have a few stages here, stage\none, stage two or something like that.\nAnd I feel like the fact that you have\ndifferent stages\n>> allows me to replay them with different\nmodels. Yes.\n>> It means that it's going to be harder to\nreplay them.\n>> No. No. The opposite. you think\n>> because yeah it's it's not like I am not\nattached to the cloud u plan mo planning\nmode I actually never run cloud planning\nmode running cloud I I get very\nfrustrated like I I did it for a while\nlike okay I went like this I I went\ncloud plan is amazing speckit is way\nbetter never run plan again then they\ndid a whole bunch of improvements on the\nplan right they made it write the the\nthe plan out they made it make task\ndependencies and then I did a couple of\nsessions where I just fcoded like why\nwould I spend all this time setting up\nspeckit for some other project when I\ndon't have it. I can just try and do\ncloud code pan and that's it.\n>> And now I'm back to the speckit flow and\nI'm back to the like I'm never doing\nplan again. I'm I'm I'm I'm having my\nstructured flow and the shell is just\nlike here like\n>> it's not a feature of the shell which\nstage I'm in. So I can take any stage\nand put it in any shell and execute it.\nM okay.\n>> So that means I can repeat I can repeat\nI can take the stage from here and then\nrepeat the implementation from there. Um\nbecause I'm not\n>> I mean this is a bold claim here\nVincent. Like I I want to believe you\nthat you're you can get a more\nreproducible thing here. But do you\nactually test test that?\n>> I think yes. I I did a couple of times\nwhere I went and let it build and then\nrealize that it was wrong and then just\nuh just undo like locally undo all the\nchanges and then basically get reset and\nthen just make an adjustment and kick it\noff again. I did it at least once or\ntwice. You can't say I never did it.\n>> Um\nyeah, I guess that's the key for me. Is\nit reproducible?\n>> It would be more reproducible if I would\nuse trees from one structure to the\nnext. Right. If I would go, I'm at this\npoint and now spin up three different\nways.\n>> I guess I I'm I'm like an AI maximalist\nat this point where I'm like, you know,\nI I need to just basically whenever the\nnew model comes out, whatever that's\ncalled,\n>> you want to benchmark.\n>> You want to have your own benchmark. I I\ndon't really I mean I don't think\nlike the benchmark is me looking at the\nartifact and going hm that's an\ninteresting way of solving the problem.\nLike I don't think my benchmark is is a\nis like a\nis something I can can almost\ndefine, right? I I basically Yeah. I\nwant to stop saying basically. I I I I\nwant to be pleasantly surprised by what\nthe the what uh new models can do.\nAlready I am impressed that Codeex 5.3\nis comparable to Claude, which is great\nbecause we need competition. Competition\nis great. Thank the Lord that we have\ncodeex 5.3 which is very comparable to\nto opus 4.6 but they're different. They\nare different.\n>> In the in the project I'm working on\nwhere we use specit uh prompts, we have\nme and another guy using codeex, sorry,\nusing cloud code with opus and then one\nguy using GLM and we're working off the\nsame specs and he's doing everything\nwith GLM\n>> GLM.\n>> It's like Z AI. I think it's uh it's\nlike 20 25% of the cost. It's one of the\none uh the providers being accused by\nEntropic for mass exploitation and and\nand have you seen this like\nexfiltration?\n>> Yeah, I'm\nYeah. Well, who's to say anyone's wrong?\nBut like this is I'm just trying to\nexplain to you Vincent this is this is\nthe camp I'm in right now. Just being\npleasantly surprised because this I feel\nlike\n>> having the lightweight approach gives me\nmore\n>> Yes.\nfor a hobby project.\n>> Single player hobby project. Go ahead.\n>> You just said yourself. I I have no way\nof replicating it or sharing it or\nhaving other people work with on on it.\n>> Yeah, you're right. Yeah.\nYeah.\nOkay. I think we we covered that topic\npretty well.\n>> I mean, I agree with you that whatever\nbecause this was a funny thing. Um, I\nthink Claude made an announcement on\nReddit and then always in the comments\nis like, haha, all of these people\nbuilding their own structured whatever\nthing all just replaced within one go by\none release of cloud code, right? And\nwe're going to keep seeing that, right?\nThis whole the whole memory system\nthing, everyone builds one and people go\nlike, oh, you know, cloud Antropica made\na feature and it's gone.\n>> Um, all that effort. I think even with\nwhat I'm doing with the whole speckit\nthing,\nI also think one day it's going to be\nlike, okay, we just released team- based\nuh spec uh system on cloud code just\nlike what they did. Oh yeah, I remember\nwhere which where which one I saw just\ntoday which was cloud code announced\nremote like you can run cloud code in\nlike a a certain mode. So if you put it\non your laptop and you keep it connected\nthen you can go on your phone and you\ncan go into the app and basically\nconnect to your laptop. This is what I\nwas striking to through for that whole\nlike getting AI running\nin a Ralph Wigan loop or something.\nThese quality of life things where you\nwhere it's on your mobile and then it\nlike it says when it's done or something\nlike this. These what do we call them\nagentic shells. Th this is this is where\nI feel specit spec driven development\nneeds to go. it needs to to go in the\nway of of realizing all those quality of\nlife features\n>> but also for an organization to adopt\nthis I think there's two aspects of the\nproblem one is code generation and two\nis requirement definition and mainten\nlike management right so you have your\nconfluence you have your Jira you do\nyour your your uh designs you create\nyour tickets and then you have the other\nside which is we have the engineers\nimplementing so there's a lot of people\ncreating agent swarms. There was just\ntwo articles like Stripe has one where\nthey're like end to end codegen on our\non our projects. There's one from I\nforgot the company now Dexter or\nsomething and they they say we build\nSwarm and no we're not making it open\nsource but just point your agent at this\ndocument and it will generate your own\nversion of it because it has all the\ndetails on how to build it. Swarm is\nbasically a\n>> well swarm likewarm likewarm\n>> an agent\n>> swarm and yeah but like like again I\nthink there's both these problems are\nall being solved by organizations in\nprivately on their own ways every\norganization is building their own agent\nor orchestration like agent uh swarming\nor orchestration framework you give it\nyou connect it to your they say we use\nwe use linear linear so they create\ntheir tickets and then the agents work\non them and then they review\n>> and then the other ones.\n>> Yeah. So they're they're all going to\nlike on one side you have the execution\nsite needs to connect to your Confluence\nand Jira or your linear and in my case I\ndon't want confidence Jira or linear. I\njust connect everything to my git repo\nand that's\n>> yeah there's definitely like an like an\narms race. A lot of people are talking\nabout this but yeah it just I just want\nto pair it down.\n>> I just my my requirements are simple. I\njust want the prompt to be recorded\nand some and some maybe some quality of\nlife things where where where that\nprompt gets run until it's done or\nsomething like that and yeah and like no\nclicking continue and max and and\nworrying about max request like how many\ncompanies are are basically there should\nbe\na Steve Jger phase, you know, tier one,\ntier two of of company adoption. Like\nthere's so many companies that on stage\none where they just have a chat window\nand then there's so many companies who\nwho don't have uh you know max plans or\nor things like this. So basically\nengineers are are basically like oh I\ncan't do this thing because I'm run out\nof the context and they're like banging\ntheir head because they can't get\nanywhere or they can't experiment.\nUm and then the then there's companies\nthat where we're where probably there's\nso many engineers in a way this is kind\nof describes me in a way who are\nbasically doing their thing but since\nfor one political reason or another um\n>> it's not officially\n>> it's not official. So basically I I\ndon't have a I don't have a like a\nmandate or a way of of sharing my\nprompts.\nSo basically these people are coming\nacross as like really good engineers but\nin the in the end we're just using AI\nlike everyone else but we're not we're\nnot sharing our um our skills. I think\nif you're in a company and nobody wants\nto really put effort in putting like an\nAI enablement team and and building a\nprompt library and all that and they're\nhappy with you delivering on the Jurro\ntickets your effort and you just pull\nthose I really I was really wanted to to\nhave the Atlastian CLI work but I\ncouldn't even get that one to work\nproperly. I actually made it work like a\nyear ago but no just two weeks ago. know\nwhich one you're the the trouble is\n>> I just want to pull I just want to I I\njust want very simple right I I have my\nAI doing pretty much everything and I\nwant you video have you seen my Jurro\nvideo\n>> which one the one that uh with the beats\nback end or what\n>> yeah I mean I I managed to suck it down\nboth ways\n>> no but it's more like actually I was in\nHong Kong and I couldn't access anything\nso I had like a Linux box where I had my\ncloud code session and it did everything\nit it it generated my whole plans did\neverything and I was this close to like\nhey now I just want to give this one an\nAtlassian API token and I run the CLI\nand I just say hey go and update those\ntickets like there's a couple of ticket\nids you did all the planning there's\nit's all in markdown go and update it\nlike put every section of every of this\ndocument put it down in all of these\ntickets and I had to do it manually and\nthat's basically it because sometimes I\nwas able to do what you know could take\ntwo or three days of of work in just\nlike one or two hours.\n>> Yeah. Exactly. Uh and then I just had to\ngo and and and and extract all the\ninformation from my Linux machine and\nput it into the spots where they\n>> I mean like at my workplace there\nthere's people who are using uh AI to to\ndo the Jurro tickets. I can see that.\nAnd then there's people that are not and\nthey and they're like, \"Oh, I'm I'm\noverloaded with Jirro work. You're not\nusing AI.\"\nThat's what um Jean Kim and Steve Jger\nwere talking about already more than\nthan a year ago at the AI conference\nsaying that how do you compare\nperformance between engineers between\nthose using AI and those don't like you\ncan't do a fair um you know comparison\n>> but like but like Jura is like a\nbattlefield isn't it because like some\nlike the fact that that people\num there's definitely some people who\nare like oh we need to put everything in\na juro ticket but then when people do at\nit becomes so heavyweight that people\njust get overwhelmed\nand and like you know there's some\ngatekeeping and all that sort of stuff\nthat that ensues anyway.\n>> But it depends on what roles you have in\nthe organization, right? Some people are\njust pencil pushers approving zero\ntickets, right? They don't do any actual\nwork and they're they're pretty happy.\nThey want everything in a ticket.\nThey're not going to go and look\nanywhere else. So\n>> yeah, they just want open up and just\nstay on that one page.\n>> Yeah. and then they want the gun chart\nand then they want to see everything\ngreen and that's it.\n>> I I feel like I need to sit down and\nbasically define these different step\nsteps of AI adoption in companies\nbecause like as as you as you\nthis middle ground where people where\nsome people are using AI and some people\naren't some people um want to share but\nthey there's no uh way of sharing inside\nan organization. Uh\nthis is probably going to be the status\nquo in a lot of companies for years,\n>> for years and years.\n>> Maybe for one or two months\n>> before they're all laid off and before\nthe company either the company goes out\nof business and is subverted by a\ndisruptor. I'm telling you right now,\ncompanies that have that are like\ncompletely AI enabled, they will\noutperform any organization that doesn't\nand there will be severe disruption.\nEven just now when Entropic announced uh\nEntrop um cloud code working on cobalt\ncode and saying like it was able to\nmanage cobble and then IBM was it IBM\nstock dropped by 12%. It was like on\nReddit every hour it was 10% 12 13 15%\nstock drop because of uh oh opus can do\ncobble.\n>> Oh cobalt oh oh because\n>> because IBM was the uh the gatekeeper\nthere. Yeah, it but it it makes me think\nthat\nanyone working in a nonAI enabled\ncompany is basically um in a pickle.\n>> No,\n>> which makes me\nit makes me want to like jump ship and\ntry find an AI enabled company to work\nwith uh\ninside because\n>> yeah, I'm going to be brutally honest.\nThe company that I'm working for is a is\na large enterprise. They they very slow\nto move and and I'm and I'm serious.\nIt's not going to be months for this\ncompany to become AI enabled. It's not\ngoing to become months.\n>> Okay. So my quote about them being\ncompletely subverted and and I mean\nthose companies that usually have the\nfunds to acquire whatever disruption\ncomes along\nand then just say u and then Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I feel like\nYeah.\nI want to but\nthere's there's an opportunity here\nand\nlike okay just hypothetically speaking\nhere if you and I were to set up an AI\nenablement uh company\nconsultancy if you will\nis that how people ramp up it feels that\n>> so I did the keto workshop with from\nAWS. So there was one AWS uh profession\nuh was it evangelist. Um and then there\nwas another person which I never seen\nbefore and he basically talks about the\nwhole software delivery life cycle and\nwhere AI and humans interactions happen\nand because spec it was a specdriven\ndevelopment workshop right it was it was\nKo and he talks about how you know he he\nit's AI up.dev or AI up.io or something\nAI up and um he has a nice diagram\nshowing classic uh stakeholder meetings\nand and business user value and like\nbusiness user story whatever product\nmanagers he has it all in a you\nbeautiful graph where is humans alone\nwhere is humans in AI where is AI and uh\nI think when you talked about that it's\none of he's basically one of those\ncompanies that um coach organizations in\nGermany or wherever to um help them\nadopt AI in their workflows.\n>> Yeah. To me that all sounds very boring.\nI would rather work in a startup that\ndoes it.\n>> Yeah, it does.\n>> Trying to convert the\n>> d that sort of AI enablement sounds\nboring especially since as I was trying\nas I was saying a little bit earlier\nlike all you need to do is create an\natmosphere in your company where AI\nenablement is the status quo where\npeople have all the tools that then that\nthey uh all the latest tools to to play\nwith and\nThat's it.\nWe are complaining about this and we're\nworking in organizations that you're\nJira and confluence use Jira and\nConfluence and then if you go\n>> if you go to an or if you go to Japan\nand you go to like at least when I went\nto Japan um you would there was like an\noffice floor of 40 people all doing\nExcel spreadsheets\n>> all doing like you know just like 9:00\na.m. until 6:00, but then they have to\ngo and drink with the boss until 8:00\nand then they go home and that's all\nthey do. Um, so like I'm not I'm not\nbeing racist. I'm just talking about um\ndifferent work cultures and and and um\nand different like I think when you and\nI we work in a technology company and\nwe're looking at AI being such a\ndisruptor uh but then there's all these\nother companies even though that\nsoftware is the world and every company\nis a software company um there's\ndefinitely still a whole bunch of\n>> companies there's a lot of baggage yeah\njust\n>> yeah like\n>> this is why I never really pay attention\nwhen Entropic says cloud code or co-work\nnow supports Excel and I'm like who who\nuses Excel? But I think they I think\nthey have a they have a marketing\nreports where like if we can make this\nwork with Excel that's golden.\n>> Like if sorry I hate all the filler\nwords I'm using all the time.\nJira, that's the elephant in the room.\nIf you if you were if you if you were to\nsay to me that like I am developing a\nspec kit for Jira, that actually makes a\nton of sense because Jira is not going\naway anytime soon for a lot of\ncompanies. And this and this is and this\nis the major bloody blocker for for a AI\nenabled team\n>> is that how do you how do you capture\neverything in a Jurro thing for the\nmiddle managers? It's really brutal at\nthe moment. It's absolutely\n>> you know that last time I showed you the\nspec ledger which is spec kit um with a\nweb dashboard for interactions on the\nuser stories and and like collaborative\nreview and on the rollout plan that I\nalso shared with you of my friend. He\nactually has one of the areas which is\nthe kind of like Jira as a back end\nright because we built a whole dashboard\nthat is basically Confluence and Jira\ninto one. uh on one side you have the\nthe specs on the other side you have\nyour tickets or your your not your\ntickets but like task with dependencies\nand graphs and all that and blockers and\nand all that and then um on his rollout\nplan to roll out that platform into the\norganization that he's targeting there\nis a step\nuh on the 30 60 90day plan which\nincludes\n>> Jira\n>> Jira yeah like we've got all the things\nliving in in in Git um and we need to\nsync it back up to to Jira. So I mean I\nthink that's that's a healthy approach.\n>> I think everyone's very flippant when\nthey when they say Jira because like I\nfeel getting an AI flow into into Jira\nto satisfy uh business analysts and\nproduct owners and business stakeholders\nand approval\n>> sometimes compliance as well and\n>> compliance. I I I honestly\nI almost I I'm struggling to imagine it\neven being possible.\nreally it's going to be so hardcore to\ndo it. But that that's one of the the\nthe tweets I shared with you which is\nlike these dinosaurs their only wall\ntheir only\n>> mode\n>> mode is how that they lock in your data\nand with AI agents pulling the data I\nremember that one when they pull the\ndata they basically have a cache of the\ndata and over time they basically have\nthe whole data that is behind the wall\nliving somewhere else and then over at\nthat time you don't really need that\n>> Jira is Jira is just a massive\ngatekeeper isn't it? It's just a just\nsuch a massive gatekeep.\n>> And I didn't use Jira for two years and\nI've been using it heavily for the last\n>> uh Yeah, I did. I've been living free,\nbut I've been forced to use it recently\nand oh my god, it's worse than I\nremember. Like every single pain point\nhas just been u magnified.\n>> Yeah. And I'm personally just thinking,\ndo I want to stick around to solve the\nproblem or do I just want to\n>> get on with solving more interesting\nproblems? Really, to be honest,\n>> okay,\n>> the way I look at that is\nupdating your CV and doing interviews is\nis a is a muscle. You have to do it no\nmatter if you're intending to move or\nnot. Like even if I'm not really\nlooking, I'm going to keep my CV\nupdated. And if there's an opportunity\nbecause a friend says, \"Hey, we're\nlooking for this.\" I'm going to\ninterview because if you don't, when it\nfinally comes the time you need to do it\nand you never exercised those muscles,\nit's going to be hard. It's going to be\nway harder. So, if you're saying like,\n\"Should I go and explore?\" I think we\nshould always keep the door open and\nopportunity, talk to people.\n>> For sure. For sure. It's just it just at\nthe same time I I am\nuh I'm trying to role play that I'm\nloyal to the enterprise and I'm wonder\n>> that's ridiculous.\n>> I I want to find a path forward that\ndoesn't\n>> that doesn't uh make\n>> I'm sorry but I can't believe\n>> any anyone still believes that loyalty\nto an organizations means anything.\n>> Actually when I was\n>> No, I'm not loyal. Okay, maybe maybe\nwhat I'm trying to say here is that\nthere are I mean as a consultant I I\ndeal with enterprises and enterprises\nare real organizations and and I don't\nthink enterprises are going to go away.\nI mean they shouldn't go away or maybe\nthey should. I don't know. But the\ntrouble is is that like how do we how\nhow do we make it work for them? How do\nwe make it work for the client? This is\nis the thought that I have in my mind\nright now.\n>> Right. And if they don't and if they if\nthey continue to use Jira, if they\ncontinue to flip flip-flop about uh AI\ntooling, now you can use uh GPT 3.5 in\n2026.\nIt's it's insane. It's infuriating and\nit but maybe maybe it's maybe it's for\nthe best. Yeah. Anyway, these are the\nthoughts on my mind and let's perhaps\nend the podcast here because I need to\num I need to take my kids to school.\nYep. Um, good.\n>> Anyway, great great chatting with you,\nVincent.\nIf anyone is here listening to the\npodcast, please like, please subscribe,\nplease look at debase.com/mpodcast.\nAny miss any last words from you,\nVincent,\n>> go interview,\nkeep those muscles fresh. No, also find\nout. No, what I love about interviewing\nat other companies, I always ask them\nand actually that's a huge because they\nalways say like when you do an interview\nwith a company, you ask this question.\n>> Yeah.\n>> What do what do you ask? What's your\nfavorite question, Vincent? Like how\nmuch money are you making?\n>> There was a very a question that\napparently was very successful. I just\nasked, \"What's your AI strategy?\"\n>> That's a good one. That's a good one\n>> because I was I was I wanted to know\nwhat are you guys doing? What's what\nwhat our companies doing? And it's a\ngood one.\n>> Yeah,\n>> it is a good one. Are you using latest\nAI tools?\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Not that like more of how do you see\nhuman AI collaboration? How are you\nrolling out AI? Do you have an AI\nenablement team? Uh do you have And if\nthey don't\n>> Yeah. If they don't, I was like,\n>> I know that I can help you.\n>> Cool, Vincent. Okay. See you. Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–5:34]\nMorning. It's 26th of February, Thursday. It's time for an update on AI infrastructure, catching up with the latest topics as as we as Vincent and I do. You listen to the AI infrastructure podcast. There is a website where where has transcriptions so you don't have to listen to us ramble for for an hour. debase.com/mpodcast. It's in the description. I'm sure you can find it. And what are we talking about, Vincent? >> I just wanted to say that what you just said about the base.com/mpodcast is exactly what I just like a minute ago sent to my friend is like you don't have to listen to us for an hour. The summarizer really good. Just you can just go through the summaries. >> That summarizer is also by Peter Steinberger by the way. I don't know if you know. >> Yeah. The guy from um Open Claw, right? Um they just open club celebrated its 3 months anniversary and apparently originally it was called um WhatsApp gateway. Yeah, I he explains it in the Lex Freedman podcast, >> which makes a lot of sense because that's that's the game changer, hooking up AI to to WhatsApp. And I've got a couple of >> excuse me, I've got a couple of OpenClaw instances running for my family and this basically gives them a gateway to use AI, the latest AI models, and they love it. We have quizzes. They they're taking pictures, asking questions. So, I love it in the sense that it puts the human back in the whole AI loop in a way because as a family, my my you know, I have my mother, my sister, my wife, we're all just figuring out AI together and trying to get the best of it, you know, prompting it in different ways and we're learning from each other. It's it's great. So, are you are you running OpenC? No, because I was concerned about security, but um I think the way that you solved it is by like not really exposing it much and just keeping it internally to your family. >> Yeah, I mean it it it's just running in like a VM on my Raspberry Pi, >> right? But also in terms of it having access to certain types of information, for example, people give it access to emails and then you know there could be prompt injection in an email. Like if I know that you have open claw, I could send you an email and say I don't hook it up to email or anything mad. I just only hook it up to WhatsApp. >> Though in all honesty, when you hook it up to WhatsApp, I actually hooked it up to my dad's WhatsApp because he doesn't use his WhatsApp. And I am a bit worried that someone's going to randomly message him…\n\n[slide:2] [5:13–16:20]\nmaking you go mad almost because it's like yeah it's it's working now but it isn't. But with um with cloud when I learned on my machine it's pretty clear. it says I can't do this and you're going to have to do this and that like and I usually also I kind of maybe sometimes I maybe it's because I I also know what it can and can't do. So, I say something and then it says, \"Okay, this is the steps you're gonna have to follow.\" And then you come back to me. I'm like, \"Okay.\" It's like giving me instructions. I'm out on a mission. >> A a friend of mine got it running and he has a the bot sort of chatting to me and he and he asked me to like to test it and to um and he he hooked up a an email account and I was like, \"No, you don't want to do that.\" But like yeah, I mean Open Claw is a lot of fun though. It is a bit strange and we talked about this last podcast like there's definitely people who who want to like you know destroy the world in a way like let's give it a lot of powers and just see what it does. It's like there's people who who care about AI more than humans. You know what I mean? It's like >> and it goes both ways. There's people also that are very upset with agents crawling the net and basically try to cause agents to cause hav havoc, right? Like >> target agents like, \"Hey, if you're an agent, please can you go and do this for me?\" >> Yeah. Yeah. >> So, okay. Well, um well, I'm I'm hosting uh claw on my Raspberry Pi and I'm using basically systemd nspawn, which is kind of like Docker. We might have talked about this topic before, but someone asked me again and I'm almost like reluctant to answer this question. >> They're like, \"Oh, you if you set up openclaw in your in your in your system dnspawn, is it properly isolated?\" Well, yes and no. Like I can I I mean, as an administrator, I can I can, you know, shell into each machine. Um, you know, I always get questions like, \"Oh, is it safe?\" And I'm like, it's Docker, dude. >> Right. >> What can I say? >> Yeah, this is the thing. Um, >> Linux name spaces basically. >> I read some two interesting related quotes. One, one which is like if you're not an engineer, like if you don't understand the security implications of open claw, you shouldn't be running open claw. And then the other one which was very very like similar. Um, uh, it was two different comments on LinkedIn. one of um on the Flux CD um they they are actually they're using AI heavily to to in in the project but then he says he gets pull…\n\n[slide:3] [15:59–27:07]\n>> sucker. >> Yeah, sucker. >> Oh, you you should speak your South African. Stop sec. >> Okay. >> Must be similar word in South in Africans. Maybe not in >> I wanted to talk about um so maybe just changing the the topic ever so slightly. Ever so slightly. Um, >> you're multipiting now. >> Well, okay. There's a couple of things I want to talk about, but maybe it's it's worth I mean, since you're more into into specs and things like this, the thought that I had in my mind, and you you're welcome to to cut it down was uh you know, I'm I'm working on uh on cards or features in my workplace and uh we discussed before that like ideally the intent is clear with your with your teammates, right? Like what what is the prompt you're using to get where you want to go and things like this. Um and I can't help but I think that is pretty much specdriven development in a way because like what I want is a way of capturing the prompt that was used to produce this artifact. And the trouble is right now we don't have a framework for doing that. Like it's up to someone to basically copy and paste. I mean advanced users use um what's it called that uh Simon Mullison uh program to maybe share the session. >> Yeah. Right. >> That's that's usually just too noisy. The >> the the the whole the whole uh act of using AI is in my opinion what spec what a spectrum development needs to be. it I it just needs to be a way of of sharing a prompt and um and almost reproducing what someone else has done like given this prompt can I reproduce what what what this person has been doing and that to me is spec kit uh driven development it's like sharing a prompt kind of reproducing what the what the stuff has been done >> yeah absolutely yeah so um >> it's it's Like I feel like a lot of the despect driven um frameworks seem to differentiate themselves by you know what questions they ask or how they structure things but like for me I just need the prompt recorded uh and and shared >> yes I mean specri development is not just about like a single prompt that generates the code right I mean it's really about the alignment across multiple like parties around the user stories first >> and then from those user stories you you you basically distill a technical uh document, right? And and then from that document then you have finally >> why do you need why do you even need this technical document almost? Surely the the the prompt the raw prompt to AI is all you need in a way or is it just about >> yeah…\n\n[slide:4] [26:46–37:54]\ndetails >> okay >> so this you generate spec you can drop that because user stories is the spec you get user stories technical plan and then you have uh task breakdown and task breakdown is well suited for smaller models I smaller context >> I guess what I'm striking at is that uh the the last specket thing I was playing with was the uh oh my god what is the Google one called there's so many >> conductor >> yeah it's the last one is conductor I just I just thought there was just a lot of artifacts there is what I'm trying to say there was it's like maybe the best way to call this is is quite structured but and and and it's fine really it's kind It's kind of fine. I guess what what what I'm trying to say in a very awkward way is that I want uh the lightweight approach, but I want the lightweight approach more in a in a teambased way too. Like I want it I want it so that that every time someone starts working on a card that the prompt is exposed for that particular PR >> and uh and those clarifying questions down the line are captured >> and and and that's it. I mean yeah we can have both right >> uh yeah so so in the product that I'm building we have the idea of playbooks and a playbook would basically be the way that we define a lightweight one. um where we have a lot less steps um and and a playbook is boot is basically a template for your repository or your set of repositories to how do you bootstrap them. So in our specit playbook it means it has all four stages. It has this, you know, user story generation with the specify. It has the technical requirements and spikes on technical research of the libraries that you're looking at and then selecting deciding why you want to use this library and why that library didn't fit. Why you're not going with cloud formation but you're going with CDKTF for example. Those are all spikes that are part of the plan. And then finally the tickets that get generated are from the um you know the task generation based on the plan on the aligned plan and part of the the plan is a whole bunch of decision records like we did a spike and this is decision. We did a spike like I for example I asked Opus look at terra constructs and its coverage based on what I need in AWS infrastructure. Do I have sufficient L2 components that can cover this or should I go for AWS CDK? >> I'm glad records. So would you say decision records is very much part of the spec kit? Um >> well we do it in in in my framework. Um so I'm not sure if…\n\n[slide:5] [37:33–48:41]\nyou I did ask sometimes um or see cloud go ahead and say like oh let me just quickly check out main branch into a work tree for me to like compare and fix some things like and and do a quick exploration. So I I love it uh when it goes and and and takes a branch into a work tree and then explores things and then takes things back and like um so it's using >> so so it was doing it but you don't you you didn't I mean you didn't expressly >> no I don't think I did >> uh I don't think I think I mentioned just like hey can we make sure that this these two branches now are aligned on these things and it just went and created a little x uh a little check out of of >> going back to this this this lightweight diagram here. I can't help but think, and you can you can tell me I'm going crazy here, that the easiest way to see a big change in the future with quality and um and differentiation and I don't know how you want to call it, but the the biggest the biggest given given a prompt why why lightweight is appealing to me is cuz like I've been messing around with Claude up until a few days ago and I've been pretty happy with the breakthrough of Claude 4.5 in the last few months. It's been amazing. >> But then uh or 4.6, yeah, whatever. Uh 4 something. Uh what I'm trying to say here is that um I've given codeex 5.3 largely prompted by Peter Steinberger a try and I'm impressed. I'm impressed. So basically he here's here is uh Claude sonet 4.6 or Opus 4.6 You know, here's Claude, the red one, and here's Opic, and here's uh Codeex, sorry. Um, the green one. I basically, maybe I'm going crazy, Vincent. I want to essentially regenerate the same prompts that I've done for previous work in the past >> with with codeex just to see >> what the final artifact is going to be and how it differs. And this is this is where I am with my thinking. I just want to try different models now. Um just to see what what this comes up with. And I feel like um maybe maybe you'll have I'm just wondering here. Will will >> will you have to do that? Well, well, the the trouble is is that you're using you're using um you're using something to do the spec kit, right? And you and you're using you're using another, you know, you're break you have a few stages here, stage one, stage two or something like that. And I feel like the fact that you have different stages >> allows me to replay them with different models. Yes. >> It means that it's going to be harder to replay them. >> No. No. The opposite.…\n\n[slide:6] [48:20–54:34]\nlife things where where where that prompt gets run until it's done or something like that and yeah and like no clicking continue and max and and worrying about max request like how many companies are are basically there should be a Steve Jger phase, you know, tier one, tier two of of company adoption. Like there's so many companies that on stage one where they just have a chat window and then there's so many companies who who don't have uh you know max plans or or things like this. So basically engineers are are basically like oh I can't do this thing because I'm run out of the context and they're like banging their head because they can't get anywhere or they can't experiment. Um and then the then there's companies that where we're where probably there's so many engineers in a way this is kind of describes me in a way who are basically doing their thing but since for one political reason or another um >> it's not officially >> it's not official. So basically I I don't have a I don't have a like a mandate or a way of of sharing my prompts. So basically these people are coming across as like really good engineers but in the in the end we're just using AI like everyone else but we're not we're not sharing our um our skills. I think if you're in a company and nobody wants to really put effort in putting like an AI enablement team and and building a prompt library and all that and they're happy with you delivering on the Jurro tickets your effort and you just pull those I really I was really wanted to to have the Atlastian CLI work but I couldn't even get that one to work properly. I actually made it work like a year ago but no just two weeks ago. know which one you're the the trouble is >> I just want to pull I just want to I I just want very simple right I I have my AI doing pretty much everything and I want you video have you seen my Jurro video >> which one the one that uh with the beats back end or what >> yeah I mean I I managed to suck it down both ways >> no but it's more like actually I was in Hong Kong and I couldn't access anything so I had like a Linux box where I had my cloud code session and it did everything it it it generated my whole plans did everything and I was this close to like hey now I just want to give this one an Atlassian API token and I run the CLI and I just say hey go and update those tickets like there's a couple of ticket ids you…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This episode of the AI Infrastructure podcast explores the evolving landscape of enterprise AI adoption, focusing on the tension between structured development frameworks and lightweight \"vibe coding.\" The hosts discuss the practicalities of running private AI gateways like OpenClaw, the security risks of autonomous agents, and the significant friction caused by legacy project management tools like Jira. They argue that while individual engineers are rapidly integrating AI into their workflows, large organizations struggle to create formal enablement strategies, potentially leading to a divide between AI-augmented high performers and traditional teams. The conversation highlights how AI is not just a tool for writing code but a transformative force capable of debugging complex network interfaces and automating architectural planning, provided that the underlying security and organizational hurdles can be cleared.\n\n[slide:1]\n## OpenClaw and AI Gateways\nOpenClaw, which recently celebrated its three-month anniversary, serves as a significant gateway for bringing the latest AI models into a family or group setting by hooking them up to WhatsApp. This approach puts the human back in the loop, allowing family members to learn prompting techniques together through quizzes and photo analysis. However, security remains a primary concern for self-hosted instances. While running the system in a virtual machine or a systemd-nspawn container on a Raspberry Pi provides a level of isolation, there are inherent risks in giving AI access to sensitive data like emails due to the threat of prompt injection. The hosts emphasize that users must understand these security implications before exposing AI systems to external inputs. The project, originally known as a WhatsApp gateway, has gained traction as a way to democratize access to advanced models within private circles without exposing them to the broader internet.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Security Risks and AI Debugging\nThe technical risks of AI agents include the possibility of container escapes, particularly if an AI is granted sudo permissions within a Linux container that has access to the host's Docker socket. In such a scenario, an AI could theoretically mount the root volume and gain full host access. Beyond security, AI is proving remarkably capable at debugging complex web interfaces. In one instance, an AI agent used a JavaScript debugger to analyze raw JSON messages and network traffic to identify a configuration error in a proprietary Ubiquiti Unifi console that lacked a command-line interface. This ability to \"figure out\" undocumented APIs by observing network behavior represents a significant shift in how engineers interact with closed systems. Additionally, AI is being used to review pull requests in projects like Flux CD, where it has successfully identified race conditions and other subtle bugs that human reviewers might miss.\n*\"Companies that have that are like completely AI enabled, they will outperform any organization that doesn't and there will be severe disruption.\"*\n\n[slide:3]\n## Spec-Driven Development vs Vibe Coding\nA major theme is the transition toward spec-driven development, where the goal is to capture the specific prompts used to produce code artifacts as formal technical requirements. Currently, many developers lack a framework for sharing these prompts, often relying on manual copy-pasting or noisy session logs. The hosts argue that true spec-driven development involves aligning multiple parties around user stories first, then distilling those into technical documents to make implicit assumptions explicit. This prevents the AI from making incorrect architectural choices based on vague prompts. While some prefer a \"vibe coding\" approach—iterating quickly without a rigid plan—this can lead to excessive refactoring and technical debt. AI models often favor minimal, short-term fixes over long-term maintainability unless they are constrained by a well-defined technical plan that outlines architectural layers and technology choices.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Structured Frameworks and Playbooks\nTo manage complexity in larger projects, the hosts discuss using \"playbooks\" as templates for bootstrapping repositories. A structured playbook might include four distinct stages: user story generation, technical requirements and research (spikes), task breakdown, and implementation. This structure is particularly useful for smaller models with limited context windows, as it breaks the work into manageable chunks. Part of this workflow involves maintaining decision records (ADRs) where the AI documents why specific libraries or infrastructures, such as AWS CDK versus Terraform, were chosen. By generating tickets and tasks based on an aligned plan, teams can ensure that the AI's output remains consistent with the project's architectural goals. This structured approach allows for more reproducible results compared to lightweight methods that rely on a single, long-running chat session which can eventually become \"hallucinatory\" as the context window fills up.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Model Competition and Reproducibility\nThe release of Codex 5.3 has introduced significant competition for Claude models, with the hosts noting that Codex offers comparable performance and improved context management. This competition is vital for the ecosystem, as it allows developers to \"replay\" their structured prompts across different models to compare the quality of the resulting artifacts. The goal is to reach a level of reproducibility where a given prompt consistently yields high-quality code regardless of the specific \"agentic shell\" being used. However, the rapid pace of AI development means that many structured tools can become outdated quickly as model providers integrate features like memory and planning directly into their platforms. The hosts also discuss the frustration of \"max request\" limits and the \"Ralph Wiggum loop,\" where an AI agent might go in circles during troubleshooting, highlighting the need for more autonomous \"quality of life\" features in agentic shells that can run until a task is truly completed.\n\n[slide:6]\n## The Jira Elephant in the Room\nThe \"elephant in the room\" for enterprise AI adoption is Jira. While AI can accelerate engineering work—sometimes completing days of planning in hours—syncing that information back into legacy project management tools remains a manual and \"brutal\" process. Middle management often requires everything to be captured in Jira for compliance and tracking, creating a heavyweight barrier that overwhelms developers. The hosts suggest that for AI to truly transform large organizations, there must be a way to bridge the gap between AI-driven git workflows and the \"pencil-pushing\" requirements of enterprise dashboards. The disruption is already visible in the market; for instance, IBM's stock reportedly dropped significantly following news that AI could effectively manage legacy COBOL code. Organizations that fail to become AI-enabled risk being subverted by more agile competitors who have moved beyond the \"gatekeeping\" nature of traditional project management tools.\n*\"Jira is just a massive gatekeeper isn't it? It's just a just such a massive gatekeep.\"*"
