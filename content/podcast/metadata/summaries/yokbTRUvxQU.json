    "content": "Transcript:\nfree tech shirts.\nOkay. Optimizing AI workflows with spec\nbeat pets and beats. H Beats, baby.\nCould have fixed that one.\nI did I did see the typo at some point,\nbut I forgot. Good point. Should update\nthat.\n>> I share my workflow building a project\ncalled the grid, which involves a\nTerraform state back end. I discuss how\nI've been using and modifying specket\nfor a more advanced cloud core cloud.\n>> Yeah, I haven't updated. It's all\n>> is this generated auto by AI?\n>> Yeah, Loom. It's I'm paying for Loom.\nAnd so Loom automatically does the\ntranscripts. It's a pretty easy editing\nexperience.\n>> Oh, that's we need to do transcripts for\nthe podcast. That was my next little\nepic.\n>> Hey,\n>> I wanted to share with you my AI\nworkflow. So, I'm currently building\nsomething called the grid, which is a\n>> I always find when people show their\ntoolbar,\nit's a bit distracting.\n>> Yeah. And there's too many like um icons\non there like bookmarks. I also noticed\nit when I was rewatching.\n>> Command B. I'm always conscious.\n>> It's like it's like it's got to be a\nname for it.\n>> I know a terform state back end. It's\nnot very hip, but it's not a trivial um\nproject. So it requires a little bit\nmore advanced cloud code usage than just\ntraffic.\n>> I can't I can't help but notice this\njur.\n>> You can I never watch myself at at at\none. I always watch myself at 1.5 and\nwhen I'm edit editing I watch myself at\ntwo double speed.\n>> I find it interesting that you call opus\na planning agent.\n>> You will have a couple of\n>> a lot of people do. Yeah. Then\n>> so you you were saying that like when\nSpectit updates you update, right? But\n>> yeah, so I have a local copy of the\nprompts and I go through their change\nlog and I pull in uh and try to merge my\nchanges together with theirs. For\nexample, one of them is originally\nSpeckit generated very nonsense branch\nnames, but then they modified the script\nto um automatically like LLM create like\na nice branch name. Do you ever PR back\nsome of your suggestions back to them or\nit's like you've personalized this or\nsomething?\n>> I am thinking about it. I'm not sure. I\nI I really think it would be nice if I\ncould contribute it back and align mine\nmore with upstream. So, but I didn't\nnotice a lot of effort um lately on the\nproject. That's why I haven't um\ncontributed it back.\n>> Oh, okay. Okay.\nin my in my employer.\nI'm I'm reluctant to to name it just\nbecause I don't want to get myself in\nhot water, but we have like quite a lot\nof interesting material about how to to\nlaunch. I think we call them inceptions.\nI think uh it's it it's just how to to\nto gather requirements, NFRs. There's\nthere's a lot\nand and I can't help but think it must\nit must match well to this sort of\nstuff.\n>> This is cool. This is cool. I'm just I'm\njust thinking aloud that like uh in my\nworkplace we always have to do an ADR\nfor for things. What I don't like is\ndoing the ADR\nbefore we implement it.\nI don't know if you have any thoughts\nabout that, but I mean an arch\narchitecture decision record. Okay, this\nthis is a spec. You you're talking about\nspecs. an arch architecture decision\nrecord isn't quite the same. But anyway,\nit's just a thought at the moment. So I\njust had maybe you can dive a bit on\nthat because I just had a call as well\nuh with someone who's building more like\na multi- aent system to like when cloud\nhas completed some work kick off a\nreview agent or one or more review\nagents to get feedback and I was like\nwhy do you do the review and and\n[clears throat] then this examples he\ngave me was like\n>> the review agent needs to validate that\nthe implementation matches the user like\nuh story or the business value and I'm\nlike actually speckit inverses that and\nI feel like is it is speckit more\nwaterfall like than agile because you're\nmaking a lot of decisions up front\nyou're doing like a a resource\n>> research but I also think and I think\nthis so yes speckit is doing anversion\nof like making sure that the\nspecifications are defined first um but\nwhat speckit also does is\nit's like 70% planning 30% and um agents\nwriting code. So you do the check-in of\nthe of the specifications, the user data\nand all that and the tech research and\nthen I imagine you go off on another\nbranch, you let the agents write all the\ncode and then if you encounter any\nissues with that design, you just throw\naway because it's so easy uh and so\ncheap to generate code and you go back\nto the research and you're like, \"Hey,\nwe tried this. We we got stuck there.\nThere's some problems with this design\nbecause course adjusting midway is not\nthat easy.\" like in if I'm in the middle\nand I have like generated 20 tasks and\nthey assume that I've gone down this\npath where this file exists over there\nand that turns out to be a wrong path,\nyou must be able to backtrack. So I\nthink that's something I'm not doing\nright now because I'm trying to course\nadjust. I think specit is kind of agile\nin that way.\n>> I I don't I didn't quite get that. So\nwhen you course adjust are you saying\nthat your initial spec doesn't keep up\nthe specs don't keep up with that course\nadjustment or\n>> yeah if the whole you know idea here\nthat I'm I'm I'm highlighting why I like\nspeckit is that it goes through all of\nthe code and it highlights clearly like\nokay we're going to introduce this\nfeature and it's going to touch these\nfive components in this component we\nhave to change this in that component we\nhave to change that and there's a\ncontract between them, right? So, you\nget very small tasks and you send them\noff into agents to to to complete those\ntasks. When everything comes back, you\nshould, you know, and you're building a\nbridge, you have to meet in the middle,\nright? Not not like and\n>> so so if in the middle one guy was\nsuccessfully building against the\ncontract, but the other guy had like a\nmassive issue, maybe you need to be able\nto step back and course adjust where the\nrest of the plan is like laid out\naccording to that path. So, that's kind\nof like\n>> the hard bit about it. But I think\n>> I think you have the same if you do an\nADR right you you will have gone through\nseveral parts identifies the issues and\nbacktracked right\n>> yeah like the whole point of an ADR is\nto to be honest ADR's arch architecture\ndecision records are are different for\nevery company but the expectation in my\ncurrent gig is that they that you have\nlike three choices you you have your\nthree vendors or whatever your three\nthings and you and you basically\nshow that you that you done some due\ndiligence in comparing the three\noptions.\nSo, it's not quite it's not the same as\na spec, but I I can imagine all feeds\ninto each other because\nyeah, it's anyway, it's that's but\nanother point [snorts] of feedback that\nI got u when I explained the specket um\nworkflow to the guy who's building the\nto Zach who's building the beats uh UI.\nHe he also highlighted to me that in\nagile you will have a retrospective and\nspeckit doesn't have that retrospective\nthe way he understands it right now like\nwhere you go back and adjust the the\nprompt templates to like make sure that\nyou don't go do make those same mistakes\n>> and and then furthermore like specit is\nfor driving AI like I feel like we\nalmost need a speck it for driving\nhumans because like all these workflows\nall these things it's complicated\nWell, is it? Yeah, it is. It is. We're\nall learning here.\n>> We're all learning how to drive the AI\nand like it's it's quite it's not easy\num to keep everyone on board cuz it's\nmoving quite quickly too, you know, like\nlike I mean some of my stakeholders are\nlike non-technical like if if I go\nrampant with the AI, I mean they're not\ngoing to keep up basically.\n[snorts]\n>> Yeah. Y more areas. So one one thing\nthat's come up on my radar a lot is this\nis this term uh pro progressive\ndisclosure when you write these markdown\nfiles\nwould you say they progressively\ndisclosing the the task or how or does\nit even feature in here? I I guess the\nAI is expected to read the whole damn\nthing and the end of Right.\nSo I think that's where um beats comes\nin very nicely which I'm going to\nmention next when I show this 1,300 line\nfile which um it's beats allows the AI\nto stay focused on just um a small\nportion of the of the markdown. I don't\nthink markdown is the best way to\nprogressively\num disclose like the details. I think\nwith Beats you actually get like the\nhigh overview and you can drill down\ninto one issue and then get exactly that\nlike design acceptance criteria\n>> in in the anthropic documentation. I\nthink the I mean they don't say this but\nmy interpretation is that like with the\nskill markdown you you structure your\nmark you you structure your markdown to\nhave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 with the\nrealization that the thing might not get\nto 10 you know but anyway\n>> tasks. So you label them. Interesting.\nSo you must have a reason for labeling\nthem prereec edge status\nvalidation inference web app.\n>> So the the problem was when I was\nplaying with beats I realized that there\nwasn't really a good way to query the\nlist unless you use labels. like you can\nsee the next set of ready tasks but if\nyou have like multiple feature branches\nthen there will be a complete mixture of\ndifferent tasks in that database because\nthey are shared right it's on the root\nof the repo so if you have like multiple\nbranches but you're merging things in um\nthere is actually the beats database is\nshared this is very different between\nspecit which the task file is for one\nfeature but beats is like a central\ndatabase and and I realized you couldn't\nreally query that database case unless\nyou use labels. So labels were the only\nway to like slice and dice the the the\nissues.\n>> Yeah,\n>> fair enough. I guess I'm always thinking\nhierarchically for some reason, you\nknow, like I'm thinking epic feature du\ndu du.\n>> I will show you the the the graph in a\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, I thought you were going to mention\nBD ready, but maybe you're going to do\nthat. I mean, spec implement is BD\nready, right?\nYeah. Um, kind of it's it's you have to\naugment implement with with the next\nsteps to do. I'm I'm actually not using\nBD ready. I'm usually telling it like\nwe're going to work on user story one.\nWe're going to work on user story 2. And\nusually I want the ready to be filtered\ndown to user story one or user story 2.\nSo um they just added that with\ncapability. Before you could not um\nfilter ready by label, but now you can\nand and I updated my prompt as well like\nuse the BD ready but with these label\nfilters.\n>> It's interesting that you use user\nstories for some reason.\nI mean every every every\ncard, every task for me has a user\nstory. But I'm guessing you're using\nuser story as a more of a high level um\na high level feature that you want to\nimplement. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So basically when you run like\nspecify it's going to generate user\nstories and then it's going to create\nfunctional requirements and when I do\nafter I do the research it's going to\ngenerate the tasks and every task must\nbe backed by a functional requirement or\na user story. Right? So every task. So\nwe I I get like epic. Then I have user\nstory which is feature because um beats\nonly has like epic feature and task and\nI map them from specify um feature to\nepic and user story to feature and task\nto task. So\n>> So your task doesn't have a user story.\nIt just has like some like\n>> it's a child of a user story and has the\nlabels of the functional requirements.\n>> Interesting.\n>> Yeah. So you will see that I think when\nwhen we look at the UI like\n>> okay\n>> cuz that's the next step\n>> on the topic of context window I'm I'm\nloving how beads allows me to manage the\ncontext window loving it\nbut in the future the context is is\nbound to grow right and I'm just\nthinking to myself like I'm I'm doing\nall this effort to to to manage the\ncontext more effectively\nif you know tomorrow they they launch\nuh Claude Son 6.0 and it has like\npractically unlimited context.\nAm I like have I just wasted my time is\nis the thought that was running through\nmy mind.\n>> My thought is more more that like\nanthropic is bound to build beats into\ncloud code and bound to you know build\nspec it into cloud code so that you you\nyou know and then it's going to be their\nworkflow. Um, and you're going to map\nyours towards it.\n>> Um, so everything I\n>> Exactly. So everything I'm doing right\nnow, I keep in mind that that's just\n>> the way I'm using cloud code right now\nbecause\n>> there's no like there's some something's\nmissing, right? [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to change.\nI mean, oh man, we're we're in for a\nfreaking ride here. That's for sure. I\nmean, like Yeah. I'm almost thinking we\ncould we could make a video every day\nabout what's going on almost.\n>> I don't really like the word toy. I\nprefer like terminal baby.\n>> Man, that's so fast.\n>> What's in progress and what has great\n>> how how is pearls implemented? Rust\n>> it's SQL light queries, right?\n>> So fast.\n>> Okay. Epic feature task. Epic feature\ntask. Cool.\n>> What does the P1 P2 What does that mean?\npriority. Um but he just did another\nupdate because um he added little status\nindicators. Um right now on the left\nside you see the tree and you see at the\ntop the little progress bar. It says I'm\n75% done with this epic. Um, if I filter\nit down and you see little like green\ncircles and little check marks next to\nto them and then if you go all the way\nto the right side, which is the type,\nyeah, there the metadata, there's\nchildren there and you can't really say\nwhich ones are closed and which ones are\nopened. Okay,\n>> so he just added that in uh this\nmorning. So now if you use PAL, you will\nsee every single one um if it's already\nclosed or not.\n>> Sweet. And but this progress bar is a\nbit aggressive, isn't it? This is for\nthe whole damn thing, right? Or does it\nget broken down depending what you're\nlooking at?\n>> Depending what you're looking at. So, if\nif you zoom in to just one phase, it's\ngoing to show the progress of that\nphase.\n>> Cool.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> It's a really good tool.\n>> What I kind of missed here when I went\nthrough them real quick, you would see\nthat every task has like the title, the\ndescription, the design, which tells you\nwhich files.\nIf you go a little bit back.\n>> Shoot.\n>> With this.\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. This one I I have to fix the\norder. Right now it's showing acceptance\ncriteria before design, but design\nshould be first. So you see the title\nthere's a little like what we're doing\nlike update the seat policy to grant the\nproduct engineer role. And then the\ndesign is you go to this migration file\nand then you add fourbin policy rules uh\nto the product engineer role. I just\nrealized changing the migration is\nprobably not the thing you want to do.\nYou should probably add a new migration.\nSo this was probably a wrong task. But\nsometimes I tell Opus like hey this is\nnowhere live. Don't need to worry about\nmigrations. Like just put all in one\nmigration because we don't have any live\nlife live data to migrate.\n>> So\n>> yeah like\n>> yeah I I couldn't help but but observe\nthat the the tasks are so actually very\ntight very tight. I like it.\n>> So finally\n>> and that's all opus opus created. So,\nOpus is creating all the tasks using\nbeats. Um and again like the concept of\nuser story it comes from specit right\nspecit creates the um creates like the\nuser stories and the functional\nrequirements and then when we go to the\nphase um sorry to the task generation it\nhas a template document and you know LLM\nare great at looking at example and\nfollowing the examples right so these\ntemplate documents like this task MD\nsays tells like any LLM really this is\nwhat I want you to do you know look at\nthe user stories break them down into\nphases when we generate task our task\nare focused like our first user story\nhere which is the MVP is to be able to\nrename a state so the first one uh no\nthe first one is the foundational phase\nand then we have user story one rename\nstate logic and under there are all the\ntasks and and and that's like P1 because\nthat's the MVP when we reach reach that\nwe can immediately like build the whole\nstack so we're building the API, the\nCLI, the SDK, I guess, everything.\n>> The the way that I've worked on software\nprojects, and I'm just sorry,\nslight tangent, is that I like to like\ndo something like Excaladraw, like draw\nthings out.\nAnd I'm just thinking aloud.\nYou know, for me looking at this, it\ndoes it does seem quite well structured,\nbut at the same time, I'm still very\ntempted to to whip out my uh you know,\npen and and paper, excal to draw things\nout a bit.\nI I don't know if that's a consideration\nwith um the visas. Anyway, side note,\n>> let's move on. Let me quickly go out of\nopen cloud last session.\n>> Oh, dash c continue.\n>> And it will show you all of the prompts\nthat I did to get the session going.\n>> Did you did you move your thing while\nrecording or did did Loom do this\nautomatically or something weird?\n>> No. No. Um I cut so my my face was over\nit and I dragged it and then when I was\nediting the video I cut the part where I\ndragged it.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So did you already put this in this?\nThis is ready running in an a as an\nagent when you do specker implement.\nOkay. So you got your terminal, you got\nyour clawed interactivity back, right?\n>> Yeah. This is a history of my prompts.\n>> Okay.\n>> So this was a a session that I just did.\nSo what I did was I opened cloud\ncontinue last session. I pressed the\ndouble escape to look at my prompt like\nhistory.\n>> Okay.\n>> There. And you see this one\n>> it literally one two three four five six\nprompts. Two of those were, you know,\nlike run the test this way and then\nupdate the memory to say like from now\non make sure you always run the test\nthis way, right? So really it was like\nthree prompts. One was showing the the\nthe actual user story which is ASC grit\nasse 3.4 and I also want beats currently\ndoes not show the comments when you do\nBD show. So I tell cloud specifically\nyou must do always show and comments so\nthat you see both because\n>> so what do you what are you using the\ncomments for just for updating and\n>> yeah so there was a problem with beats\nuh version 0.21 where BD update didn't\nwork. So after the task was created and\nI wanted to add in a note that didn't\nwork. So I I adopted this workflow of\nadding comments. So I also told Gemini\nand cloud whenever you're doing\nsomething um close the task with the\nreason why it's closed and add comments\num even when I'm doing a cross reference\ncheck like look at the the specification\nversus the plan versus the task that\nwere generated it cross spec clarify\nthen I say hey to all of these task make\nsure to add a comment to pay attention\nto use existing helpers don't rewrite\nhelpers because like I want haiku to\npick up the task know that there are\nexisting helpers and don't just build\nanother helpers. This is interesting. So\n>> I I'm more interested in the way that\nyou manage your agents because because\nlike say say you're working on your\nimplementation, you want to you want to\nspit out like three agents,\n>> don't you? And get them running in the\nbackground and then if you go control if\nyou go C, then the agents are killed or\nhow does this work?\n>> That so I tried it like three or four\ntimes and it hasn't worked well yet. So\nat this point I'm still the reason why\nyou want to run those agents in the\nbackground is that they they have their\nown little context and they can do all\nof the work and compile and verify and\nand fix.\n>> Yeah, I got that. But like how do you\nhow do you manage them like a process\ntask manager?\n>> I think cloud code not yet. Um\ndoing it\n>> a lot to do\n>> and cl code is at the forefront here. I\nmean, Codeex and Gemini haven't caught\nup in these regards, right?\n>> Well, I say that, but VS Code does have\num asynchronous uh agent support in a\nway.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm glad you you\nbasically are advertising your workflow\nhere. Oh god.\nYeah. So, Loom um they do this when you\nwhen you make a lot of videos and people\nwatch them at the end of the month. It\ngives you like, you know, gamification.\nIt tells you you have saved this many\nminutes across all of like all of the\npeople watching um minutes saved in\nmeetings and all that. So, Loom is a\nit's a pretty smart thing.\n>> Yeah, I guess um\nI mean there's a lot of like internal\nvideo sharing tools nowadays. And the\nthing that bugs me is that I usually\nlike to to record in quite high quality,\nyou know,\n>> full screen resolution. They always mess\nup. I mean, I'm I'm noticing that that\nthey cut corners there by pixelating the\nhell out of it.\n>> Um,\ncompressing the hell out of it rather.\n>> When you're going to replay this,\nnobody's going to hear what I say in the\nvideo because your voice is way louder\nthan than the video. So, you may need to\nlike, I don't know, play with the audio\nif you want people to hear or copy over\nthe audio track. I don't know. Um,\n>> from my point of view just now when I\nwas I was listening.\n>> True. We didn't I didn't record the\naudio. Oh [ __ ]\n>> Maybe on your machine it's recording my\nvoice louder together with your voice,\nbut on me watching it through Zoom, I\ndidn't hear myself very clearly. But uh\nyeah, I don't know. You can always work\non that\n>> when you when you do a share.\nI I should have made sure that I was\nrecording the uh Oh, yeah. Maybe could\nif you could. But how the hell am I I'm\ngoing to sync up the video. This\n>> I can download the MP4 and then you can\nsplit the audio from the video if you\nwant.\n>> Oh, no. This is This sounds hard. Okay.\nWell, I'll I'll try. Good luck.\n>> Let's see what what what was capt.\n>> So, can you talk about I thought it was\nquite exciting that you talked to the\nthe guy behind uh Zack behind Polas.\nCould you could you uh share what he\nsaid or was that a bit too uh\n>> No. Um basically\nbecause I'm I'm using it and I'm sharing\nthese really complicated di like\ndependency graphs right you see the tree\nis very complicated and he's asking me\nlike what what are you doing that\n[laughter] you have such a complicated\n>> task um you know diagram that's what\n>> um yeah so he was asking like is this\nlike across like multiple repositories\nis like a central database he just\nwanted to understand a little bit more\nhow I was using beats\nand we talked about a lot of things, but\nhe was very um you know bullish on beats\nbeing really one of the core ways that\nyou know agent memory will be you know\nhandled and context will be managed.\n>> I mean I don't know of anything better.\nI mean beads is next level. I saw just\nfunny on on LinkedIn the other day,\nBeans announced and I thought like they\nmade a typo, right? And they said it\nlike three times and Beans is the\nanother tool which is to give context to\nyour agent, but it's using like markdown\nas a as a as a storage mechanism. I was\nlike, what are they doing? They're\ncopying the name and they're not even\nusing it, dude.\nAnyway, no, but he's adding some really\ncool stuff and he's saying all of it is\na lot of it is opus and um he has a very\nlike good vision on the product. Like I\ndid some PRs where I tried to change\nthings and he was like um I don't really\nlike that. I think we can do it better\nif we do like this and like that. And\nthen he just went off and he did his\nthing and it's like yeah that's way\nbetter. That's like really nice.\n>> What do you mean like a product like\n>> Yeah. user experience like and the BQL.\nIf you like Jira, I think you're going\nto love Beats because it has this query\nlanguage and I didn't throw that in my\ndemo, but you can create\n>> I'm aware I I use the the Jira query\nlanguage with this weird plugin. Uh I'm\ntrying to remember the name of the\nplugin. So, what do you mean? So, you\nwere chatting with him and he came\nacross as a as a better product owner.\nSo, he was what refining the user\nstories or he had a different\n>> Yeah. I I did a couple of pull requests,\nright? And then he always asked the\nquestion like what is it that you're\ntrying to achieve like and are there\nother ways? And he's always thinking\nabout the most logical way. For example,\nI added a tree to the to the details\nview. But then we both kind of realized\nit made more sense if you're on the Kbar\nKBAN view like when you see the columns\nand you want you're on one of those\nissues, you want to press T and you get\nimmediately the full tree.\n>> You're talking about per you're not\ntalking about the grid, right?\n>> Yeah. No, no, purely about per pearls,\nhis product.\n>> Pearl. Sorry.\n>> We didn't talk about mine. We talked\nabout Per.\n>> Okay. So, you were So, he he had he had\na strong vision about how everything\nshould I mean I mean his is his baby. I\nmean, he's probably spent many hours uh\nthinking about it. Like any I I often\nfeel like the barrier to entry when you\nwhen you like introduce like a junior to\na project like the the junior is going\nto get like bombed out the water, right?\nBecause Yeah. didn't you think about\nthis? Like, no, I've only been thinking\n20 minutes about this product.\n[laughter]\n>> Uh, yeah. No, he has, of course, he\nknows also because he added this idea.\nOriginally, he had the columns and then\nhe has this query language which has\nlike a lexer and a parser. It's really\nnice and it translates to Yeah, it's\nlike a query lang language that\ntranslates down to SQL queries into the\nthe the issue database. If you go to um\n>> it's up there in under internal there's\na whole implementation.\n>> Okay. So he's using it for the for\ndifferent views and okay\n>> he has the idea of the expand down and\nexpand up and I saw it in his code when\nI added the tree view. Um I used the\nexpand to expand. Uh but I added\nsomething different and then he said the\nwhole idea behind expand was to create\nthose type of trees within the columns.\nUm, but it kind of evolved now. Like you\nhave the combine board. When you go into\ndetails, you see the the the tree on the\nside as you as you saw in what I just\nshowed you. But like\n>> since yesterday he had a topo sorting,\nhe added labeling like more indications.\n>> Well, I mean that kind of like\n>> if he's adding a ton of features, then I\nfeel like that means people are going to\nuse pearles in like a million different\nways. And I'm I'm all I I'm kind of\nthinking like a prescribed, you know,\nworkflow is somehow is what I'm looking\nfor. like I I don't want too much\nvariability, you know, because you can\n>> projects\n>> to to like give actually what you and I\ntalked about about how to package up\nyour skills, your plugins and your\ntools, everything as a bundle, which he\nalso said like I want to onboard the\nengineering team, 6,000 people at the\ncompany he's working at to to adopt LLM\nworkflows.\n>> So, what was his position in the\ncompany? Is he just like a lowly\nengineer or?\n>> No, [clears throat] he's like director\nlevel, I think. Uh,\n>> really?\n>> Yeah. But\n>> who does he work for? I mean, what is\nhis company?\n>> Click on his profile. Says Square, which\nis now Box. It's a Fortune 500. And And\n>> you mean Square the gaming company?\n>> No. Uh, no. It's a\nit's it's it's\n>> And this guy is French, I guess.\n>> No, he's from the US. He just likes\nFrench words.\nOkay. Um All right. So, he works for big\norganiz So, he's Yeah, I'm I'm actually\nfascinated by the human aspect to it\nbecause because Yeah, like how do we get\npeople adopting these workflows in in an\nengineering organization? he has the\nsame problem and there's I think quite a\nfew people\n>> a lot of people are looking at how to\nbuild out um\nadoption internally um matching internal\num quality standards right\nyeah\nI mean like there was a blog\nuh hold on let me stop my share because\nI'm probably going to share something\ncrazy\num\nLike I mean I think I can say this. I'm\ngoing to say it anyway. Like at my in my\nat my current client, we have so much\nproblems about just administering\nGitHub. Like people a lot of people\ndon't know who the who the hell is\nadministrating it. No one can seem to\ndecide whether copilot is an acceptable\nrisk. So some people are are using it.\nSome people are not allowed to use it. I\nI got this email 16 hours ago. It's from\nGitHub. I don't know if you can see it,\nbut basically it says like fine grain\ncontrol um delegate AI management. I'm\nthinking this is actually a fantastic\nthing for my current gig because because\nno one wants wants to have the\nresponsibility uh to to do this. So if\nthis can be employed, I'm thinking yay\n>> dedicated team.\nWell, I mean it's it's sad, but like I\nmean what I'm trying to say is that like\nwe're hardly even out the gates with my\nclient um never mind pearles, you know,\nit's it's really sad like like MC uh MCP\naccess is um disabled and I and I asked\nuh one of the guys why is MCP able um\ndisabled? He says oh because it can\nharvest your code and I was like m and\nMCP is for uh tool tool calls not for\nharvesting code. He says oh if you use\nthe GitHub MCP it will harvest your code\nand I'm like what\nthe the protocol is insecure. I don't I\nmean the protocol\n>> there's a lot of security blocks about\nthe ma massive gaps in in MCP servers.\nUm I I I can understand from a security\nperspective it has been a nightmare.\nEveryone just running Do you think do\nyou think the tool call will somehow ask\nask the AI to to basically upload the\ncode or something crazy? uh prompt\ninjection there can be you know these\ntools inject instructions into your\ncontext and it can tell the they they\nhave all\n>> so you're saying that with if if you if\nif um you're in a big company\n>> and\n>> yeah malicious MCPs or malicious\ncontributors to MCPs\n>> but isn't but isn't that like the case\nfor any dependency really but like like\nlike this person was worried about the\nGitHub MCP and like we're using GitHub\nhow can be worried about the GitHub MCP.\nIt's like integrated in VS Code. I was\nlike mind blown.\n>> Yeah, it's true.\n>> Yeah, I I don't know. It's\n[sighs]\n>> I guess it's just one of those risk\nmanagement things, but it's someone just\nneeds to do the work, I suppose. Um\nyeah, so I'm glad to see this update\nfrom from GitHub. That should make\nthings easier.\nAnd um yeah, I guess we're in for a wild\nride of trying to get people to adopt\neverything,\n>> trying to manage the adoption as well,\nright? Trying to make sure that um it's\nI think we talked about this as well in\nthe past. Um the worst thing a company\ncan do is completely blanket prohibit\n>> because people will just you know copy\npaste and it will be even worse. better\nis to put in place um access meth\nmethods that you know there's outdated\ncapabilities there's observability and\nmonitoring monitoring around it so\nthere's quite a lot of companies that\nlike offering this as a security\nsolution as being an AI router that you\nadopt and so you can see all your\n>> but I'm always like a bit knee-jerk\nreactionary to like process I feel like\nyou know we talked about how AI it's\nevolving so quickly\nAnd then a lot of people talk about oh\nwe need these processes in place to do\nthe things like yeah\nwe do need process we're discovering pro\nI mean we're discovering workflows but\nthese workflows cannot be uh static they\nhave to change very quickly day by day\nalmost and yeah\n>> security right\n>> I don't think any company is ready for\nthat um for you know like how many it\nit. Yeah. No company's ready for that\ncuz process is usually something\nenshrined in the company after some\ndebate and it's like a law and then it\ndoesn't change or you have to fight like\nhell to change it.\nYeah, I think I think this is a battle\nsecurity always has been fighting and\neven if you look at the recent events\nwith React,\nit's far from over. I didn't realize\nthat the second Cloudfare outage was\ncaused by this React CVE. Did you know\nthat? Or\n>> really? [laughter]\n>> Yeah. So, Tio did a I have to admit it\nnow. I must be a Tio subscriber because\nI bring him a puppy call now. [laughter]\n>> I don't know because I watch one of them\nnow. I see all of them. So whatever hate\nI give to Tio, I have to I have to\n>> Well, he's one of those I mean I think\nit's almost in the the YouTuber DNA to\nbe a little bit uh\ncontroversial and disliked, you know.\nYeah. So anyway, he he did a really nice\ncoverage of this uh React RC and the um\nindustry response to it. to how Versel\nand Cloudflare mitigated early against\nthis remote code execution because it's\na very severe bug and even even this\nmorning I saw there's another exploit\nagainst the the fix. So they released\n16.016\nand there's another exploit against\nthat.\n>> But this is nothing to do with AI is it?\nI mean\n>> uh it's no it's not\n>> software supply issue right?\n>> Yeah it's a software because we talked\nabout security and and and process\naround it. I I just thought it might be\nrelevant to bring up um that security\nalways had this battle not just with AI\nbut any type of um tools that we\nincorporate such as adopting NexJS uh\nand then using server components which\nis the React part that causes all of\nthese bugs all of these exploits lately\nand and so B apparently this was\nresponsibly disclosed by the researcher\nwho found the bug in the\nuh protocol and then Versel and\nCloudflare\nuh put firewall rules to detect the\npayload like the attacks so they could\nblock them. So for people that did not\nupdate their react or uh the moment that\nit goes public, right, they they publish\nthe fix immediately\n>> like intelligent firewall type thing,\n>> right? So\nproduct,\n>> right? So they they they put the the\nprotection in the firewall. So the\nsecond cloud flare outage was caused\nbecause they were rolling out they had\nto increase the buffer size of the um\nthe firewall software to be able to take\nin a bigger context.\n>> Yes. And then as they were rolling it\nout it noticed some some issues. So they\ndo um a gradual roll out across the\nregions of this like increase of buffer\nsize. But that that must be quite a\ncomplicated rule like they must detect\nsomehow.\n>> Yes. So the rule is really this react\nversion and\n>> Yes. And apparently the rule\n>> and it's all compile decompilation.\n>> No no de like the rule is bloody Lua.\n>> Yeah. L is nice and fast. It's uh\nprobably better than running shell on\nthe edge.\n>> Yeah. But it's not better than than a\ntyped uh like language where you you\ndiscover.\n>> Um, so basically what happened is that\nthe ex the rule when they tried to roll\nback. So the the bug the the problem the\noutage wasn't caused by the roll out the\noutage was caused by the roll back when\nthey they triggered the global config to\nroll back wherever it had been out\nrolled out and that component that does\nthe global roll out that\n>> why did they roll back? Sorry I didn't\nget that. So they were doing the roll\nout of the increased buffer size to\ncapture uh to improve the firewall rules\nand as they were rolling it out\ngradually they noticed some issues. So\nthey wanted to roll it back but when\nthey rolled it back they didn't do a\ngradual roll back. They just kicked off\nthis one service to do the roll back and\nthe rule engines had got into like an um\na state that shouldn't be possible. So\nthe execute rule was null was uh was was\nwas null but it was still loaded. So it\nwas like throwing errors. So that's kind\nof what he was saying um was the cause.\nSo I I thought it was funny that\neveryone's complaining about uh\nCloudflare two outages in in in like a\nmonth. How's it possible? And it's still\nso central to every like the internet is\nnot distributed. It's like too\ncentralized on a few big providers and\nand how can they have two outages? And\nit turns out that second outage was\ncaused by this React. Um,\n>> yeah, I'm always I'm always befuddled or\ninterested in how overthe-air updates\nwork uh because I rolled my own system\nyears ago and um using Git FS and uh it\nworks really well and then and then a\nlot of you know every company on this\nplanet now has to has to be able to ship\nupdates very effectively and roll back\nor roll forward what what have you. And\num\nmost often than not then these are where\nmistakes happen or bad implement you see\nbad implementation but anyway\num it's almost time for me to run off\nand take my kids to school.\n>> Mhm.\n>> Give me give me now. Okay. So I guess\nthis this chat we can call it\nabout spec kit ples workflow.\nWhat did we call the last one where we\ntalked about God knows what did we talk\nabout?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hey, thanks for listening to Vincent's\nand I conversation on AI and\ninfrastructure.\nDo please comment below on the YouTube\nchannel. Um any questions? Uh we'd love\nto incorporate your feedback into what\nwe do. And uh this podcast, if you're\nlistening without video, is available on\nSpotify. The website\nthebase.com/mpodcast.\nI think it's even available on Apple\nPodcasts. And you can perhaps leave a\nreview. Um I don't think I've ever had a\nreview on a podcast, so go crazy. I\ndon't care.\njust as long as I get some interaction\nfrom you would be awesome so that I can\nbe enthused to keep keep carrying on\nwith uh recording our conversations and\nand uh staying a breast of the latest AI\ninfrastructure stuff.\nI also wanted to mention that I will be\nin Fosdam this year in a month's time\nand I'll also go to an infrastructure\ncentric meet uh conference called config\nmanagement camp. I'll mention the the\nlink in the description. Um so yeah,\nhope to catch you up with the listeners\nand watchers\nthen and there and in the comment\nsection and wherever. Bye.",

H Beats, baby.\n[0:11] Could have fixed that one.\n[0:15] I did I did see the typo at some point,\n[0:17] but I forgot. Good point. Should update\n[0:19] that.\n[0:20] >> I share my workflow building a project\n[0:22] called the grid, which involves a\n[0:24] Terraform state back end. I discuss how\n[0:27] I've been using and modifying specket\n[0:29] for a more advanced cloud core cloud.\n[0:32] >> Yeah, I haven't updated. It's all\n[0:36] >> is this generated auto by AI?\n[0:38] >> Yeah, Loom. It's I'm paying for Loom.\n[0:40] And so Loom automatically does the\n[0:42] transcripts. It's a pretty easy editing\n[0:45] experience.\n[0:45] >> Oh, that's we need to do transcripts for\n[0:48] the podcast. That was my next little\n[0:50] epic.\n[0:51] >> Hey,\n[0:52] >> I wanted to share with you my AI\n[0:54] workflow. So, I'm currently building\n[0:56] something called the grid, which is a\n[0:58] >> I always find when people show their\n[1:00] toolbar,\n[1:02] it's a bit distracting.\n[1:04] >> Yeah. And there's too many like um icons\n[1:06] on there like bookmarks. I also noticed\n[1:08] it when I was rewatching.\n[1:09] >> Command B. I'm always conscious.\n[1:12] >> It's like it's like it's got to be a\n[1:14] name for it.\n[1:16] >> I know a terform state back end. It's\n[1:19] not very hip, but it's not a trivial um\n[1:22] project. So it requires a little bit\n[1:25] more advanced cloud code usage than just\n[1:28] traffic.\n[1:29] >> I can't I can't help but notice this\n[1:30] jur.\n[1:35] >> You can I never watch myself at at at\n[1:38] one. I always watch myself at 1.5 and\n[1:40] when I'm edit editing I watch myself at\n[1:42] two double speed.\n[1:45] >> I find it interesting that you call opus\n[1:47] a planning agent.\n[1:49] >> You will have a couple of\n[1:50] >> a lot of people do. Yeah. Then\n[1:52] >> so you you were saying that like when\n[1:54] Spectit updates you update, right? But\n[1:58] >> yeah, so I have a local copy of the\n[2:00] prompts and I go through their change\n[2:02] log and I pull in uh and try to merge my\n[2:05] changes together with theirs. For\n[2:07] example, one of them is originally\n[2:09] Speckit generated very nonsense branch\n[2:11] names, but then they modified the script\n[2:14] to um automatically like LLM create like\n[2:17] a nice branch name. Do you ever PR back\n[2:20] some of your suggestions back to them or\n[2:22] it's like you've personalized this or\n[2:24] something?\n[2:25] >> I am thinking about it. I'm not sure. I\n[2:28] I I really think it would be nice if I\n[2:30] could contribute it back and align mine\n[2:33] more with upstream. So, but I didn't\n[2:35] notice a lot of effort um lately on the\n[2:38] project. That's why I haven't um\n[2:41] contributed it back.\n[2:42] >> Oh, okay. Okay.\n[2:45] in my in my employer.\n[2:47] I'm I'm reluctant to to name it just\n[2:49] because I don't want to get myself in\n[2:50] hot water, but we have like quite a lot\n[2:52] of interesting material about how to to\n[2:55] launch. I think we call them inceptions.\n[2:57] I think uh it's it it's just how to to\n[3:01] to gather requirements, NFRs. There's\n[3:04] there's a lot\n[3:06] and and I can't help but think it must\n[3:08] it must match well to this sort of\n[3:10] stuff.\n[3:12] >> This is cool. This is cool. I'm just I'm\n[3:14] just thinking aloud that like uh in my\n[3:16] workplace we always have to do an ADR\n[3:20] for for things. What I don't like is\n[3:23] doing the ADR\n[3:25] before we implement it.\n[3:28] I don't know if you have any thoughts\n[3:30] about that, but I mean an arch\n[3:32] architecture decision record. Okay, this\n[3:34] this is a spec. You you're talking about\n[3:36] specs. an arch architecture decision\n[3:39] record isn't quite the same. But anyway,\n[3:42] it's just a thought at the moment. So I\n[3:43] just had maybe you can dive a bit on\n[3:45] that because I just had a call as well\n[3:47] uh with someone who's building more like\n[3:49] a multi- aent system to like when cloud\n[3:53] has completed some work kick off a\n[3:55] review agent or one or more review\n[3:58] agents to get feedback and I was like\n[4:00] why do you do the review and and\n[4:03] [clears throat] then this examples he\n[4:04] gave me was like\n[4:06] >> the review agent needs to validate that\n[4:08] the implementation matches the user like\n[4:10] uh story or the business value and I'm\n[4:12] like actually speckit inverses that and\n[4:15] I feel like is it is speckit more\n[4:18] waterfall like than agile because you're\n[4:21] making a lot of decisions up front\n[4:23] you're doing like a a resource\n[4:26] >> research but I also think and I think\n[4:28] this so yes speckit is doing anversion\n[4:31] of like making sure that the\n[4:33] specifications are defined first um but\n[4:35] what speckit also does is\n[4:39] it's like 70% planning 30% and um agents\n[4:43] writing code. So you do the check-in of\n[4:45] the of the specifications, the user data\n[4:47] and all that and the tech research and\n[4:49] then I imagine you go off on another\n[4:51] branch, you let the agents write all the\n[4:53] code and then if you encounter any\n[4:56] issues with that design, you just throw\n[4:58] away because it's so easy uh and so\n[5:00] cheap to generate code and you go back\n[5:02] to the research and you're like, \"Hey,\n[5:04] we tried this. We we got stuck there.\n[5:06] There's some problems with this design\n[5:08] because course adjusting midway is not\n[5:10] that easy.\" like in if I'm in the middle\n[5:12] and I have like generated 20 tasks and\n[5:14] they assume that I've gone down this\n[5:16] path where this file exists over there\n[5:18] and that turns out to be a wrong path,\n[5:20] you must be able to backtrack. So I\n[5:22] think that's something I'm not doing\n[5:23] right now because I'm trying to course\n[5:25] adjust. I think specit is kind of agile\n[5:28] in that way.\n[5:29] >> I I don't I didn't quite get that. So\n[5:31] when you course adjust are you saying\n[5:34] that your initial spec doesn't keep up\n[5:38] the specs don't keep up with that course\n[5:40] adjustment or\n[5:42] >> yeah if the whole you know idea here\n[5:45] that I'm I'm I'm highlighting why I like\n[5:48] speckit is that it goes through all of\n[5:50] the code and it highlights clearly like\n[5:52] okay we're going to introduce this\n[5:53] feature and it's going to touch these\n[5:55] five components in this component we\n[5:57] have to change this in that component we\n[5:58] have to change that and there's a\n[6:00] contract between them, right? So, you\n[6:02] get very small tasks and you send them\n[6:04] off into agents to to to complete those\n[6:06] tasks. When everything comes back, you\n[6:08] should, you know, and you're building a\n[6:10] bridge, you have to meet in the middle,\n[6:11] right? Not not like and\n[6:13] >> so so if in the middle one guy was\n[6:16] successfully building against the\n[6:17] contract, but the other guy had like a\n[6:19] massive issue, maybe you need to be able\n[6:21] to step back and course adjust where the\n[6:23] rest of the plan is like laid out\n[6:25] according to that path. So, that's kind\n[6:27] of like\n[6:28] >> the hard bit about it. But I think\n[6:31] >> I think you have the same if you do an\n[6:32] ADR right you you will have gone through\n[6:34] several parts identifies the issues and\n[6:37] backtracked right\n[6:38] >> yeah like the whole point of an ADR is\n[6:41] to to be honest ADR's arch architecture\n[6:44] decision records are are different for\n[6:46] every company but the expectation in my\n[6:48] current gig is that they that you have\n[6:51] like three choices you you have your\n[6:53] three vendors or whatever your three\n[6:56] things and you and you basically\n[7:00] show that you that you done some due\n[7:02] diligence in comparing the three\n[7:04] options.\n[7:05] So, it's not quite it's not the same as\n[7:07] a spec, but I I can imagine all feeds\n[7:10] into each other because\n[7:13] yeah, it's anyway, it's that's but\n[7:16] another point [snorts] of feedback that\n[7:18] I got u when I explained the specket um\n[7:21] workflow to the guy who's building the\n[7:23] to Zach who's building the beats uh UI.\n[7:27] He he also highlighted to me that in\n[7:30] agile you will have a retrospective and\n[7:34] speckit doesn't have that retrospective\n[7:36] the way he understands it right now like\n[7:37] where you go back and adjust the the\n[7:40] prompt templates to like make sure that\n[7:42] you don't go do make those same mistakes\n[7:44] >> and and then furthermore like specit is\n[7:47] for driving AI like I feel like we\n[7:49] almost need a speck it for driving\n[7:51] humans because like all these workflows\n[7:55] all these things it's complicated\n[7:57] Well, is it? Yeah, it is. It is. We're\n[7:59] all learning here.\n[8:00] >> We're all learning how to drive the AI\n[8:02] and like it's it's quite it's not easy\n[8:05] um to keep everyone on board cuz it's\n[8:09] moving quite quickly too, you know, like\n[8:12] like I mean some of my stakeholders are\n[8:14] like non-technical like if if I go\n[8:17] rampant with the AI, I mean they're not\n[8:19] going to keep up basically.\n[8:22] [snorts]\n[8:22] >> Yeah. Y more areas. So one one thing\n[8:25] that's come up on my radar a lot is this\n[8:28] is this term uh pro progressive\n[8:30] disclosure when you write these markdown\n[8:32] files\n[8:34] would you say they progressively\n[8:36] disclosing the the task or how or does\n[8:40] it even feature in here? I I guess the\n[8:43] AI is expected to read the whole damn\n[8:45] thing and the end of Right.\n[8:47] So I think that's where um beats comes\n[8:50] in very nicely which I'm going to\n[8:51] mention next when I show this 1,300 line\n[8:54] file which um it's beats allows the AI\n[8:58] to stay focused on just um a small\n[9:00] portion of the of the markdown. I don't\n[9:02] think markdown is the best way to\n[9:05] progressively\n[9:06] um disclose like the details. I think\n[9:10] with Beats you actually get like the\n[9:12] high overview and you can drill down\n[9:13] into one issue and then get exactly that\n[9:15] like design acceptance criteria\n[9:17] >> in in the anthropic documentation. I\n[9:19] think the I mean they don't say this but\n[9:22] my interpretation is that like with the\n[9:24] skill markdown you you structure your\n[9:27] mark you you structure your markdown to\n[9:28] have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 with the\n[9:31] realization that the thing might not get\n[9:33] to 10 you know but anyway\n[9:35] >> tasks. So you label them. Interesting.\n[9:40] So you must have a reason for labeling\n[9:42] them prereec edge status\n[9:45] validation inference web app.\n[9:49] >> So the the problem was when I was\n[9:52] playing with beats I realized that there\n[9:54] wasn't really a good way to query the\n[9:55] list unless you use labels. like you can\n[9:58] see the next set of ready tasks but if\n[10:00] you have like multiple feature branches\n[10:03] then there will be a complete mixture of\n[10:05] different tasks in that database because\n[10:07] they are shared right it's on the root\n[10:08] of the repo so if you have like multiple\n[10:10] branches but you're merging things in um\n[10:14] there is actually the beats database is\n[10:16] shared this is very different between\n[10:17] specit which the task file is for one\n[10:20] feature but beats is like a central\n[10:22] database and and I realized you couldn't\n[10:25] really query that database case unless\n[10:28] you use labels. So labels were the only\n[10:30] way to like slice and dice the the the\n[10:33] issues.\n[10:34] >> Yeah,\n[10:35] >> fair enough. I guess I'm always thinking\n[10:39] hierarchically for some reason, you\n[10:41] know, like I'm thinking epic feature du\n[10:43] du du.\n[10:44] >> I will show you the the the graph in a\n[10:48] >> Yeah.\n[10:48] >> Oh, I thought you were going to mention\n[10:50] BD ready, but maybe you're going to do\n[10:51] that. I mean, spec implement is BD\n[10:54] ready, right?\n[10:57] Yeah. Um, kind of it's it's you have to\n[11:01] augment implement with with the next\n[11:05] steps to do. I'm I'm actually not using\n[11:07] BD ready. I'm usually telling it like\n[11:09] we're going to work on user story one.\n[11:11] We're going to work on user story 2. And\n[11:13] usually I want the ready to be filtered\n[11:15] down to user story one or user story 2.\n[11:18] So um they just added that with\n[11:20] capability. Before you could not um\n[11:23] filter ready by label, but now you can\n[11:25] and and I updated my prompt as well like\n[11:28] use the BD ready but with these label\n[11:30] filters.\n[11:31] >> It's interesting that you use user\n[11:32] stories for some reason.\n[11:36] I mean every every every\n[11:40] card, every task for me has a user\n[11:43] story. But I'm guessing you're using\n[11:45] user story as a more of a high level um\n[11:50] a high level feature that you want to\n[11:52] implement. Okay.\n[11:53] >> Yeah. So basically when you run like\n[11:55] specify it's going to generate user\n[11:57] stories and then it's going to create\n[11:59] functional requirements and when I do\n[12:03] after I do the research it's going to\n[12:04] generate the tasks and every task must\n[12:07] be backed by a functional requirement or\n[12:09] a user story. Right? So every task. So\n[12:12] we I I get like epic. Then I have user\n[12:15] story which is feature because um beats\n[12:18] only has like epic feature and task and\n[12:20] I map them from specify um feature to\n[12:23] epic and user story to feature and task\n[12:27] to task. So\n[12:28] >> So your task doesn't have a user story.\n[12:30] It just has like some like\n[12:33] >> it's a child of a user story and has the\n[12:35] labels of the functional requirements.\n[12:38] >> Interesting.\n[12:39] >> Yeah. So you will see that I think when\n[12:41] when we look at the UI like\n[12:42] >> okay\n[12:43] >> cuz that's the next step\n[12:45] >> on the topic of context window I'm I'm\n[12:47] loving how beads allows me to manage the\n[12:49] context window loving it\n[12:53] but in the future the context is is\n[12:56] bound to grow right and I'm just\n[12:58] thinking to myself like I'm I'm doing\n[13:00] all this effort to to to manage the\n[13:04] context more effectively\n[13:07] if you know tomorrow they they launch\n[13:10] uh Claude Son 6.0 and it has like\n[13:14] practically unlimited context.\n[13:17] Am I like have I just wasted my time is\n[13:19] is the thought that was running through\n[13:21] my mind.\n[13:23] >> My thought is more more that like\n[13:26] anthropic is bound to build beats into\n[13:29] cloud code and bound to you know build\n[13:32] spec it into cloud code so that you you\n[13:36] you know and then it's going to be their\n[13:37] workflow. Um, and you're going to map\n[13:40] yours towards it.\n[13:42] >> Um, so everything I\n[13:44] >> Exactly. So everything I'm doing right\n[13:46] now, I keep in mind that that's just\n[13:49] >> the way I'm using cloud code right now\n[13:51] because\n[13:52] >> there's no like there's some something's\n[13:55] missing, right? [snorts]\n[13:57] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to change.\n[13:58] I mean, oh man, we're we're in for a\n[14:00] freaking ride here. That's for sure. I\n[14:02] mean, like Yeah. I'm almost thinking we\n[14:04] could we could make a video every day\n[14:06] about what's going on almost.\n[14:08] >> I don't really like the word toy. I\n[14:10] prefer like terminal baby.\n[14:13] >> Man, that's so fast.\n[14:14] >> What's in progress and what has great\n[14:17] >> how how is pearls implemented? Rust\n[14:21] >> it's SQL light queries, right?\n[14:23] >> So fast.\n[14:25] >> Okay. Epic feature task. Epic feature\n[14:27] task. Cool.\n[14:29] >> What does the P1 P2 What does that mean?\n[14:32] priority. Um but he just did another\n[14:35] update because um he added little status\n[14:39] indicators. Um right now on the left\n[14:43] side you see the tree and you see at the\n[14:44] top the little progress bar. It says I'm\n[14:46] 75% done with this epic. Um, if I filter\n[14:50] it down and you see little like green\n[14:53] circles and little check marks next to\n[14:56] to them and then if you go all the way\n[14:58] to the right side, which is the type,\n[15:01] yeah, there the metadata, there's\n[15:03] children there and you can't really say\n[15:05] which ones are closed and which ones are\n[15:06] opened. Okay,\n[15:07] >> so he just added that in uh this\n[15:09] morning. So now if you use PAL, you will\n[15:11] see every single one um if it's already\n[15:14] closed or not.\n[15:15] >> Sweet. And but this progress bar is a\n[15:18] bit aggressive, isn't it? This is for\n[15:19] the whole damn thing, right? Or does it\n[15:21] get broken down depending what you're\n[15:23] looking at?\n[15:25] >> Depending what you're looking at. So, if\n[15:26] if you zoom in to just one phase, it's\n[15:28] going to show the progress of that\n[15:29] phase.\n[15:30] >> Cool.\n[15:32] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[15:33] >> It's a really good tool.\n[15:34] >> What I kind of missed here when I went\n[15:38] through them real quick, you would see\n[15:40] that every task has like the title, the\n[15:43] description, the design, which tells you\n[15:46] which files.\n[15:48] If you go a little bit back.\n[15:50] >> Shoot.\n[15:51] >> With this.\n[15:52] >> Yeah.\n[15:54] Yeah.\n[15:55] >> Yeah. This one I I have to fix the\n[15:57] order. Right now it's showing acceptance\n[15:58] criteria before design, but design\n[16:00] should be first. So you see the title\n[16:02] there's a little like what we're doing\n[16:04] like update the seat policy to grant the\n[16:06] product engineer role. And then the\n[16:08] design is you go to this migration file\n[16:11] and then you add fourbin policy rules uh\n[16:14] to the product engineer role. I just\n[16:16] realized changing the migration is\n[16:18] probably not the thing you want to do.\n[16:19] You should probably add a new migration.\n[16:21] So this was probably a wrong task. But\n[16:23] sometimes I tell Opus like hey this is\n[16:25] nowhere live. Don't need to worry about\n[16:27] migrations. Like just put all in one\n[16:28] migration because we don't have any live\n[16:30] life live data to migrate.\n[16:32] >> So\n[16:32] >> yeah like\n[16:33] >> yeah I I couldn't help but but observe\n[16:36] that the the tasks are so actually very\n[16:39] tight very tight. I like it.\n[16:41] >> So finally\n[16:42] >> and that's all opus opus created. So,\n[16:44] Opus is creating all the tasks using\n[16:46] beats. Um and again like the concept of\n[16:50] user story it comes from specit right\n[16:52] specit creates the um creates like the\n[16:57] user stories and the functional\n[16:58] requirements and then when we go to the\n[17:00] phase um sorry to the task generation it\n[17:04] has a template document and you know LLM\n[17:05] are great at looking at example and\n[17:07] following the examples right so these\n[17:09] template documents like this task MD\n[17:12] says tells like any LLM really this is\n[17:15] what I want you to do you know look at\n[17:17] the user stories break them down into\n[17:19] phases when we generate task our task\n[17:22] are focused like our first user story\n[17:23] here which is the MVP is to be able to\n[17:26] rename a state so the first one uh no\n[17:29] the first one is the foundational phase\n[17:31] and then we have user story one rename\n[17:32] state logic and under there are all the\n[17:34] tasks and and and that's like P1 because\n[17:37] that's the MVP when we reach reach that\n[17:40] we can immediately like build the whole\n[17:42] stack so we're building the API, the\n[17:44] CLI, the SDK, I guess, everything.\n[17:46] >> The the way that I've worked on software\n[17:49] projects, and I'm just sorry,\n[17:52] slight tangent, is that I like to like\n[17:57] do something like Excaladraw, like draw\n[17:59] things out.\n[18:01] And I'm just thinking aloud.\n[18:05] You know, for me looking at this, it\n[18:07] does it does seem quite well structured,\n[18:09] but at the same time, I'm still very\n[18:11] tempted to to whip out my uh you know,\n[18:14] pen and and paper, excal to draw things\n[18:17] out a bit.\n[18:19] I I don't know if that's a consideration\n[18:22] with um the visas. Anyway, side note,\n[18:26] >> let's move on. Let me quickly go out of\n[18:29] open cloud last session.\n[18:32] >> Oh, dash c continue.\n[18:33] >> And it will show you all of the prompts\n[18:35] that I did to get the session going.\n[18:36] >> Did you did you move your thing while\n[18:39] recording or did did Loom do this\n[18:41] automatically or something weird?\n[18:43] >> No. No. Um I cut so my my face was over\n[18:46] it and I dragged it and then when I was\n[18:49] editing the video I cut the part where I\n[18:51] dragged it.\n[18:52] >> Yeah.\n[18:53] >> So did you already put this in this?\n[18:55] This is ready running in an a as an\n[18:57] agent when you do specker implement.\n[18:59] Okay. So you got your terminal, you got\n[19:01] your clawed interactivity back, right?\n[19:05] >> Yeah. This is a history of my prompts.\n[19:07] >> Okay.\n[19:08] >> So this was a a session that I just did.\n[19:10] So what I did was I opened cloud\n[19:12] continue last session. I pressed the\n[19:15] double escape to look at my prompt like\n[19:17] history.\n[19:18] >> Okay.\n[19:18] >> There. And you see this one\n[19:20] >> it literally one two three four five six\n[19:23] prompts. Two of those were, you know,\n[19:27] like run the test this way and then\n[19:29] update the memory to say like from now\n[19:31] on make sure you always run the test\n[19:32] this way, right? So really it was like\n[19:35] three prompts. One was showing the the\n[19:38] the actual user story which is ASC grit\n[19:41] asse 3.4 and I also want beats currently\n[19:45] does not show the comments when you do\n[19:47] BD show. So I tell cloud specifically\n[19:50] you must do always show and comments so\n[19:54] that you see both because\n[19:55] >> so what do you what are you using the\n[19:56] comments for just for updating and\n[19:58] >> yeah so there was a problem with beats\n[20:01] uh version 0.21 where BD update didn't\n[20:05] work. So after the task was created and\n[20:07] I wanted to add in a note that didn't\n[20:10] work. So I I adopted this workflow of\n[20:12] adding comments. So I also told Gemini\n[20:15] and cloud whenever you're doing\n[20:17] something um close the task with the\n[20:20] reason why it's closed and add comments\n[20:23] um even when I'm doing a cross reference\n[20:25] check like look at the the specification\n[20:28] versus the plan versus the task that\n[20:30] were generated it cross spec clarify\n[20:33] then I say hey to all of these task make\n[20:35] sure to add a comment to pay attention\n[20:37] to use existing helpers don't rewrite\n[20:40] helpers because like I want haiku to\n[20:42] pick up the task know that there are\n[20:44] existing helpers and don't just build\n[20:45] another helpers. This is interesting. So\n[20:47] >> I I'm more interested in the way that\n[20:49] you manage your agents because because\n[20:52] like say say you're working on your\n[20:55] implementation, you want to you want to\n[20:57] spit out like three agents,\n[21:00] >> don't you? And get them running in the\n[21:02] background and then if you go control if\n[21:04] you go C, then the agents are killed or\n[21:07] how does this work?\n[21:08] >> That so I tried it like three or four\n[21:10] times and it hasn't worked well yet. So\n[21:13] at this point I'm still the reason why\n[21:16] you want to run those agents in the\n[21:17] background is that they they have their\n[21:19] own little context and they can do all\n[21:20] of the work and compile and verify and\n[21:23] and fix.\n[21:24] >> Yeah, I got that. But like how do you\n[21:25] how do you manage them like a process\n[21:28] task manager?\n[21:29] >> I think cloud code not yet. Um\n[21:33] doing it\n[21:34] >> a lot to do\n[21:35] >> and cl code is at the forefront here. I\n[21:38] mean, Codeex and Gemini haven't caught\n[21:39] up in these regards, right?\n[21:41] >> Well, I say that, but VS Code does have\n[21:44] um asynchronous uh agent support in a\n[21:46] way.\n[21:48] >> Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm glad you you\n[21:50] basically are advertising your workflow\n[21:53] here. Oh god.\n[21:55] Yeah. So, Loom um they do this when you\n[21:57] when you make a lot of videos and people\n[21:59] watch them at the end of the month. It\n[22:01] gives you like, you know, gamification.\n[22:03] It tells you you have saved this many\n[22:05] minutes across all of like all of the\n[22:07] people watching um minutes saved in\n[22:10] meetings and all that. So, Loom is a\n[22:12] it's a pretty smart thing.\n[22:15] >> Yeah, I guess um\n[22:18] I mean there's a lot of like internal\n[22:20] video sharing tools nowadays. And the\n[22:21] thing that bugs me is that I usually\n[22:23] like to to record in quite high quality,\n[22:26] you know,\n[22:27] >> full screen resolution. They always mess\n[22:29] up. I mean, I'm I'm noticing that that\n[22:32] they cut corners there by pixelating the\n[22:34] hell out of it.\n[22:36] >> Um,\n[22:38] compressing the hell out of it rather.\n[22:40] >> When you're going to replay this,\n[22:42] nobody's going to hear what I say in the\n[22:43] video because your voice is way louder\n[22:45] than than the video. So, you may need to\n[22:47] like, I don't know, play with the audio\n[22:49] if you want people to hear or copy over\n[22:52] the audio track. I don't know. Um,\n[22:57] >> from my point of view just now when I\n[22:59] was I was listening.\n[23:00] >> True. We didn't I didn't record the\n[23:02] audio. Oh [ __ ]\n[23:04] >> Maybe on your machine it's recording my\n[23:07] voice louder together with your voice,\n[23:09] but on me watching it through Zoom, I\n[23:12] didn't hear myself very clearly. But uh\n[23:14] yeah, I don't know. You can always work\n[23:16] on that\n[23:16] >> when you when you do a share.\n[23:20] I I should have made sure that I was\n[23:22] recording the uh Oh, yeah. Maybe could\n[23:26] if you could. But how the hell am I I'm\n[23:28] going to sync up the video. This\n[23:30] >> I can download the MP4 and then you can\n[23:32] split the audio from the video if you\n[23:34] want.\n[23:35] >> Oh, no. This is This sounds hard. Okay.\n[23:38] Well, I'll I'll try. Good luck.\n[23:39] >> Let's see what what what was capt.\n[23:41] >> So, can you talk about I thought it was\n[23:44] quite exciting that you talked to the\n[23:46] the guy behind uh Zack behind Polas.\n[23:49] Could you could you uh share what he\n[23:52] said or was that a bit too uh\n[23:54] >> No. Um basically\n[23:57] because I'm I'm using it and I'm sharing\n[24:00] these really complicated di like\n[24:02] dependency graphs right you see the tree\n[24:04] is very complicated and he's asking me\n[24:06] like what what are you doing that\n[24:08] [laughter] you have such a complicated\n[24:10] >> task um you know diagram that's what\n[24:13] >> um yeah so he was asking like is this\n[24:16] like across like multiple repositories\n[24:19] is like a central database he just\n[24:22] wanted to understand a little bit more\n[24:23] how I was using beats\n[24:25] and we talked about a lot of things, but\n[24:28] he was very um you know bullish on beats\n[24:33] being really one of the core ways that\n[24:37] you know agent memory will be you know\n[24:40] handled and context will be managed.\n[24:42] >> I mean I don't know of anything better.\n[24:43] I mean beads is next level. I saw just\n[24:46] funny on on LinkedIn the other day,\n[24:48] Beans announced and I thought like they\n[24:50] made a typo, right? And they said it\n[24:51] like three times and Beans is the\n[24:54] another tool which is to give context to\n[24:56] your agent, but it's using like markdown\n[24:59] as a as a as a storage mechanism. I was\n[25:02] like, what are they doing? They're\n[25:03] copying the name and they're not even\n[25:06] using it, dude.\n[25:08] Anyway, no, but he's adding some really\n[25:10] cool stuff and he's saying all of it is\n[25:13] a lot of it is opus and um he has a very\n[25:17] like good vision on the product. Like I\n[25:20] did some PRs where I tried to change\n[25:21] things and he was like um I don't really\n[25:24] like that. I think we can do it better\n[25:25] if we do like this and like that. And\n[25:27] then he just went off and he did his\n[25:29] thing and it's like yeah that's way\n[25:30] better. That's like really nice.\n[25:32] >> What do you mean like a product like\n[25:36] >> Yeah. user experience like and the BQL.\n[25:39] If you like Jira, I think you're going\n[25:41] to love Beats because it has this query\n[25:43] language and I didn't throw that in my\n[25:44] demo, but you can create\n[25:46] >> I'm aware I I use the the Jira query\n[25:48] language with this weird plugin. Uh I'm\n[25:51] trying to remember the name of the\n[25:53] plugin. So, what do you mean? So, you\n[25:56] were chatting with him and he came\n[25:58] across as a as a better product owner.\n[26:00] So, he was what refining the user\n[26:03] stories or he had a different\n[26:05] >> Yeah. I I did a couple of pull requests,\n[26:07] right? And then he always asked the\n[26:08] question like what is it that you're\n[26:10] trying to achieve like and are there\n[26:12] other ways? And he's always thinking\n[26:13] about the most logical way. For example,\n[26:15] I added a tree to the to the details\n[26:18] view. But then we both kind of realized\n[26:21] it made more sense if you're on the Kbar\n[26:23] KBAN view like when you see the columns\n[26:25] and you want you're on one of those\n[26:26] issues, you want to press T and you get\n[26:28] immediately the full tree.\n[26:29] >> You're talking about per you're not\n[26:31] talking about the grid, right?\n[26:33] >> Yeah. No, no, purely about per pearls,\n[26:35] his product.\n[26:36] >> Pearl. Sorry.\n[26:36] >> We didn't talk about mine. We talked\n[26:38] about Per.\n[26:39] >> Okay. So, you were So, he he had he had\n[26:42] a strong vision about how everything\n[26:44] should I mean I mean his is his baby. I\n[26:47] mean, he's probably spent many hours uh\n[26:50] thinking about it. Like any I I often\n[26:54] feel like the barrier to entry when you\n[26:55] when you like introduce like a junior to\n[26:57] a project like the the junior is going\n[27:00] to get like bombed out the water, right?\n[27:01] Because Yeah. didn't you think about\n[27:03] this? Like, no, I've only been thinking\n[27:04] 20 minutes about this product.\n[27:07] [laughter]\n[27:07] >> Uh, yeah. No, he has, of course, he\n[27:10] knows also because he added this idea.\n[27:13] Originally, he had the columns and then\n[27:14] he has this query language which has\n[27:16] like a lexer and a parser. It's really\n[27:18] nice and it translates to Yeah, it's\n[27:21] like a query lang language that\n[27:22] translates down to SQL queries into the\n[27:25] the the issue database. If you go to um\n[27:28] >> it's up there in under internal there's\n[27:31] a whole implementation.\n[27:32] >> Okay. So he's using it for the for\n[27:34] different views and okay\n[27:35] >> he has the idea of the expand down and\n[27:38] expand up and I saw it in his code when\n[27:41] I added the tree view. Um I used the\n[27:44] expand to expand. Uh but I added\n[27:47] something different and then he said the\n[27:50] whole idea behind expand was to create\n[27:52] those type of trees within the columns.\n[27:55] Um, but it kind of evolved now. Like you\n[27:58] have the combine board. When you go into\n[27:59] details, you see the the the tree on the\n[28:01] side as you as you saw in what I just\n[28:03] showed you. But like\n[28:05] >> since yesterday he had a topo sorting,\n[28:08] he added labeling like more indications.\n[28:10] >> Well, I mean that kind of like\n[28:12] >> if he's adding a ton of features, then I\n[28:15] feel like that means people are going to\n[28:17] use pearles in like a million different\n[28:19] ways. And I'm I'm all I I'm kind of\n[28:23] thinking like a prescribed, you know,\n[28:26] workflow is somehow is what I'm looking\n[28:30] for. like I I don't want too much\n[28:32] variability, you know, because you can\n[28:35] >> projects\n[28:36] >> to to like give actually what you and I\n[28:39] talked about about how to package up\n[28:42] your skills, your plugins and your\n[28:43] tools, everything as a bundle, which he\n[28:46] also said like I want to onboard the\n[28:49] engineering team, 6,000 people at the\n[28:51] company he's working at to to adopt LLM\n[28:54] workflows.\n[28:55] >> So, what was his position in the\n[28:56] company? Is he just like a lowly\n[28:58] engineer or?\n[28:59] >> No, [clears throat] he's like director\n[29:00] level, I think. Uh,\n[29:02] >> really?\n[29:04] >> Yeah. But\n[29:06] >> who does he work for? I mean, what is\n[29:08] his company?\n[29:09] >> Click on his profile. Says Square, which\n[29:12] is now Box. It's a Fortune 500. And And\n[29:16] >> you mean Square the gaming company?\n[29:19] >> No. Uh, no. It's a\n[29:22] it's it's it's\n[29:26] >> And this guy is French, I guess.\n[29:28] >> No, he's from the US. He just likes\n[29:30] French words.\n[29:35] Okay. Um All right. So, he works for big\n[29:37] organiz So, he's Yeah, I'm I'm actually\n[29:41] fascinated by the human aspect to it\n[29:43] because because Yeah, like how do we get\n[29:45] people adopting these workflows in in an\n[29:47] engineering organization? he has the\n[29:49] same problem and there's I think quite a\n[29:51] few people\n[29:52] >> a lot of people are looking at how to\n[29:54] build out um\n[29:57] adoption internally um matching internal\n[30:01] um quality standards right\n[30:05] yeah\n[30:07] I mean like there was a blog\n[30:10] uh hold on let me stop my share because\n[30:13] I'm probably going to share something\n[30:14] crazy\n[30:16] um\n[30:18] Like I mean I think I can say this. I'm\n[30:20] going to say it anyway. Like at my in my\n[30:22] at my current client, we have so much\n[30:25] problems about just administering\n[30:27] GitHub. Like people a lot of people\n[30:29] don't know who the who the hell is\n[30:31] administrating it. No one can seem to\n[30:34] decide whether copilot is an acceptable\n[30:37] risk. So some people are are using it.\n[30:40] Some people are not allowed to use it. I\n[30:43] I got this email 16 hours ago. It's from\n[30:46] GitHub. I don't know if you can see it,\n[30:47] but basically it says like fine grain\n[30:50] control um delegate AI management. I'm\n[30:54] thinking this is actually a fantastic\n[30:56] thing for my current gig because because\n[31:00] no one wants wants to have the\n[31:02] responsibility uh to to do this. So if\n[31:06] this can be employed, I'm thinking yay\n[31:09] >> dedicated team.\n[31:12] Well, I mean it's it's sad, but like I\n[31:16] mean what I'm trying to say is that like\n[31:20] we're hardly even out the gates with my\n[31:22] client um never mind pearles, you know,\n[31:26] it's it's really sad like like MC uh MCP\n[31:29] access is um disabled and I and I asked\n[31:33] uh one of the guys why is MCP able um\n[31:37] disabled? He says oh because it can\n[31:39] harvest your code and I was like m and\n[31:42] MCP is for uh tool tool calls not for\n[31:45] harvesting code. He says oh if you use\n[31:47] the GitHub MCP it will harvest your code\n[31:50] and I'm like what\n[31:54] the the protocol is insecure. I don't I\n[31:57] mean the protocol\n[31:58] >> there's a lot of security blocks about\n[32:00] the ma massive gaps in in MCP servers.\n[32:05] Um I I I can understand from a security\n[32:08] perspective it has been a nightmare.\n[32:10] Everyone just running Do you think do\n[32:12] you think the tool call will somehow ask\n[32:15] ask the AI to to basically upload the\n[32:18] code or something crazy? uh prompt\n[32:21] injection there can be you know these\n[32:24] tools inject instructions into your\n[32:26] context and it can tell the they they\n[32:30] have all\n[32:31] >> so you're saying that with if if you if\n[32:33] if um you're in a big company\n[32:36] >> and\n[32:36] >> yeah malicious MCPs or malicious\n[32:38] contributors to MCPs\n[32:40] >> but isn't but isn't that like the case\n[32:42] for any dependency really but like like\n[32:45] like this person was worried about the\n[32:47] GitHub MCP and like we're using GitHub\n[32:50] how can be worried about the GitHub MCP.\n[32:52] It's like integrated in VS Code. I was\n[32:55] like mind blown.\n[32:57] >> Yeah, it's true.\n[33:00] >> Yeah, I I don't know. It's\n[33:04] [sighs]\n[33:05] >> I guess it's just one of those risk\n[33:06] management things, but it's someone just\n[33:09] needs to do the work, I suppose. Um\n[33:13] yeah, so I'm glad to see this update\n[33:17] from from GitHub. That should make\n[33:18] things easier.\n[33:20] And um yeah, I guess we're in for a wild\n[33:22] ride of trying to get people to adopt\n[33:24] everything,\n[33:27] >> trying to manage the adoption as well,\n[33:28] right? Trying to make sure that um it's\n[33:32] I think we talked about this as well in\n[33:34] the past. Um the worst thing a company\n[33:37] can do is completely blanket prohibit\n[33:41] >> because people will just you know copy\n[33:43] paste and it will be even worse. better\n[33:45] is to put in place um access meth\n[33:48] methods that you know there's outdated\n[33:50] capabilities there's observability and\n[33:53] monitoring monitoring around it so\n[33:55] there's quite a lot of companies that\n[33:56] like offering this as a security\n[33:58] solution as being an AI router that you\n[34:01] adopt and so you can see all your\n[34:03] >> but I'm always like a bit knee-jerk\n[34:06] reactionary to like process I feel like\n[34:10] you know we talked about how AI it's\n[34:12] evolving so quickly\n[34:15] And then a lot of people talk about oh\n[34:16] we need these processes in place to do\n[34:19] the things like yeah\n[34:22] we do need process we're discovering pro\n[34:25] I mean we're discovering workflows but\n[34:27] these workflows cannot be uh static they\n[34:31] have to change very quickly day by day\n[34:34] almost and yeah\n[34:35] >> security right\n[34:36] >> I don't think any company is ready for\n[34:39] that um for you know like how many it\n[34:43] it. Yeah. No company's ready for that\n[34:45] cuz process is usually something\n[34:48] enshrined in the company after some\n[34:51] debate and it's like a law and then it\n[34:53] doesn't change or you have to fight like\n[34:56] hell to change it.\n[34:58] Yeah, I think I think this is a battle\n[35:00] security always has been fighting and\n[35:03] even if you look at the recent events\n[35:05] with React,\n[35:07] it's far from over. I didn't realize\n[35:09] that the second Cloudfare outage was\n[35:12] caused by this React CVE. Did you know\n[35:14] that? Or\n[35:16] >> really? [laughter]\n[35:17] >> Yeah. So, Tio did a I have to admit it\n[35:20] now. I must be a Tio subscriber because\n[35:22] I bring him a puppy call now. [laughter]\n[35:24] >> I don't know because I watch one of them\n[35:26] now. I see all of them. So whatever hate\n[35:28] I give to Tio, I have to I have to\n[35:31] >> Well, he's one of those I mean I think\n[35:35] it's almost in the the YouTuber DNA to\n[35:38] be a little bit uh\n[35:41] controversial and disliked, you know.\n[35:44] Yeah. So anyway, he he did a really nice\n[35:46] coverage of this uh React RC and the um\n[35:49] industry response to it. to how Versel\n[35:52] and Cloudflare mitigated early against\n[35:56] this remote code execution because it's\n[35:58] a very severe bug and even even this\n[36:00] morning I saw there's another exploit\n[36:02] against the the fix. So they released\n[36:05] 16.016\n[36:07] and there's another exploit against\n[36:08] that.\n[36:09] >> But this is nothing to do with AI is it?\n[36:11] I mean\n[36:12] >> uh it's no it's not\n[36:13] >> software supply issue right?\n[36:15] >> Yeah it's a software because we talked\n[36:16] about security and and and process\n[36:18] around it. I I just thought it might be\n[36:21] relevant to bring up um that security\n[36:24] always had this battle not just with AI\n[36:26] but any type of um tools that we\n[36:30] incorporate such as adopting NexJS uh\n[36:33] and then using server components which\n[36:36] is the React part that causes all of\n[36:38] these bugs all of these exploits lately\n[36:41] and and so B apparently this was\n[36:44] responsibly disclosed by the researcher\n[36:46] who found the bug in the\n[36:49] uh protocol and then Versel and\n[36:52] Cloudflare\n[36:53] uh put firewall rules to detect the\n[36:57] payload like the attacks so they could\n[36:59] block them. So for people that did not\n[37:01] update their react or uh the moment that\n[37:04] it goes public, right, they they publish\n[37:06] the fix immediately\n[37:07] >> like intelligent firewall type thing,\n[37:10] >> right? So\n[37:11] product,\n[37:13] >> right? So they they they put the the\n[37:14] protection in the firewall. So the\n[37:16] second cloud flare outage was caused\n[37:19] because they were rolling out they had\n[37:22] to increase the buffer size of the um\n[37:25] the firewall software to be able to take\n[37:29] in a bigger context.\n[37:31] >> Yes. And then as they were rolling it\n[37:34] out it noticed some some issues. So they\n[37:36] do um a gradual roll out across the\n[37:39] regions of this like increase of buffer\n[37:41] size. But that that must be quite a\n[37:42] complicated rule like they must detect\n[37:44] somehow.\n[37:45] >> Yes. So the rule is really this react\n[37:48] version and\n[37:49] >> Yes. And apparently the rule\n[37:50] >> and it's all compile decompilation.\n[37:53] >> No no de like the rule is bloody Lua.\n[37:58] >> Yeah. L is nice and fast. It's uh\n[38:01] probably better than running shell on\n[38:03] the edge.\n[38:05] >> Yeah. But it's not better than than a\n[38:07] typed uh like language where you you\n[38:11] discover.\n[38:12] >> Um, so basically what happened is that\n[38:14] the ex the rule when they tried to roll\n[38:16] back. So the the bug the the problem the\n[38:19] outage wasn't caused by the roll out the\n[38:22] outage was caused by the roll back when\n[38:24] they they triggered the global config to\n[38:28] roll back wherever it had been out\n[38:29] rolled out and that component that does\n[38:32] the global roll out that\n[38:34] >> why did they roll back? Sorry I didn't\n[38:35] get that. So they were doing the roll\n[38:37] out of the increased buffer size to\n[38:39] capture uh to improve the firewall rules\n[38:42] and as they were rolling it out\n[38:43] gradually they noticed some issues. So\n[38:45] they wanted to roll it back but when\n[38:47] they rolled it back they didn't do a\n[38:48] gradual roll back. They just kicked off\n[38:50] this one service to do the roll back and\n[38:53] the rule engines had got into like an um\n[38:56] a state that shouldn't be possible. So\n[38:58] the execute rule was null was uh was was\n[39:01] was null but it was still loaded. So it\n[39:04] was like throwing errors. So that's kind\n[39:06] of what he was saying um was the cause.\n[39:08] So I I thought it was funny that\n[39:10] everyone's complaining about uh\n[39:12] Cloudflare two outages in in in like a\n[39:15] month. How's it possible? And it's still\n[39:16] so central to every like the internet is\n[39:18] not distributed. It's like too\n[39:20] centralized on a few big providers and\n[39:22] and how can they have two outages? And\n[39:24] it turns out that second outage was\n[39:26] caused by this React. Um,\n[39:28] >> yeah, I'm always I'm always befuddled or\n[39:32] interested in how overthe-air updates\n[39:35] work uh because I rolled my own system\n[39:37] years ago and um using Git FS and uh it\n[39:42] works really well and then and then a\n[39:44] lot of you know every company on this\n[39:46] planet now has to has to be able to ship\n[39:49] updates very effectively and roll back\n[39:51] or roll forward what what have you. And\n[39:54] um\n[39:56] most often than not then these are where\n[39:59] mistakes happen or bad implement you see\n[40:02] bad implementation but anyway\n[40:05] um it's almost time for me to run off\n[40:08] and take my kids to school.\n[40:11] >> Mhm.\n[40:12] >> Give me give me now. Okay. So I guess\n[40:15] this this chat we can call it\n[40:19] about spec kit ples workflow.\n[40:23] What did we call the last one where we\n[40:26] talked about God knows what did we talk\n[40:28] about?\n[40:30] >> Yeah.\n[40:33] >> Hey, thanks for listening to Vincent's\n[40:36] and I conversation on AI and\n[40:39] infrastructure.\n[40:41] Do please comment below on the YouTube\n[40:43] channel. Um any questions? Uh we'd love\n[40:47] to incorporate your feedback into what\n[40:49] we do. And uh this podcast, if you're\n[40:53] listening without video, is available on\n[40:55] Spotify. The website\n[40:57] thebase.com/mpodcast.\n[41:01] I think it's even available on Apple\n[41:02] Podcasts. And you can perhaps leave a\n[41:04] review. Um I don't think I've ever had a\n[41:08] review on a podcast, so go crazy. I\n[41:11] don't care.\n[41:13] just as long as I get some interaction\n[41:15] from you would be awesome so that I can\n[41:18] be enthused to keep keep carrying on\n[41:20] with uh recording our conversations and\n[41:22] and uh staying a breast of the latest AI\n[41:26] infrastructure stuff.\n[41:28] I also wanted to mention that I will be\n[41:30] in Fosdam this year in a month's time\n[41:34] and I'll also go to an infrastructure\n[41:37] centric meet uh conference called config\n[41:40] management camp. I'll mention the the\n[41:43] link in the description. Um so yeah,\n[41:47] hope to catch you up with the listeners\n[41:51] and watchers\n[41:53] then and there and in the comment\n[41:56] section and wherever. Bye.",

Optimizing AI workflows with spec\nbeat pets and beats. H Beats, baby.\nCould have fixed that one.\nI did I did see the typo at some point,\nbut I forgot. Good point. Should update\nthat.\n>> I share my workflow building a project\ncalled the grid, which involves a\nTerraform state back end. I discuss how\nI've been using and modifying specket\nfor a more advanced cloud core cloud.\n>> Yeah, I haven't updated. It's all\n>> is this generated auto by AI?\n>> Yeah, Loom. It's I'm paying for Loom.\nAnd so Loom automatically does the\ntranscripts. It's a pretty easy editing\nexperience.\n>> Oh, that's we need to do transcripts for\nthe podcast. That was my next little\nepic.\n>> Hey,\n>> I wanted to share with you my AI\nworkflow. So, I'm currently building\nsomething called the grid, which is a\n>> I always find when people show their\ntoolbar,\nit's a bit distracting.\n>> Yeah. And there's too many like um icons\non there like bookmarks. I also noticed\nit when I was rewatching.\n>> Command B. I'm always conscious.\n>> It's like it's like it's got to be a\nname for it.\n>> I know a terform state back end. It's\nnot very hip, but it's not a trivial um\nproject. So it requires a little bit\nmore advanced cloud code usage than just\ntraffic.\n>> I can't I can't help but notice this\njur.\n>> You can I never watch myself at at at\none. I always watch myself at 1.5 and\nwhen I'm edit editing I watch myself at\ntwo double speed.\n>> I find it interesting that you call opus\na planning agent.\n>> You will have a couple of\n>> a lot of people do. Yeah. Then\n>> so you you were saying that like when\nSpectit updates you update, right? But\n>> yeah, so I have a local copy of the\nprompts and I go through their change\nlog and I pull in uh and try to merge my\nchanges together with theirs. For\nexample, one of them is originally\nSpeckit generated very nonsense branch\nnames, but then they modified the script\nto um automatically like LLM create like\na nice branch name. Do you ever PR back\nsome of your suggestions back to them or\nit's like you've personalized this or\nsomething?\n>> I am thinking about it. I'm not sure. I\nI I really think it would be nice if I\ncould contribute it back and align mine\nmore with upstream. So, but I didn't\nnotice a lot of effort um lately on the\nproject. That's why I haven't um\ncontributed it back.\n>> Oh, okay. Okay.\nin my in my employer.\nI'm I'm reluctant to to name it just\nbecause I don't want to get myself in\nhot water, but we have like quite a lot\nof interesting material about how to to\nlaunch. I think we call them inceptions.\nI think uh it's it it's just how to to\nto gather requirements, NFRs. There's\nthere's a lot\nand and I can't help but think it must\nit must match well to this sort of\nstuff.\n>> This is cool. This is cool. I'm just I'm\njust thinking aloud that like uh in my\nworkplace we always have to do an ADR\nfor for things. What I don't like is\ndoing the ADR\nbefore we implement it.\nI don't know if you have any thoughts\nabout that, but I mean an arch\narchitecture decision record. Okay, this\nthis is a spec. You you're talking about\nspecs. an arch architecture decision\nrecord isn't quite the same. But anyway,\nit's just a thought at the moment. So I\njust had maybe you can dive a bit on\nthat because I just had a call as well\nuh with someone who's building more like\na multi- aent system to like when cloud\nhas completed some work kick off a\nreview agent or one or more review\nagents to get feedback and I was like\nwhy do you do the review and and\n[clears throat] then this examples he\ngave me was like\n>> the review agent needs to validate that\nthe implementation matches the user like\nuh story or the business value and I'm\nlike actually speckit inverses that and\nI feel like is it is speckit more\nwaterfall like than agile because you're\nmaking a lot of decisions up front\nyou're doing like a a resource\n>> research but I also think and I think\nthis so yes speckit is doing anversion\nof like making sure that the\nspecifications are defined first um but\nwhat speckit also does is\nit's like 70% planning 30% and um agents\nwriting code. So you do the check-in of\nthe of the specifications, the user data\nand all that and the tech research and\nthen I imagine you go off on another\nbranch, you let the agents write all the\ncode and then if you encounter any\nissues with that design, you just throw\naway because it's so easy uh and so\ncheap to generate code and you go back\nto the research and you're like, \"Hey,\nwe tried this. We we got stuck there.\nThere's some problems with this design\nbecause course adjusting midway is not\nthat easy.\" like in if I'm in the middle\nand I have like generated 20 tasks and\nthey assume that I've gone down this\npath where this file exists over there\nand that turns out to be a wrong path,\nyou must be able to backtrack. So I\nthink that's something I'm not doing\nright now because I'm trying to course\nadjust. I think specit is kind of agile\nin that way.\n>> I I don't I didn't quite get that. So\nwhen you course adjust are you saying\nthat your initial spec doesn't keep up\nthe specs don't keep up with that course\nadjustment or\n>> yeah if the whole you know idea here\nthat I'm I'm I'm highlighting why I like\nspeckit is that it goes through all of\nthe code and it highlights clearly like\nokay we're going to introduce this\nfeature and it's going to touch these\nfive components in this component we\nhave to change this in that component we\nhave to change that and there's a\ncontract between them, right? So, you\nget very small tasks and you send them\noff into agents to to to complete those\ntasks. When everything comes back, you\nshould, you know, and you're building a\nbridge, you have to meet in the middle,\nright? Not not like and\n>> so so if in the middle one guy was\nsuccessfully building against the\ncontract, but the other guy had like a\nmassive issue, maybe you need to be able\nto step back and course adjust where the\nrest of the plan is like laid out\naccording to that path. So, that's kind\nof like\n>> the hard bit about it. But I think\n>> I think you have the same if you do an\nADR right you you will have gone through\nseveral parts identifies the issues and\nbacktracked right\n>> yeah like the whole point of an ADR is\nto to be honest ADR's arch architecture\ndecision records are are different for\nevery company but the expectation in my\ncurrent gig is that they that you have\nlike three choices you you have your\nthree vendors or whatever your three\nthings and you and you basically\nshow that you that you done some due\ndiligence in comparing the three\noptions.\nSo, it's not quite it's not the same as\na spec, but I I can imagine all feeds\ninto each other because\nyeah, it's anyway, it's that's but\nanother point [snorts] of feedback that\nI got u when I explained the specket um\nworkflow to the guy who's building the\nto Zach who's building the beats uh UI.\nHe he also highlighted to me that in\nagile you will have a retrospective and\nspeckit doesn't have that retrospective\nthe way he understands it right now like\nwhere you go back and adjust the the\nprompt templates to like make sure that\nyou don't go do make those same mistakes\n>> and and then furthermore like specit is\nfor driving AI like I feel like we\nalmost need a speck it for driving\nhumans because like all these workflows\nall these things it's complicated\nWell, is it? Yeah, it is. It is. We're\nall learning here.\n>> We're all learning how to drive the AI\nand like it's it's quite it's not easy\num to keep everyone on board cuz it's\nmoving quite quickly too, you know, like\nlike I mean some of my stakeholders are\nlike non-technical like if if I go\nrampant with the AI, I mean they're not\ngoing to keep up basically.\n[snorts]\n>> Yeah. Y more areas. So one one thing\nthat's come up on my radar a lot is this\nis this term uh pro progressive\ndisclosure when you write these markdown\nfiles\nwould you say they progressively\ndisclosing the the task or how or does\nit even feature in here? I I guess the\nAI is expected to read the whole damn\nthing and the end of Right.\nSo I think that's where um beats comes\nin very nicely which I'm going to\nmention next when I show this 1,300 line\nfile which um it's beats allows the AI\nto stay focused on just um a small\nportion of the of the markdown. I don't\nthink markdown is the best way to\nprogressively\num disclose like the details. I think\nwith Beats you actually get like the\nhigh overview and you can drill down\ninto one issue and then get exactly that\nlike design acceptance criteria\n>> in in the anthropic documentation. I\nthink the I mean they don't say this but\nmy interpretation is that like with the\nskill markdown you you structure your\nmark you you structure your markdown to\nhave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 with the\nrealization that the thing might not get\nto 10 you know but anyway\n>> tasks. So you label them. Interesting.\nSo you must have a reason for labeling\nthem prereec edge status\nvalidation inference web app.\n>> So the the problem was when I was\nplaying with beats I realized that there\nwasn't really a good way to query the\nlist unless you use labels. like you can\nsee the next set of ready tasks but if\nyou have like multiple feature branches\nthen there will be a complete mixture of\ndifferent tasks in that database because\nthey are shared right it's on the root\nof the repo so if you have like multiple\nbranches but you're merging things in um\nthere is actually the beats database is\nshared this is very different between\nspecit which the task file is for one\nfeature but beats is like a central\ndatabase and and I realized you couldn't\nreally query that database case unless\nyou use labels. So labels were the only\nway to like slice and dice the the the\nissues.\n>> Yeah,\n>> fair enough. I guess I'm always thinking\nhierarchically for some reason, you\nknow, like I'm thinking epic feature du\ndu du.\n>> I will show you the the the graph in a\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, I thought you were going to mention\nBD ready, but maybe you're going to do\nthat. I mean, spec implement is BD\nready, right?\nYeah. Um, kind of it's it's you have to\naugment implement with with the next\nsteps to do. I'm I'm actually not using\nBD ready. I'm usually telling it like\nwe're going to work on user story one.\nWe're going to work on user story 2. And\nusually I want the ready to be filtered\ndown to user story one or user story 2.\nSo um they just added that with\ncapability. Before you could not um\nfilter ready by label, but now you can\nand and I updated my prompt as well like\nuse the BD ready but with these label\nfilters.\n>> It's interesting that you use user\nstories for some reason.\nI mean every every every\ncard, every task for me has a user\nstory. But I'm guessing you're using\nuser story as a more of a high level um\na high level feature that you want to\nimplement. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So basically when you run like\nspecify it's going to generate user\nstories and then it's going to create\nfunctional requirements and when I do\nafter I do the research it's going to\ngenerate the tasks and every task must\nbe backed by a functional requirement or\na user story. Right? So every task. So\nwe I I get like epic. Then I have user\nstory which is feature because um beats\nonly has like epic feature and task and\nI map them from specify um feature to\nepic and user story to feature and task\nto task. So\n>> So your task doesn't have a user story.\nIt just has like some like\n>> it's a child of a user story and has the\nlabels of the functional requirements.\n>> Interesting.\n>> Yeah. So you will see that I think when\nwhen we look at the UI like\n>> okay\n>> cuz that's the next step\n>> on the topic of context window I'm I'm\nloving how beads allows me to manage the\ncontext window loving it\nbut in the future the context is is\nbound to grow right and I'm just\nthinking to myself like I'm I'm doing\nall this effort to to to manage the\ncontext more effectively\nif you know tomorrow they they launch\nuh Claude Son 6.0 and it has like\npractically unlimited context.\nAm I like have I just wasted my time is\nis the thought that was running through\nmy mind.\n>> My thought is more more that like\nanthropic is bound to build beats into\ncloud code and bound to you know build\nspec it into cloud code so that you you\nyou know and then it's going to be their\nworkflow. Um, and you're going to map\nyours towards it.\n>> Um, so everything I\n>> Exactly. So everything I'm doing right\nnow, I keep in mind that that's just\n>> the way I'm using cloud code right now\nbecause\n>> there's no like there's some something's\nmissing, right? [snorts]\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to change.\nI mean, oh man, we're we're in for a\nfreaking ride here. That's for sure. I\nmean, like Yeah. I'm almost thinking we\ncould we could make a video every day\nabout what's going on almost.\n>> I don't really like the word toy. I\nprefer like terminal baby.\n>> Man, that's so fast.\n>> What's in progress and what has great\n>> how how is pearls implemented? Rust\n>> it's SQL light queries, right?\n>> So fast.\n>> Okay. Epic feature task. Epic feature\ntask. Cool.\n>> What does the P1 P2 What does that mean?\npriority. Um but he just did another\nupdate because um he added little status\nindicators. Um right now on the left\nside you see the tree and you see at the\ntop the little progress bar. It says I'm\n75% done with this epic. Um, if I filter\nit down and you see little like green\ncircles and little check marks next to\nto them and then if you go all the way\nto the right side, which is the type,\nyeah, there the metadata, there's\nchildren there and you can't really say\nwhich ones are closed and which ones are\nopened. Okay,\n>> so he just added that in uh this\nmorning. So now if you use PAL, you will\nsee every single one um if it's already\nclosed or not.\n>> Sweet. And but this progress bar is a\nbit aggressive, isn't it? This is for\nthe whole damn thing, right? Or does it\nget broken down depending what you're\nlooking at?\n>> Depending what you're looking at. So, if\nif you zoom in to just one phase, it's\ngoing to show the progress of that\nphase.\n>> Cool.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> It's a really good tool.\n>> What I kind of missed here when I went\nthrough them real quick, you would see\nthat every task has like the title, the\ndescription, the design, which tells you\nwhich files.\nIf you go a little bit back.\n>> Shoot.\n>> With this.\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. This one I I have to fix the\norder. Right now it's showing acceptance\ncriteria before design, but design\nshould be first. So you see the title\nthere's a little like what we're doing\nlike update the seat policy to grant the\nproduct engineer role. And then the\ndesign is you go to this migration file\nand then you add fourbin policy rules uh\nto the product engineer role. I just\nrealized changing the migration is\nprobably not the thing you want to do.\nYou should probably add a new migration.\nSo this was probably a wrong task. But\nsometimes I tell Opus like hey this is\nnowhere live. Don't need to worry about\nmigrations. Like just put all in one\nmigration because we don't have any live\nlife live data to migrate.\n>> So\n>> yeah like\n>> yeah I I couldn't help but but observe\nthat the the tasks are so actually very\ntight very tight. I like it.\n>> So finally\n>> and that's all opus opus created. So,\nOpus is creating all the tasks using\nbeats. Um and again like the concept of\nuser story it comes from specit right\nspecit creates the um creates like the\nuser stories and the functional\nrequirements and then when we go to the\nphase um sorry to the task generation it\nhas a template document and you know LLM\nare great at looking at example and\nfollowing the examples right so these\ntemplate documents like this task MD\nsays tells like any LLM really this is\nwhat I want you to do you know look at\nthe user stories break them down into\nphases when we generate task our task\nare focused like our first user story\nhere which is the MVP is to be able to\nrename a state so the first one uh no\nthe first one is the foundational phase\nand then we have user story one rename\nstate logic and under there are all the\ntasks and and and that's like P1 because\nthat's the MVP when we reach reach that\nwe can immediately like build the whole\nstack so we're building the API, the\nCLI, the SDK, I guess, everything.\n>> The the way that I've worked on software\nprojects, and I'm just sorry,\nslight tangent, is that I like to like\ndo something like Excaladraw, like draw\nthings out.\nAnd I'm just thinking aloud.\nYou know, for me looking at this, it\ndoes it does seem quite well structured,\nbut at the same time, I'm still very\ntempted to to whip out my uh you know,\npen and and paper, excal to draw things\nout a bit.\nI I don't know if that's a consideration\nwith um the visas. Anyway, side note,\n>> let's move on. Let me quickly go out of\nopen cloud last session.\n>> Oh, dash c continue.\n>> And it will show you all of the prompts\nthat I did to get the session going.\n>> Did you did you move your thing while\nrecording or did did Loom do this\nautomatically or something weird?\n>> No. No. Um I cut so my my face was over\nit and I dragged it and then when I was\nediting the video I cut the part where I\ndragged it.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So did you already put this in this?\nThis is ready running in an a as an\nagent when you do specker implement.\nOkay. So you got your terminal, you got\nyour clawed interactivity back, right?\n>> Yeah. This is a history of my prompts.\n>> Okay.\n>> So this was a a session that I just did.\nSo what I did was I opened cloud\ncontinue last session. I pressed the\ndouble escape to look at my prompt like\nhistory.\n>> Okay.\n>> There. And you see this one\n>> it literally one two three four five six\nprompts. Two of those were, you know,\nlike run the test this way and then\nupdate the memory to say like from now\non make sure you always run the test\nthis way, right? So really it was like\nthree prompts. One was showing the the\nthe actual user story which is ASC grit\nasse 3.4 and I also want beats currently\ndoes not show the comments when you do\nBD show. So I tell cloud specifically\nyou must do always show and comments so\nthat you see both because\n>> so what do you what are you using the\ncomments for just for updating and\n>> yeah so there was a problem with beats\nuh version 0.21 where BD update didn't\nwork. So after the task was created and\nI wanted to add in a note that didn't\nwork. So I I adopted this workflow of\nadding comments. So I also told Gemini\nand cloud whenever you're doing\nsomething um close the task with the\nreason why it's closed and add comments\num even when I'm doing a cross reference\ncheck like look at the the specification\nversus the plan versus the task that\nwere generated it cross spec clarify\nthen I say hey to all of these task make\nsure to add a comment to pay attention\nto use existing helpers don't rewrite\nhelpers because like I want haiku to\npick up the task know that there are\nexisting helpers and don't just build\nanother helpers. This is interesting. So\n>> I I'm more interested in the way that\nyou manage your agents because because\nlike say say you're working on your\nimplementation, you want to you want to\nspit out like three agents,\n>> don't you? And get them running in the\nbackground and then if you go control if\nyou go C, then the agents are killed or\nhow does this work?\n>> That so I tried it like three or four\ntimes and it hasn't worked well yet. So\nat this point I'm still the reason why\nyou want to run those agents in the\nbackground is that they they have their\nown little context and they can do all\nof the work and compile and verify and\nand fix.\n>> Yeah, I got that. But like how do you\nhow do you manage them like a process\ntask manager?\n>> I think cloud code not yet. Um\ndoing it\n>> a lot to do\n>> and cl code is at the forefront here. I\nmean, Codeex and Gemini haven't caught\nup in these regards, right?\n>> Well, I say that, but VS Code does have\num asynchronous uh agent support in a\nway.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm glad you you\nbasically are advertising your workflow\nhere. Oh god.\nYeah. So, Loom um they do this when you\nwhen you make a lot of videos and people\nwatch them at the end of the month. It\ngives you like, you know, gamification.\nIt tells you you have saved this many\nminutes across all of like all of the\npeople watching um minutes saved in\nmeetings and all that. So, Loom is a\nit's a pretty smart thing.\n>> Yeah, I guess um\nI mean there's a lot of like internal\nvideo sharing tools nowadays. And the\nthing that bugs me is that I usually\nlike to to record in quite high quality,\nyou know,\n>> full screen resolution. They always mess\nup. I mean, I'm I'm noticing that that\nthey cut corners there by pixelating the\nhell out of it.\n>> Um,\ncompressing the hell out of it rather.\n>> When you're going to replay this,\nnobody's going to hear what I say in the\nvideo because your voice is way louder\nthan than the video. So, you may need to\nlike, I don't know, play with the audio\nif you want people to hear or copy over\nthe audio track. I don't know. Um,\n>> from my point of view just now when I\nwas I was listening.\n>> True. We didn't I didn't record the\naudio. Oh [ __ ]\n>> Maybe on your machine it's recording my\nvoice louder together with your voice,\nbut on me watching it through Zoom, I\ndidn't hear myself very clearly. But uh\nyeah, I don't know. You can always work\non that\n>> when you when you do a share.\nI I should have made sure that I was\nrecording the uh Oh, yeah. Maybe could\nif you could. But how the hell am I I'm\ngoing to sync up the video. This\n>> I can download the MP4 and then you can\nsplit the audio from the video if you\nwant.\n>> Oh, no. This is This sounds hard. Okay.\nWell, I'll I'll try. Good luck.\n>> Let's see what what what was capt.\n>> So, can you talk about I thought it was\nquite exciting that you talked to the\nthe guy behind uh Zack behind Polas.\nCould you could you uh share what he\nsaid or was that a bit too uh\n>> No. Um basically\nbecause I'm I'm using it and I'm sharing\nthese really complicated di like\ndependency graphs right you see the tree\nis very complicated and he's asking me\nlike what what are you doing that\n[laughter] you have such a complicated\n>> task um you know diagram that's what\n>> um yeah so he was asking like is this\nlike across like multiple repositories\nis like a central database he just\nwanted to understand a little bit more\nhow I was using beats\nand we talked about a lot of things, but\nhe was very um you know bullish on beats\nbeing really one of the core ways that\nyou know agent memory will be you know\nhandled and context will be managed.\n>> I mean I don't know of anything better.\nI mean beads is next level. I saw just\nfunny on on LinkedIn the other day,\nBeans announced and I thought like they\nmade a typo, right? And they said it\nlike three times and Beans is the\nanother tool which is to give context to\nyour agent, but it's using like markdown\nas a as a as a storage mechanism. I was\nlike, what are they doing? They're\ncopying the name and they're not even\nusing it, dude.\nAnyway, no, but he's adding some really\ncool stuff and he's saying all of it is\na lot of it is opus and um he has a very\nlike good vision on the product. Like I\ndid some PRs where I tried to change\nthings and he was like um I don't really\nlike that. I think we can do it better\nif we do like this and like that. And\nthen he just went off and he did his\nthing and it's like yeah that's way\nbetter. That's like really nice.\n>> What do you mean like a product like\n>> Yeah. user experience like and the BQL.\nIf you like Jira, I think you're going\nto love Beats because it has this query\nlanguage and I didn't throw that in my\ndemo, but you can create\n>> I'm aware I I use the the Jira query\nlanguage with this weird plugin. Uh I'm\ntrying to remember the name of the\nplugin. So, what do you mean? So, you\nwere chatting with him and he came\nacross as a as a better product owner.\nSo, he was what refining the user\nstories or he had a different\n>> Yeah. I I did a couple of pull requests,\nright? And then he always asked the\nquestion like what is it that you're\ntrying to achieve like and are there\nother ways? And he's always thinking\nabout the most logical way. For example,\nI added a tree to the to the details\nview. But then we both kind of realized\nit made more sense if you're on the Kbar\nKBAN view like when you see the columns\nand you want you're on one of those\nissues, you want to press T and you get\nimmediately the full tree.\n>> You're talking about per you're not\ntalking about the grid, right?\n>> Yeah. No, no, purely about per pearls,\nhis product.\n>> Pearl. Sorry.\n>> We didn't talk about mine. We talked\nabout Per.\n>> Okay. So, you were So, he he had he had\na strong vision about how everything\nshould I mean I mean his is his baby. I\nmean, he's probably spent many hours uh\nthinking about it. Like any I I often\nfeel like the barrier to entry when you\nwhen you like introduce like a junior to\na project like the the junior is going\nto get like bombed out the water, right?\nBecause Yeah. didn't you think about\nthis? Like, no, I've only been thinking\n20 minutes about this product.\n[laughter]\n>> Uh, yeah. No, he has, of course, he\nknows also because he added this idea.\nOriginally, he had the columns and then\nhe has this query language which has\nlike a lexer and a parser. It's really\nnice and it translates to Yeah, it's\nlike a query lang language that\ntranslates down to SQL queries into the\nthe the issue database. If you go to um\n>> it's up there in under internal there's\na whole implementation.\n>> Okay. So he's using it for the for\ndifferent views and okay\n>> he has the idea of the expand down and\nexpand up and I saw it in his code when\nI added the tree view. Um I used the\nexpand to expand. Uh but I added\nsomething different and then he said the\nwhole idea behind expand was to create\nthose type of trees within the columns.\nUm, but it kind of evolved now. Like you\nhave the combine board. When you go into\ndetails, you see the the the tree on the\nside as you as you saw in what I just\nshowed you. But like\n>> since yesterday he had a topo sorting,\nhe added labeling like more indications.\n>> Well, I mean that kind of like\n>> if he's adding a ton of features, then I\nfeel like that means people are going to\nuse pearles in like a million different\nways. And I'm I'm all I I'm kind of\nthinking like a prescribed, you know,\nworkflow is somehow is what I'm looking\nfor. like I I don't want too much\nvariability, you know, because you can\n>> projects\n>> to to like give actually what you and I\ntalked about about how to package up\nyour skills, your plugins and your\ntools, everything as a bundle, which he\nalso said like I want to onboard the\nengineering team, 6,000 people at the\ncompany he's working at to to adopt LLM\nworkflows.\n>> So, what was his position in the\ncompany? Is he just like a lowly\nengineer or?\n>> No, [clears throat] he's like director\nlevel, I think. Uh,\n>> really?\n>> Yeah. But\n>> who does he work for? I mean, what is\nhis company?\n>> Click on his profile. Says Square, which\nis now Box. It's a Fortune 500. And And\n>> you mean Square the gaming company?\n>> No. Uh, no. It's a\nit's it's it's\n>> And this guy is French, I guess.\n>> No, he's from the US. He just likes\nFrench words.\nOkay. Um All right. So, he works for big\norganiz So, he's Yeah, I'm I'm actually\nfascinated by the human aspect to it\nbecause because Yeah, like how do we get\npeople adopting these workflows in in an\nengineering organization? he has the\nsame problem and there's I think quite a\nfew people\n>> a lot of people are looking at how to\nbuild out um\nadoption internally um matching internal\num quality standards right\nyeah\nI mean like there was a blog\nuh hold on let me stop my share because\nI'm probably going to share something\ncrazy\num\nLike I mean I think I can say this. I'm\ngoing to say it anyway. Like at my in my\nat my current client, we have so much\nproblems about just administering\nGitHub. Like people a lot of people\ndon't know who the who the hell is\nadministrating it. No one can seem to\ndecide whether copilot is an acceptable\nrisk. So some people are are using it.\nSome people are not allowed to use it. I\nI got this email 16 hours ago. It's from\nGitHub. I don't know if you can see it,\nbut basically it says like fine grain\ncontrol um delegate AI management. I'm\nthinking this is actually a fantastic\nthing for my current gig because because\nno one wants wants to have the\nresponsibility uh to to do this. So if\nthis can be employed, I'm thinking yay\n>> dedicated team.\nWell, I mean it's it's sad, but like I\nmean what I'm trying to say is that like\nwe're hardly even out the gates with my\nclient um never mind pearles, you know,\nit's it's really sad like like MC uh MCP\naccess is um disabled and I and I asked\nuh one of the guys why is MCP able um\ndisabled? He says oh because it can\nharvest your code and I was like m and\nMCP is for uh tool tool calls not for\nharvesting code. He says oh if you use\nthe GitHub MCP it will harvest your code\nand I'm like what\nthe the protocol is insecure. I don't I\nmean the protocol\n>> there's a lot of security blocks about\nthe ma massive gaps in in MCP servers.\nUm I I I can understand from a security\nperspective it has been a nightmare.\nEveryone just running Do you think do\nyou think the tool call will somehow ask\nask the AI to to basically upload the\ncode or something crazy? uh prompt\ninjection there can be you know these\ntools inject instructions into your\ncontext and it can tell the they they\nhave all\n>> so you're saying that with if if you if\nif um you're in a big company\n>> and\n>> yeah malicious MCPs or malicious\ncontributors to MCPs\n>> but isn't but isn't that like the case\nfor any dependency really but like like\nlike this person was worried about the\nGitHub MCP and like we're using GitHub\nhow can be worried about the GitHub MCP.\nIt's like integrated in VS Code. I was\nlike mind blown.\n>> Yeah, it's true.\n>> Yeah, I I don't know. It's\n[sighs]\n>> I guess it's just one of those risk\nmanagement things, but it's someone just\nneeds to do the work, I suppose. Um\nyeah, so I'm glad to see this update\nfrom from GitHub. That should make\nthings easier.\nAnd um yeah, I guess we're in for a wild\nride of trying to get people to adopt\neverything,\n>> trying to manage the adoption as well,\nright? Trying to make sure that um it's\nI think we talked about this as well in\nthe past. Um the worst thing a company\ncan do is completely blanket prohibit\n>> because people will just you know copy\npaste and it will be even worse. better\nis to put in place um access meth\nmethods that you know there's outdated\ncapabilities there's observability and\nmonitoring monitoring around it so\nthere's quite a lot of companies that\nlike offering this as a security\nsolution as being an AI router that you\nadopt and so you can see all your\n>> but I'm always like a bit knee-jerk\nreactionary to like process I feel like\nyou know we talked about how AI it's\nevolving so quickly\nAnd then a lot of people talk about oh\nwe need these processes in place to do\nthe things like yeah\nwe do need process we're discovering pro\nI mean we're discovering workflows but\nthese workflows cannot be uh static they\nhave to change very quickly day by day\nalmost and yeah\n>> security right\n>> I don't think any company is ready for\nthat um for you know like how many it\nit. Yeah. No company's ready for that\ncuz process is usually something\nenshrined in the company after some\ndebate and it's like a law and then it\ndoesn't change or you have to fight like\nhell to change it.\nYeah, I think I think this is a battle\nsecurity always has been fighting and\neven if you look at the recent events\nwith React,\nit's far from over. I didn't realize\nthat the second Cloudfare outage was\ncaused by this React CVE. Did you know\nthat? Or\n>> really? [laughter]\n>> Yeah. So, Tio did a I have to admit it\nnow. I must be a Tio subscriber because\nI bring him a puppy call now. [laughter]\n>> I don't know because I watch one of them\nnow. I see all of them. So whatever hate\nI give to Tio, I have to I have to\n>> Well, he's one of those I mean I think\nit's almost in the the YouTuber DNA to\nbe a little bit uh\ncontroversial and disliked, you know.\nYeah. So anyway, he he did a really nice\ncoverage of this uh React RC and the um\nindustry response to it. to how Versel\nand Cloudflare mitigated early against\nthis remote code execution because it's\na very severe bug and even even this\nmorning I saw there's another exploit\nagainst the the fix. So they released\n16.016\nand there's another exploit against\nthat.\n>> But this is nothing to do with AI is it?\nI mean\n>> uh it's no it's not\n>> software supply issue right?\n>> Yeah it's a software because we talked\nabout security and and and process\naround it. I I just thought it might be\nrelevant to bring up um that security\nalways had this battle not just with AI\nbut any type of um tools that we\nincorporate such as adopting NexJS uh\nand then using server components which\nis the React part that causes all of\nthese bugs all of these exploits lately\nand and so B apparently this was\nresponsibly disclosed by the researcher\nwho found the bug in the\nuh protocol and then Versel and\nCloudflare\nuh put firewall rules to detect the\npayload like the attacks so they could\nblock them. So for people that did not\nupdate their react or uh the moment that\nit goes public, right, they they publish\nthe fix immediately\n>> like intelligent firewall type thing,\n>> right? So\nproduct,\n>> right? So they they they put the the\nprotection in the firewall. So the\nsecond cloud flare outage was caused\nbecause they were rolling out they had\nto increase the buffer size of the um\nthe firewall software to be able to take\nin a bigger context.\n>> Yes. And then as they were rolling it\nout it noticed some some issues. So they\ndo um a gradual roll out across the\nregions of this like increase of buffer\nsize. But that that must be quite a\ncomplicated rule like they must detect\nsomehow.\n>> Yes. So the rule is really this react\nversion and\n>> Yes. And apparently the rule\n>> and it's all compile decompilation.\n>> No no de like the rule is bloody Lua.\n>> Yeah. L is nice and fast. It's uh\nprobably better than running shell on\nthe edge.\n>> Yeah. But it's not better than than a\ntyped uh like language where you you\ndiscover.\n>> Um, so basically what happened is that\nthe ex the rule when they tried to roll\nback. So the the bug the the problem the\noutage wasn't caused by the roll out the\noutage was caused by the roll back when\nthey they triggered the global config to\nroll back wherever it had been out\nrolled out and that component that does\nthe global roll out that\n>> why did they roll back? Sorry I didn't\nget that. So they were doing the roll\nout of the increased buffer size to\ncapture uh to improve the firewall rules\nand as they were rolling it out\ngradually they noticed some issues. So\nthey wanted to roll it back but when\nthey rolled it back they didn't do a\ngradual roll back. They just kicked off\nthis one service to do the roll back and\nthe rule engines had got into like an um\na state that shouldn't be possible. So\nthe execute rule was null was uh was was\nwas null but it was still loaded. So it\nwas like throwing errors. So that's kind\nof what he was saying um was the cause.\nSo I I thought it was funny that\neveryone's complaining about uh\nCloudflare two outages in in in like a\nmonth. How's it possible? And it's still\nso central to every like the internet is\nnot distributed. It's like too\ncentralized on a few big providers and\nand how can they have two outages? And\nit turns out that second outage was\ncaused by this React. Um,\n>> yeah, I'm always I'm always befuddled or\ninterested in how overthe-air updates\nwork uh because I rolled my own system\nyears ago and um using Git FS and uh it\nworks really well and then and then a\nlot of you know every company on this\nplanet now has to has to be able to ship\nupdates very effectively and roll back\nor roll forward what what have you. And\num\nmost often than not then these are where\nmistakes happen or bad implement you see\nbad implementation but anyway\num it's almost time for me to run off\nand take my kids to school.\n>> Mhm.\n>> Give me give me now. Okay. So I guess\nthis this chat we can call it\nabout spec kit ples workflow.\nWhat did we call the last one where we\ntalked about God knows what did we talk\nabout?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hey, thanks for listening to Vincent's\nand I conversation on AI and\ninfrastructure.\nDo please comment below on the YouTube\nchannel. Um any questions? Uh we'd love\nto incorporate your feedback into what\nwe do. And uh this podcast, if you're\nlistening without video, is available on\nSpotify. The website\nthebase.com/mpodcast.\nI think it's even available on Apple\nPodcasts. And you can perhaps leave a\nreview. Um I don't think I've ever had a\nreview on a podcast, so go crazy. I\ndon't care.\njust as long as I get some interaction\nfrom you would be awesome so that I can\nbe enthused to keep keep carrying on\nwith uh recording our conversations and\nand uh staying a breast of the latest AI\ninfrastructure stuff.\nI also wanted to mention that I will be\nin Fosdam this year in a month's time\nand I'll also go to an infrastructure\ncentric meet uh conference called config\nmanagement camp. I'll mention the the\nlink in the description. Um so yeah,\nhope to catch you up with the listeners\nand watchers\nthen and there and in the comment\nsection and wherever. Bye.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–3:41]\nfree tech shirts. Okay. Optimizing AI workflows with spec beat pets and beats. H Beats, baby. Could have fixed that one. I did I did see the typo at some point, but I forgot. Good point. Should update that. >> I share my workflow building a project called the grid, which involves a Terraform state back end. I discuss how I've been using and modifying specket for a more advanced cloud core cloud. >> Yeah, I haven't updated. It's all >> is this generated auto by AI? >> Yeah, Loom. It's I'm paying for Loom. And so Loom automatically does the transcripts. It's a pretty easy editing experience. >> Oh, that's we need to do transcripts for the podcast. That was my next little epic. >> Hey, >> I wanted to share with you my AI workflow. So, I'm currently building something called the grid, which is a >> I always find when people show their toolbar, it's a bit distracting. >> Yeah. And there's too many like um icons on there like bookmarks. I also noticed it when I was rewatching. >> Command B. I'm always conscious. >> It's like it's like it's got to be a name for it. >> I know a terform state back end. It's not very hip, but it's not a trivial um project. So it requires a little bit more advanced cloud code usage than just traffic. >> I can't I can't help but notice this jur. >> You can I never watch myself at at at one. I always watch myself at 1.5 and when I'm edit editing I watch myself at two double speed. >> I find it interesting that you call opus a planning agent. >> You will have a couple of >> a lot of people do. Yeah. Then >> so you you were saying that like when Spectit updates you update, right? But >> yeah, so I have a local copy of the prompts and I go through their change log and I pull in uh and try to merge my changes together with theirs. For example, one of them is originally Speckit generated very nonsense branch names, but then they modified the script to um automatically like LLM create like a nice branch name. Do you ever PR back some of your suggestions back to them or it's like you've personalized this or something? >> I am thinking about it. I'm not sure. I I I really think it would be nice if I could contribute it back and align mine more with upstream. So, but I didn't notice a lot of effort um lately on the project. That's why I haven't um contributed it back. >> Oh, okay. Okay. in my in my employer. I'm I'm reluctant to to name it just because I don't want to get myself in hot water, but we have like quite a lot of interesting…\n\n[slide:2] [3:20–10:44]\nfor for things. What I don't like is doing the ADR before we implement it. I don't know if you have any thoughts about that, but I mean an arch architecture decision record. Okay, this this is a spec. You you're talking about specs. an arch architecture decision record isn't quite the same. But anyway, it's just a thought at the moment. So I just had maybe you can dive a bit on that because I just had a call as well uh with someone who's building more like a multi- aent system to like when cloud has completed some work kick off a review agent or one or more review agents to get feedback and I was like why do you do the review and and [clears throat] then this examples he gave me was like >> the review agent needs to validate that the implementation matches the user like uh story or the business value and I'm like actually speckit inverses that and I feel like is it is speckit more waterfall like than agile because you're making a lot of decisions up front you're doing like a a resource >> research but I also think and I think this so yes speckit is doing anversion of like making sure that the specifications are defined first um but what speckit also does is it's like 70% planning 30% and um agents writing code. So you do the check-in of the of the specifications, the user data and all that and the tech research and then I imagine you go off on another branch, you let the agents write all the code and then if you encounter any issues with that design, you just throw away because it's so easy uh and so cheap to generate code and you go back to the research and you're like, \"Hey, we tried this. We we got stuck there. There's some problems with this design because course adjusting midway is not that easy.\" like in if I'm in the middle and I have like generated 20 tasks and they assume that I've gone down this path where this file exists over there and that turns out to be a wrong path, you must be able to backtrack. So I think that's something I'm not doing right now because I'm trying to course adjust. I think specit is kind of agile in that way. >> I I don't I didn't quite get that. So when you course adjust are you saying that your initial spec doesn't keep up the specs don't keep up with that course adjustment or >> yeah if the whole you know idea here that I'm I'm I'm highlighting why I like speckit is that it goes through all of the code and it highlights clearly like okay we're going to introduce this feature and it's going to touch these five…\n\n[slide:3] [10:24–17:44]\nreally query that database case unless you use labels. So labels were the only way to like slice and dice the the the issues. >> Yeah, >> fair enough. I guess I'm always thinking hierarchically for some reason, you know, like I'm thinking epic feature du du du. >> I will show you the the the graph in a >> Yeah. >> Oh, I thought you were going to mention BD ready, but maybe you're going to do that. I mean, spec implement is BD ready, right? Yeah. Um, kind of it's it's you have to augment implement with with the next steps to do. I'm I'm actually not using BD ready. I'm usually telling it like we're going to work on user story one. We're going to work on user story 2. And usually I want the ready to be filtered down to user story one or user story 2. So um they just added that with capability. Before you could not um filter ready by label, but now you can and and I updated my prompt as well like use the BD ready but with these label filters. >> It's interesting that you use user stories for some reason. I mean every every every card, every task for me has a user story. But I'm guessing you're using user story as a more of a high level um a high level feature that you want to implement. Okay. >> Yeah. So basically when you run like specify it's going to generate user stories and then it's going to create functional requirements and when I do after I do the research it's going to generate the tasks and every task must be backed by a functional requirement or a user story. Right? So every task. So we I I get like epic. Then I have user story which is feature because um beats only has like epic feature and task and I map them from specify um feature to epic and user story to feature and task to task. So >> So your task doesn't have a user story. It just has like some like >> it's a child of a user story and has the labels of the functional requirements. >> Interesting. >> Yeah. So you will see that I think when when we look at the UI like >> okay >> cuz that's the next step >> on the topic of context window I'm I'm loving how beads allows me to manage the context window loving it but in the future the context is is bound to grow right and I'm just thinking to myself like I'm I'm doing all this effort to to to manage the context more effectively if you know tomorrow they they launch uh Claude Son 6.0 and it has like practically unlimited context. Am I like have I just wasted my time is is the thought that was running through my mind. >> My thought is more more…\n\n[slide:4] [17:24–24:40]\nrename a state so the first one uh no the first one is the foundational phase and then we have user story one rename state logic and under there are all the tasks and and and that's like P1 because that's the MVP when we reach reach that we can immediately like build the whole stack so we're building the API, the CLI, the SDK, I guess, everything. >> The the way that I've worked on software projects, and I'm just sorry, slight tangent, is that I like to like do something like Excaladraw, like draw things out. And I'm just thinking aloud. You know, for me looking at this, it does it does seem quite well structured, but at the same time, I'm still very tempted to to whip out my uh you know, pen and and paper, excal to draw things out a bit. I I don't know if that's a consideration with um the visas. Anyway, side note, >> let's move on. Let me quickly go out of open cloud last session. >> Oh, dash c continue. >> And it will show you all of the prompts that I did to get the session going. >> Did you did you move your thing while recording or did did Loom do this automatically or something weird? >> No. No. Um I cut so my my face was over it and I dragged it and then when I was editing the video I cut the part where I dragged it. >> Yeah. >> So did you already put this in this? This is ready running in an a as an agent when you do specker implement. Okay. So you got your terminal, you got your clawed interactivity back, right? >> Yeah. This is a history of my prompts. >> Okay. >> So this was a a session that I just did. So what I did was I opened cloud continue last session. I pressed the double escape to look at my prompt like history. >> Okay. >> There. And you see this one >> it literally one two three four five six prompts. Two of those were, you know, like run the test this way and then update the memory to say like from now on make sure you always run the test this way, right? So really it was like three prompts. One was showing the the the actual user story which is ASC grit asse 3.4 and I also want beats currently does not show the comments when you do BD show. So I tell cloud specifically you must do always show and comments so that you see both because >> so what do you what are you using the comments for just for updating and >> yeah so there was a problem with beats uh version 0.21 where BD update didn't work. So after the task was created and I wanted to add in a note that didn't work. So I I adopted this workflow of adding comments. So I also…\n\n[slide:5] [24:20–31:40]\nwanted to understand a little bit more how I was using beats and we talked about a lot of things, but he was very um you know bullish on beats being really one of the core ways that you know agent memory will be you know handled and context will be managed. >> I mean I don't know of anything better. I mean beads is next level. I saw just funny on on LinkedIn the other day, Beans announced and I thought like they made a typo, right? And they said it like three times and Beans is the another tool which is to give context to your agent, but it's using like markdown as a as a as a storage mechanism. I was like, what are they doing? They're copying the name and they're not even using it, dude. Anyway, no, but he's adding some really cool stuff and he's saying all of it is a lot of it is opus and um he has a very like good vision on the product. Like I did some PRs where I tried to change things and he was like um I don't really like that. I think we can do it better if we do like this and like that. And then he just went off and he did his thing and it's like yeah that's way better. That's like really nice. >> What do you mean like a product like >> Yeah. user experience like and the BQL. If you like Jira, I think you're going to love Beats because it has this query language and I didn't throw that in my demo, but you can create >> I'm aware I I use the the Jira query language with this weird plugin. Uh I'm trying to remember the name of the plugin. So, what do you mean? So, you were chatting with him and he came across as a as a better product owner. So, he was what refining the user stories or he had a different >> Yeah. I I did a couple of pull requests, right? And then he always asked the question like what is it that you're trying to achieve like and are there other ways? And he's always thinking about the most logical way. For example, I added a tree to the to the details view. But then we both kind of realized it made more sense if you're on the Kbar KBAN view like when you see the columns and you want you're on one of those issues, you want to press T and you get immediately the full tree. >> You're talking about per you're not talking about the grid, right? >> Yeah. No, no, purely about per pearls, his product. >> Pearl. Sorry. >> We didn't talk about mine. We talked about Per. >> Okay. So, you were So, he he had he had a strong vision about how everything should I mean I mean his is his baby. I mean, he's probably spent many hours uh thinking about…\n\n[slide:6] [31:20–35:40]\nwe're hardly even out the gates with my client um never mind pearles, you know, it's it's really sad like like MC uh MCP access is um disabled and I and I asked uh one of the guys why is MCP able um disabled? He says oh because it can harvest your code and I was like m and MCP is for uh tool tool calls not for harvesting code. He says oh if you use the GitHub MCP it will harvest your code and I'm like what the the protocol is insecure. I don't I mean the protocol >> there's a lot of security blocks about the ma massive gaps in in MCP servers. Um I I I can understand from a security perspective it has been a nightmare. Everyone just running Do you think do you think the tool call will somehow ask ask the AI to to basically upload the code or something crazy? uh prompt injection there can be you know these tools inject instructions into your context and it can tell the they they have all >> so you're saying that with if if you if if um you're in a big company >> and >> yeah malicious MCPs or malicious contributors to MCPs >> but isn't but isn't that like the case for any dependency really but like like like this person was worried about the GitHub MCP and like we're using GitHub how can be worried about the GitHub MCP. It's like integrated in VS Code. I was like mind blown. >> Yeah, it's true. >> Yeah, I I don't know. It's [sighs] >> I guess it's just one of those risk management things, but it's someone just needs to do the work, I suppose. Um yeah, so I'm glad to see this update from from GitHub. That should make things easier. And um yeah, I guess we're in for a wild ride of trying to get people to adopt everything, >> trying to manage the adoption as well, right? Trying to make sure that um it's I think we talked about this as well in the past. Um the worst thing a company can do is completely blanket prohibit >> because people will just you know copy paste and it will be even worse. better is to put in place um access meth methods that you know there's outdated capabilities there's observability and monitoring monitoring around it so there's quite a lot of companies that like offering this as a security solution as being an AI router that you adopt and so you can see all your >> but I'm always like a bit knee-jerk reactionary to like process I feel like you know we talked about how AI it's evolving so quickly And then a lot of people talk about oh we need these…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This discussion explores advanced AI-driven development workflows, focusing on the integration of tools like Speckit, Beads, and Perles to manage complex infrastructure projects. The speakers detail how these tools shift the balance of software engineering toward rigorous planning and automated execution, allowing developers to handle sophisticated tasks such as building a Terraform state back end with high precision.\n\n[slide:1]\n## Advanced AI Workflows and The Grid\nThe primary project discussed is \"The Grid,\" a Terraform state back end that requires more advanced cloud code usage than typical web traffic applications. The developer explains his workflow using Speckit, a tool he has customized by maintaining a local copy of prompts and merging them with upstream changes from the project's changelog. One significant modification involved improving the branch naming logic; while the original tool generated nonsensical names, the developer updated the scripts to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create descriptive, context-aware branch names. He views Claude Opus not merely as a coding assistant but as a planning agent capable of structuring the entire development lifecycle. The conversation touches on the importance of contributing these personalizations back to the open-source community, though the developer notes a recent lack of activity in the upstream repository. The workflow is designed to handle non-trivial cloud infrastructure, moving beyond simple automation to manage the intricate state requirements of Terraform.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Planning Inversion and Agile Backtracking\nA central theme is the \"inversion\" of traditional development cycles. The speaker argues that AI workflows should be approximately 70% planning and 30% agent-led coding. This approach mirrors the use of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) but applies them more dynamically. *It's like 70% planning 30% and agents writing code.* By defining specifications, user data, and technical research upfront, the developer creates a contract that agents must follow. This method allows for a unique form of agility: because generating code is inexpensive and fast, a developer can \"throw away\" an entire branch if the implementation hits a design flaw and return to the research phase to course-correct. The speaker uses a bridge-building analogy, noting that while agents work on separate components, they must meet in the middle according to the predefined contract. If one side of the bridge encounters a massive issue, the developer must be able to step back and adjust the entire plan rather than trying to fix the code mid-stream.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Context Management with Beads and Perles\nThe discussion introduces Beads (also referred to as Beats) and Perles as essential tools for managing the limited context windows of current AI models. *Beads allows me to manage the context window loving it but in the future the context is bound to grow.* While Speckit creates task files for specific features, Beads acts as a central database for the entire repository, allowing developers to slice and dice issues using labels. This is particularly useful for querying the next set of \"ready\" tasks across multiple feature branches. The speaker maps the hierarchy of his project by translating Speckit's features into epics, user stories into features, and specific actions into tasks. This structured approach ensures that every task is backed by a functional requirement. There is a forward-looking concern that as models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 evolve toward \"unlimited\" context, the manual effort of managing context might become obsolete, though the speakers suspect these workflows will eventually be integrated directly into core development environments.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Agent Memory and Terminal Interactivity\nThe developer demonstrates a highly interactive terminal workflow using a \"continue last session\" feature to maintain prompt history. By using a double-escape shortcut, he can review the sequence of prompts that drove a specific session, such as running tests or updating agent memory. He emphasizes the importance of \"progressive disclosure\" in markdown files, where the AI is given only the necessary details for a specific task to keep it focused. To prevent agents from reinventing the wheel, he adds specific comments to tasks instructing the AI to use existing helpers rather than writing new ones. The workflow involves a foundational phase followed by specific user stories, such as \"rename state logic,\" which serves as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This phase-based approach allows the developer to build the entire stack—API, CLI, and SDK—simultaneously. He also notes the utility of status indicators and progress bars in the UI, which show the completion percentage of specific epics and phases.\n\n[slide:5]\n## The Vision for Perles and BQL\nThe speakers recount a conversation with Zack, the creator of Perles and a director-level engineer at a major Fortune 500 company. Zack is \"bullish\" on the idea that structured databases like Beads will become the core of agent memory and context management. Perles features a sophisticated query language known as BQL (Beats Query Language), which includes a lexer and parser that translates queries into SQL for the issue database. This allows for advanced views, such as a Kanban board that can instantly transition into a full dependency tree by pressing a specific key. Zack's vision involves onboarding thousands of engineers to these LLM-driven workflows, focusing on the most logical ways to handle complex task diagrams. The tool has evolved to include topological sorting and detailed metadata, such as whether a child task is closed or open. The speaker notes that Zack acts as a strong product owner, often refining user requests to find the most efficient implementation rather than simply adding requested features.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Security Hurdles and Corporate AI Adoption\nThe final segment addresses the challenges of implementing these AI workflows within large engineering organizations. A major point of contention is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which some security teams disable due to fears of code harvesting or prompt injection. The speaker argues that blanket prohibitions are counterproductive, as they often drive employees to use less secure \"copy-paste\" methods. Instead, companies should implement AI routers that provide observability, monitoring, and fine-grained access control. The conversation highlights a recent Cloudflare outage as a cautionary tale; the incident was triggered by a botched rollback of firewall rules designed to mitigate a React remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This illustrates the complexity of modern software supply chains and the need for robust process management. The speakers conclude that while AI is evolving rapidly, corporate processes must remain flexible enough to adopt new workflows day-by-day rather than remaining static and enshrined in outdated security policies."
