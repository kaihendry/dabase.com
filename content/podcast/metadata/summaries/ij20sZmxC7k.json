    "content": "Transcript:\nGood morning. It's 7:22 here in the UK\nand you're listening to the AI\ninfrastructure podcast.\nVincent should be joining me soon from\nVietnam and we chat about infrastructure\nbecause we're both infrastructure\nengineers and we both love AI. So, we\njust talk about AI too and what's\nhappening.\nTo get hold of us, uh, my email is\nhenry.fe.\nI'm on uh\nx.com kaihendry.\nThe website for the podcast is\ndebase.com/mpodcast.\nd a b- s.com/mpodcast.\nPlease like which comment\notherwise\nplease do enjoy the conversation.\n>> How are you? Can you hear me\n>> finally?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Sorry. How long have you been waiting?\n>> Oh, just a couple minutes. Just waking\nup slowly.\n>> 22. Yeah, you're earlier than usual\nright now. You were waiting 5 minutes.\n>> Um,\n>> do you have time to look at all the\nthings I added into the document?\n>> Yeah,\n>> I was just uh waking up study and wasn't\nHD.\nOkay, let's have a look at the document.\nWhoa,\nthere we have some. Can I share it on\nthe screen?\n>> Sure.\n>> Uh,\nI see Theo's beautiful face.\n>> Yeah, I guess if we're going to keep\nquoting him, we should give him some\ncredit, right?\n>> The fact is I I was like this morning\nwhen I woke up. Sorry.\n>> We're like the number one Theo fans.\nIt's like we talk about it.\n>> Yeah, we're we're now doing what is this\nformat where we just watch a video and\nreact to it.\n>> Yeah, we should react to Theo videos.\n>> I picked up a couple of things that I\nthought are so true. Uh what he said\nthat I've I feel the same way. Um and\nthen Primogen had me laughing out loud\nquite a few times related to the\nentropic move of blocking third party\naccess. to their um you know\nsubscription plans which was also very\nfunny.\n>> Yeah. Like on the on the news front I\nguess\num\nI guess I've been I've been watching\nthat Jeffrey Huntley. Oh no, I I can't\nremember his name. The guy the guy that\ninvented Ralph which\n>> is it the human layers the No, that's a\ndifferent dude. Okay.\n>> No. Um, yeah. If I look at my Oh, no.\nI'm sure I want to show my my history.\nIt's probably quite dark.\nIt's very dark. Oh. Oh my god. Warren's\nabs. Um, this guy.\n>> Yeah. Jeffrey Huntley. He he he's he's\nthe the guy behind Ralph and he uh has\nthese kind of weird videos where he\ntalks about\nRalph and what you need to know about\nagents, but he doesn't really ever get\nto the point or into the details of\nanything. It's kind of weird.\n>> He's using Starship on his terminal.\n>> Oh yeah, Starship. I've stopped using\nStarship, actually. Uh\num but the thing that bothers me about\nRalph is that I I don't quite understand\nhow it doesn't really give you a\nframework for generating the tasks. So,\n>> right. Yeah, I know.\n>> So, basically you're you're back at\nspecket looking back at specket or um\n>> or I guess you could just use plan to do\nit, but whatever.\n>> When I when we talked about it, I wasn't\nvery clear because I mentioned it's just\na loop and you just ask the agent to\nlike find more work and continue. But\none of the biggest uh differences is in\nin a traditional way that you use AI and\nyou know with the planning tool and the\nto-do you create a couple of sequential\ntasks and you complete them one by one.\nBut with Ralph, you delegate that uh\ntask generation. You don't tell it the\norder or maybe you um the whole idea is\nthat you're able to insert tasks in the\nmiddle. Like it's another pre um\npredefined sequence of steps. And that's\nsomething that we didn't cover. Like I\nsaw a video at that time that that went\ninto detail about like what why Ralph\nWigum is so good. Um because it um it\nfetches work. But but we already do that\nwith with Beats, right? And Gasttown is\nbasically doing like Ralph but at the\nparallel level.\n>> Yeah. It's funny how like I mean inside\nmy consultancy company which which I\nwon't name but I feel like you know they\ntalk about problems and I think like gez\njust use beads just use beads and you\nthis problem would be solved.\n>> Anyway,\n>> persistent man.\n>> So um yeah where do you want to start?\nDo you want to start at the bottom here?\n>> Well, maybe you need to go up a bit\nbecause if so, the first thing uh AI\nhandles coding humans think. Um, one of\nthe things that also this week was very,\nyou know, interesting in the in the\ninternet reaction. Of course, cloud uh\nwhat is it? co- code or co-work being\nannounced and and and basically the team\nBoris again saying we built in a week\nand a half using cloud code mostly um\nbring cloud code workflows. Yeah, of\ncourse we built it in a week and a half\num and and um it was all done by cloud\ncode. Um what was I going to say? I\nforgot. Anyway, the point was um and\nthere's another announcement related\nthat by the way uh the the people behind\ncursor built a browser in Rust. No, in\nRust. Yes, they built a browser with the\nfull rendering engine uh which is like 3\nmillion lines of code in a week and a\nhalf using an agent swarm and they go a\nlittle bit into details in how many\nagents they ran. And then people said,\n\"Yeah, you know, Firefox is like 31\nmillion lines of code.\" Uh but then we\ncan have a browser engine like like can\nyou imagine like WebKit or uh equivalent\nthat that can run the website. They say\nit works kind of works. We were\nsurprised it worked.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, there was a an AI generated HTTP\nHTML uh parser which basically took the\nHTML spec and produced a parser and I\nwas very impressed by that.\n>> Produced a regular expression you mean?\nUm, no. It looked like, hold on, let me\npick it up.\n>> It's a It's a very common like Stack\nOverflow question. You can't parse HTML\nwith regular expression. Let me repeat\nthat. You do not parse\n>> HTML. It's like a very famous Stack\nOverflow. And he repeated like 10 times.\nStop parsing HTML. I mean, this is this\nis old news. This is this is 2025 uh\nDecember. Okay. But there's this project\ncalled just HTML\nwhich completely generated by AI\nand it's basically yeah the cool thing\nabout yeah HTML 5 lib like Henry Civan\nand and friends has a whole bunch of\ntests so it passes all the tests so it's\nit's a brilliant thing because it has\nthe test framework obviously used it and\nuh\n>> it manages to to implement a whole\npassing library in like Um, I think the\nlines of code is Yeah. 3,000 lines of\ncode.\n>> Yeah. Well, this one from the cursor\nguys is three millions lines of code.\nUm, I think we're going to see this more\nand more now.\n>> People coming forward with like we built\nthis thing in a week and a half. It's\nmillions lines of code. It was a swarm\nof agents built it\n>> and\n>> it depends how well known it is, what\nthe testing suite is, I suppose. And\n>> yeah,\n>> but like for but like it's brilliant.\nFirst comment you're going to get is\nlike they're not re they're not\ninventing nothing new. It's no\ninnovation. It's just repeating what we\nhave. Like that's the common\n>> trope I guess.\n>> Yeah.\n>> But I I often when I mean I in the start\nof my career I actually worked on a web\nbrowser engine called webvm which and\nits innovation was to bring in device\nAPI so you could use you know GPS and\naccelerometer and things like this. So,\nI was working with\nbrowser engines. I was working with um\nthe W3C. I was in the mobile, I don't\nknow, task team or something. And I\nalways I always was a bit depressed\nthinking that like uh like WebKit is\nprobably the only browser engine in\ntown, but and and and the web is\nprobably doomed because of that fact.\nBut now with AI, we're not we're we're\nLike I guess we're this the lock in\nlevel has gone down right because like\n>> like I think we talked about it before\nbut like you know Jira like like oh you\ncan't implement another Jira\n>> there won't be any more SAS everyone can\nbuild their own SAS in in\n>> Exactly. It's amazing, isn't it? It's\nabsolutely amazing. I feel I feel\n>> it's a disruption.\n>> I feel liberated if anything, but u\nbut what you just said about\n>> I think I've just\nindependent. Yeah,\n>> but more specifically the rendering of\nHTML and Javas and execution of\nJavaScript and the DOM and all that,\nright? They are building um I knew like\nfor a while ago a zigg\nu based\nengine web like a browser but focused on\nLLM so to represent everything as text\nfor LLMs to browse. I I I came across it\na while ago and I thought\n>> but those sort of robots must exist.\nThey already been mean how else they're\npulling stuff off the web.\n>> Yeah. But that was like a public open\nsource effort from and apparently\nsomeone because I was interested in zig\nand then I came across like different\nframeworks in zig such as web servers\nand then I came across um somebody's\ncourse that\n>> coincidentally I used to work with that\nperson.\n>> Everyone wants to sell a course.\n>> No no no no this is this person I worked\nwith them and they they are very open\nsource minded and they built a course to\nreally you know it's fully open source.\nis not sold or anything like that but\nhe's also working uh as I was going\nthrough this course and then the profile\nI realized he was working on this\nbrowser and I thought that's really cool\nuh so he's very much working on on Zik\nand that's really cool but but back so\nthose browsers for LMS but now all not\nonly SAS but also complete foundational\ntools being rewritten and also brings us\nto the point of like Linux\n>> but that's mostly happening in Rust\nright I don't know why Zig is on the\nradar for you over Rust\nUh, bun is written in zigg. Bun is\nacquired by entropic.\n>> So,\n>> bun is the super fast. Zigg is like a\nmodern C like it even it has a a C\ncompiler that is much faster. So, you\ncan even compile um cross you can use a\nzig build system to cross-co compile um\nC libraries and into different towards\nto target different machine\narchitectures. So zig is even the zig\nbuilder is even used as a way to port um\n>> yeah go like go has that I'm pretty sure\nrust has that\n>> uh no go see go does not uh it still\nrelies you cannot like look at sql light\nyou cannot build or use sqlite with the\nseago um limitation this is actually\nlike c cross compilation so zig is\namazing there but anyway the point was\nthat teams coming forward building whole\nthings whole libraries other teams,\nother people because everyone says, \"Oh,\nyou know, LLMs, they don't produce good\ncode.\" But then Linux going forward\nsaying, \"I built this um audio\nvisualizer, uh a toy project.\" And um\nand this also is like brought up in Te's\nvideo where more and more people are\ncoming and saying like, \"I don't write\nthe code anymore.\" Um and and Taylor\nthen goes on in in in his video about\nlike why is it that senior engineers are\nmore like more used to or more\nacceptable to um to AI tools to LLM\ntools and then I saw some interesting\ncomments like yeah they're used to see\nand review other people's code like\njunior code so they know what code might\nlook like and the second thing that they\nhighlighted and if you put the document\non the screen you will\nis that um seniority is determined not\nby how much you code but by how well you\ncan orchestrate and delegate and those\nare management type of uh you know\ncapabilities. So as you are preparing\nyourself for a future of AI agents, you\nneed to move towards what they regularly\nattribute to staff engineers which are\nbetter at uh setting like delegation and\norchestration of workflows which is the\nreal differentiator between juniors or\nseniors and staff.\n>> Yeah. So I guess I I would agree with\nthat that uh\n>> observation.\nI mean at at work I just flippantly call\nit just writing things down. Like that's\nthe difference between a junior and a\nsenior. you write things down and uh\nyeah but that's a bit flippant but uh\nwhat what what is really needed is is\nabsolutely you know quality\nconcise\nuh documentation to get things done\n>> and a clear goal clear structure just\nclear thinking clear thinking is\nactually um I guess the number one\nskill to have right Because if you don't\nwrite clearly,\nyou're not going to get very far with AI\nas I feel. I mean,\n>> I disagree.\nI don't think I write very clearly. And\n>> okay, maybe maybe write clearly is not\nquite what I wanted to say. If you just\nif you just can't express yourself or\nsomething or express your ideas, it's\ngoing to be a struggle.\n>> A different angle as well. Um, so I've\nbeen doing speckit for what since around\nNovember or October and then with beats\naround November and what this has taught\nme I was not good at writing clear\nspecification documents and things like\nthat. Specit gave me a very good um\nexperience of like that's exactly what I\nneed right now. I mean I hadn't really\nhad the experience of working in\nenvironments where this was you know the\nthe common practice. So, I wasn't good\nat writing those documents, but when I\nsaw them,\n>> that's a good point.\n>> Yeah. When I saw them, I knew that\nthat's that's really good and that's\nwhat I like and and that's that was\nembedded within the prompts that\n>> So,\nso it sounds like the senior people like\nyou and I, senior seniors,\nthe the trick up a sleeve is that we\nknow what it what's good,\n>> not necessarily that we can produce\nwhat's good. In the meantime, this is\nwhat happens to my art my hyperland.\n>> Yeah, you've shown that to me before. It\ndoesn't happen to me actually. Got to\nyou got to get yourself the dual monitor\nor the GPU drivers that I need to\nupdate. I don't know. Yeah, that's Yeah,\nthat's that's interesting because yeah,\nI I take back what I said because\n>> because\nstuff that I've written and then when\nI've launched gone into plan mode and\nthen and then I've asked for for clar\nasked u claude for for clarity and uh\nwith ask question user tool. It's\nactually been an amazing experience.\n>> Exactly. Well, I agree with you that I\nthink the difference between senior and\njunior is that a senior, like you said,\nis going to write things down, maybe be\nflippant, but it's going to pause and\nplan ahead, which is like when you start\nwith cloud code, you you go into plan\nmode and you already get like a very\nfast feedback loop and you're like very\neager to jump into the code and to get\nit done.\n>> Uh, but once you go into more of spec\ndriven environment,\n>> then you really have to spend like I\ntold you at the start 80% and this is\nalso being repeated by many people\n>> some some water falling. No, I'm joking.\n>> Some some Yeah, you're right. Yeah, it\nis.\n>> You do a lot more upfront thinking about\nlike, you know, ultimately these these\nlarge language models are great at\nhallucinating, right? At at at thinking\noutside of the box. They have this\namount this massive, you know, I would\nsay library of words to choose from. And\nthey very easily pick between which\nwords, right? When you say something, I\ndon't like that word. Oh, how about\nthese other 10 words? Which one do you\nlike? They're all similar. And I was\nlike, \"Oh, yeah, that one is good.\" So,\nso they're very good at like um you\nknow, with words. Obviously, they're\nlarge language models, right? So, so\nthey're very good at that. And they are\nvery good at looking at a specification\nand then coming up with like what if\nwhat if this, what if that, what do you\ndo if the user doesn't have uh what if\nthe user doesn't have the credentials\nready? What if the the process fails\nmidway, you know? So, so it comes up in\nall of these cases. you know, you you\nset out your original, you know, goals\nthat you want to try and get and then it\nit builds like,\nyou know, the more context it built\naround the topic, the more it can, you\nknow, think about alternatives and it\nhelps you, you know, come up with these\nthings very quickly.\n>> So,\n>> and I'll give you\n>> Yeah, sorry.\n>> Yeah. I mean,\nI'm I'm just looking at the slide there\nthat you screenshotted with the\norchestration delegation clarity. I get\nI get orchestration. I think that's what\nwe've been talking about like\n>> what he he means with delegation is\nbreaking like complex problems down into\nsmall steps and then handing these off.\n>> AI does that for you.\n>> Uh maybe yeah but you need to know what\nif those are reasonable steps. You need\nto understand that this is the the path\nthat I want to go. You need to be you\nyou may also you need to still be\ncritical and think like wait a minute\nlike I've had several instances with\nLLMs that they go a certain way and I'm\nlike hold on a minute we're like we're\ngoing in a circle here like or we're\ngoing in a massive detour. Can't we just\n>> maybe I'm just I'm just being panted by\ndelegation. I guess delegation to me\nOkay, let's move on.\n>> There's a lot he he he gives a lot of\ncontext around this this this um\ndiagram, right? and and I I listened to\nit and then we should put the link in in\nour video because it's a it's a really\ngood one. Um\n>> but what I shared above that is kind of\nlike I I I read four or five things\nbefore I started work. Uh the first one\nwas uh with AI writing code is fast but\nyeah this is common that we we talked\nabout that right uh the Google team uh\nspending two years building a new I\ndon't know network routing or load\nbalancer system and then ultimately\nrebuilding it in a week well duh I mean\nit takes it takes weeks to\n>> actually I like your point in in the\nprevious podcast that like you never see\nthat cost you know captured like the\nfact that people have been thinking\nabout this for weeks if if months at\nadvance, but you you only you only see\nthe headline that it took a day to\nbuild. You don't see the fact that you\nknow all this human effort went into\nthinking and testing and coming up with\nthe idea in the first or the the details\nof the the plan in the first place or\nsomething or or all or all or all or all\nor all or all or all or all or all or\nall or all or the lessons learned\nrather. What what I I took away from\nlong time ago was if you want to be a\nsuccessful like at startup or founder or\ncreating something you must be very\ncritical of the world you must you must\nalso see like\n>> I don't like this there must be a better\nway and then come up with it like if you\nhave an inconvenience or or something\nthat bothers you and that's our role\nright once we have these we discover\nthese inconveniences and we think how\ncould we solve this differently that's\nkind of like\n>> I'm just going to write some I'm just\ngoing to write some of these things down\nOops. If I could just spell.\n>> I'll just carry on. Ignore me.\n>> Dictated. Dictated.\n>> I was just trying to\ncapture the things that I think are kind\nof working in my favor at least.\n>> Right. The next thing um was Greg\nMccluki's post. He's one of the creators\nof of uh you know within Google on on\nKubernetes. And the post started with\nthe very you know that when I started\nreading it I was like oh this is like\ncomplaining about Tailwind losing its\nbusiness and you know uh basically the\nerosion of of open source um no funnels\nno way like no new foundational\nlibraries being built the whole thing is\ncollapsing right because it was like\nopen source as a problem but his focus\nwas more like we create like things to\nwork on in our project and then people\ngenerate a massive amount of code and\nthey don't really care about the review\nprocess like is this good code or not\nand and he and and then I said like oh\nthis is complain about AI quality but\nthen he actually gave a very good\nconclusion so the at that time I think\nmost people stopped reading because all\nthe comments were like oh AI slop AI\nslop this AI slop that but the the real\ncrucial point or takeaway from his post\nwas at the bottom which is like we as\nengineers have to as leaders have to put\nin is you know teaching how we other\npeople can use the tools the AI tools\nhe's not saying don't use AI tools he's\nsaying we need to put in place the the\nthe framework for people to use the\ntools correctly so that what they\ncontribute and generate with with those\ntools is not slop but it is you know in\nalignment with our code qualities our\nverification our validation you know so\nif you are uh an open source repository\nuh maintainer put in place all of the\ntools like put in place uh speckit\nsome hooks.\n>> Exactly. Put in put in all of these\nthings that if somebody clones a repo\nand starts working on it and they open\ncloud, uh it immediately says, \"Hey, I\nsee this is um there's a couple of\nskills here that I can use to work and\ncontribute on this.\"\n>> So, so\n>> I thought that was a very good takeaway\nand half the comments in reply did not\ntotally miss that because that's you\nonly notice and know exactly what he's\ntalking about if you actually done these\nthings.\n>> Yeah. I mean, I'm so impressed with the\nDHH and Amachi because because I launch\nClaude inside inside Amachi and\nimmediately it picks up the skill.\n>> So immediately you have the AI aware\nenvironment for what you're trying to do\non your on your Linux distribution. Um I\nmean it should be lorded as a as a\npioneer in this respect, right? Because\nlike I don't\n>> and I'm doing the same thing.\n>> Okay, fine. Um maybe he's a pioneer\nbecause he has already done it. But I\nhadn't seen the the Omari skills, but I\nwas just saying the same thing. Um since\nwe made the public announcement of um\nreviving the project that was sunset by\nIBM um it's an open source project. I\njust integrated specket into it and I\nset up with a cloud skills for beats and\nI generated the first spec which is how\ndo we rename it like what\n>> what's what what what is the user story\nfor for\n>> is it the CD what con\n>> it's called CDK terrain now like CDK\nterraform uh terrain\n>> let's see if uh\n>> yeah that one well there is good so if\nyou look at the the latest pull request\nu the lot the the one that I just\nUm there is the RFC the rename.\nYeah. So so this one\nthis is all cloud code generated like\nthe purpose the user stories the\nfunction requirements\n>> the spec inside the github issue.\n>> No no no no the spec is on the branch.\nThis is just a summary of everything\nthat I committed in this particular\nthing. I ran\n>> I ran three commands uh which is I ran\nthe the specify to generate the the user\nstories spec ledger is my fork which is\nall my customization of specit cuz the\nguy who manages specit left Microsoft\nhe's now atropic he joined the labs team\nI believe\n>> oh my lord oh my lord\n>> yeah he was he was working on mcps like\nunder a lot of conferences at the end of\nthe year he wasn't doing anything on\nspecket anymore except for maybe merging\nsome like PRs. But so this is what I\nexpect like in terms of quality. And the\nfunny thing is I didn't really tell\nanyone but I shared it with some people\nand I wanted I was waiting and like oh\nis this AI slop actually maybe because\nthey didn't know they were like you are\nreally good at writing user stories and\nI'm like I didn't write any of those\nactually. I mean I spend a lot of time\nfine-tuning them and reviewing them and\nmaking sure they're aligned with what\nI'm trying to do.\n>> Where are the user stories here? Sorry.\n>> Under spec. So just above the cloud MD\non the left side. Yes.\n>> Yeah. Again go to the branch and look at\nthem. It's more logical. I mean\n>> yeah well that's faster. So user story\none like new new user bootstrap after\nit's been renamed and then you have\nacceptance scenario. Given a developer\nhas installed the CLI when they run the\ninit everything will work. You don't\nhave any dependency on the old. This is\ninteresting cuz this is one thing I have\na bone about your typical user stories\nis the acceptance scenario\num\ndoesn't\naddress the fact that some of these\nthings you know it's like\nokay this is probably just me moaning\nbut like a lot of cards that I pick up\nit's like okay uh if this new update is\nbeing done then uh you can now deploy\nthe new version of Airflow or something\nlike this, but there's no like like real\ntest other than manually\nverifying that something has been done.\nUm, and I'm wondering and just aloud\nhere,\nyou know, since I see this or something\nlike this, can like are your tests um do\nyour user story acceptance tests\nactually become tests is what I'm trying\nto say.\n>> That's that's what the whole idea of of\nKiru and AWS is, right? it's to turn\nthey put a lot of formal parsing and\nthey are forcing the LLMs within ko to\nwrite the acceptance criteria in a\nformat that they can formally parse and\ngenerate BDD uh behavioral\ndriven development right it it it\ndoesn't come back to you and say like oh\ntask done but uh you know I couldn't\nwrite I couldn't write a test for that\none or something like that or you know\nbecause that's what happens in in real\nlife is like a a developer comes back to\nme and says like, \"Yeah, I've done\nthis.\" Um, all I I have a screenshot to\nprove that it's done and I'm like,\n\"Okay.\" Um,\n>> how do I prevent regressions? No, I mean\nlike obviously I'm not working with\npeople anymore, so I don't trust\nanything the LLM says. It has to have a\ntest. Uh, the thing is it's going to\nwrite tests for everything, which is not\nalways good. Uh, but it does it does\nwrite.\n>> No trust for the AI.\n>> No, but that's one of the main things\nthat everyone is saying now, right? I\nmean our role is to to orchestrate and\ndefineation.\n>> I just I just think it's interesting in\na way just to sound out these\ndifferences\n>> at least for now. But if we go back to\nto like the narrative of Theo, which is\nultimately what I also feel because I\nnever wrote user stories this good\nbefore and I got the comment now this is\nreally good. You write really well. But\nI'm like I did write this anyway. Um but\n>> yeah going back to the\n>> Yeah.\npoint which is which he made at the end\nof it. Um because writing code is now\ntrivial, right? We can we can get\nsomeone something to do it for us. Um\nbut if you scroll down even people like\nLinuvaults who wrote the kernel and um\nyou know that they also say those people\ndon't even write code anymore, right?\nMost of the time they have an an idea\nand then they put it on the mailing list\nand someone picks it up and works on it\nand then they like it, they review it\nand they can merge it. But he said also,\nand this is exactly what I'm trying to\nsay, is you can become a good manager\nthis way because you pause, you create\nyour plans, you you you review, you do\nthat over and over and over again with\nAI agents. They're sometime going to\ndeliver what you want and they're\nsometimes going to fail miserably. And\nyou're going to learn that I had this\nstupid word in there and it tripped up\nthe AI and it started doing all this\nadditional stuff that I didn't want\nbecause of one or two words. stupid\nthings like error messages must be clear\nor that's obviously something you want.\n>> I mean, we're talking about a good\nmanager of of AI agents here because\nlike\n>> that's the future to be honest,\n>> but I'm I'm a little bit confused\nbecause, you know, I'm a I'm a I'm a\nmiddle manager as I mentioned before.\nThere's a few people that I work with.\nUm I'm a lead in a team.\nWhat does it mean for humans?\nSo, so what Theo was saying here, you\ncan become a good manager and the future\nwith AI adoption. The people that are\nthriving are the ones that, you know,\nhave learned that their time isn't best\nspent writing code. And I'm quoting Theo\nexactly because I wrote it down. Um,\nthey're they they know that their time\nisn't best spent writing code, but\nbetter spent thinking about\n>> Yeah. I mean, I'm just thinking aloud. I\nmean, I guess I got to get my colleagues\nto be managers, I suppose.\nYeah. Um\n>> they all need to come up to\nYeah. learn these skills.\n>> What's the other thing he said? Like the\nfuture depends on their ability to\nimprove around delegation and\norchestration, planning and strategic\nthinking, which is what I'm I have an an\ninterview tomorrow for like a staff\nengineer position. And um\nthese questions trip me up, you know,\nbecause every time I it's very I I use\nCH GBT. I said I have here's a JD the\njob description. Uh I gave my background\nof what I've done in the last five\nyears. So it of of course it starts\nglazing you saying yeah yeah yeah\nperfect you can do all of this. Yeah I\ndon't care trust it. Um and I said look\nwe're going to do practice interview\nright and it ask me these question and\nyou go into voice mode and it goes into\nthis very very it's it switches in\nanother mode. I'm sure I'm not making\nthis up. It go it switches in a special\ninterview mode that they built in\nChachiBT and it asks the question and\nthen it waits for your answer until you\nstop talking and then it gives you the\nfeedback. You went too deep on this.\n>> Yeah, it's amazing.\n>> You're using you're using JT advanced\nvoice mode or something.\n>> Yeah, I I used and play with it before,\nbut I I I thought you know\n>> I find it stutters back at me more than\noften.\n>> Your internet connection is pretty bad I\nthink.\n>> Oh no, no it isn't actually. Actually,\nthis this goes\n>> you're probably on like a more than\n>> on the topic of strategic thinking. I\nfor some reason I randomly watched this\nvideo yesterday and it it didn't have\nmany views and it looked like clickbait,\nbut since I was doom scrolling, I I\nwatched it anyway because it it was\ndifferent to all the I was\nwatching last night.\non on the topic of strategic thinking. I\nthink it's quite interesting because as\na as a consultant when when I when I\njoin a client, you know, they have a\nbunch of problems\nand usually since I'm in delivery and uh\nand usually since a client often doesn't\nreally have a good vision yet. I mean,\nwe we work on this problem, of course,\nbut but often I'm thrown into the the\ndeep end and uh we're just trying to\nsort out the delivery and then often\nthere's lots of tasks in the backlog and\nI just I end up basically saying yes to\na lot of these tasks. I will do them.\nI'll do them. I'll do them. And\nespecially now that I have AI on my\nback, I can do these things very very\nquickly. I can just pick up cards. And I\nguess in my in my in my my caveman mind,\nI'm thinking like, you know, my velocity\nis going to look insane. I'm going to\nlook great because I'm so much more\nproductive than um the other people on\nthis project. But it that's kind of\nstupid thinking after watching the video\nbecause because ultimately, you know, he\nwas pointing out that no one no one gets\nlike promoted or um by doing lots of\nwork. You know what I mean? Like that's\nnot how it works. You need strategic\nthinking. It's about saying it's by by\nshowing that you've prioritized some\nthings over another for a particular\nstrategic reason. Uh it's it's about\nsaying no. It's about it's about\nreaching a certain outcome. I mean, I do\ntry to reach an outcome when I'm in a\nclient project, but sometimes the the\noutcome or the customer is just opaque\nto me or um and I'm just doing the best\non the delivery front. I mean, that's\nthat's where I am in my career to be\nhonest. I'm in I'm in I'm in stone cold\ndelivery, but now but now stone cold\ndelivery is is somewhat solved by AI. I\nwant to move up in the food chain\nand I'm actually just asking myself how\ndo I get there?\n>> Yeah. So, Chachi gave those questions as\nwell in during my interview\nspecifically. How do you deal with\nshort-term priorities against long-term\ngoals? Um how do you deal with conflicts\nlike in terms of when you are um not\ncompletely agreeing with the direction\nsomething's going? So you know these\ntype of questions where I responded with\nlike examples of previous scenarios I\nhad been in and then it told me look the\nthings you did there and the way that\nyou work is clear communication setting\nresponsibility boundaries setting this\nand that. So\n>> uh so it's really focused on these um on\nthese um it's a good mock interview just\ntelling you and and also maybe it helps\nyou also clear form a better view. I\nthen practice with my family and every\ntime my son or my wife said something I\nsaid look I hear you but how about we\nare going\n>> until they got like nause annoyed by it\n>> you want to you want to drive to a\ncertain outcome and uh almost I mean\nmaybe I'm going to getting too adult by\nthe video that watch like you're almost\ngoing into politics now or something\nlike that because\n>> you're dealing politics\nBut the the the the advice I got from my\ndad who's been project like working for\nfor his whole life project manager or\ndirector and then he told me the most\nimportant is when you go for such\ninterview is because I was like I'm not\nprepared. I have all these things that I\nI I I stumble on these questions like\nall you have to do is pause and sound\nlike a reasonable human being. Make sure\nyou're well rested. Make sure you sound\nlike you uh you have logical thinking.\nNice.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And and and and and calm down just\n>> Yeah. The the let me tell you just a\nquick story like I was at I was in um a\nprivate Catholic school in South Africa\nand um there was lots of exams and I and\nsometimes I would just struggle and then\nthe uh the sort of uh the headmaster uh\nMr. a he said to me, \"Kai, did you get a\ngood night's sleep?\" And I said,\n\"Actually, no.\" I was kind of like\nthinking about this and working through\nthis. He says, \"Go to bed early,\n>> get a good rest.\" And then I I followed\nhis advice and I was like amazed how\nmuch I mean I don't know if if the\nresults were immediate but I can't\nreally remember but I was amazed how\nmuch how how less stress and how better\nthe exam went for me and I think the\nresults also reflected that and it was\njust it was just such a simple thing.\nThat's true. I mean, I have the same\nlike every time I'm stuck uh working\nlate trying to get something over uh you\nknow, done and you don't know when to\nstop. You just want to keep going and\nultimately you're too tired. You just go\nto sleep and then you spend an hour and\nwhen you wake up you wake up and you\nthink I could have done that in 5\nminutes because honestly I was just\nwrong at this point and I could have\njust figured it out way faster\n>> if I had a clear vision. If I had walked\naway a little bit and and thought about\nit. So\n>> yeah, I'm just I'm just worried that\nI've been doing things wrong for for so\nlong now because I guess I've just been\nin this crazy delivery mode where I\njust, you know, for me it's all been\nabout improving velocity, getting the CI\nworking, improving quality, build,\nbuild, build build.\n>> And AI is definitely making me reflect\non this all this stuff now.\n>> Yeah. And I think that's\nThat's why, you know, I'm doing that\ninterview more as a practice round\nbecause I'm not sure I'm going to get\nit. Although that with all the good\nadvice, maybe I'm able to surface more\nthe qualities that I I do have the um\nyou know, I have dealt with those\nsituations. But like like you said, I\nalso went like heads down harder work to\nget it done. Um which doesn't help in in\nin like a collaborative environment\nwhere we have to like communicate and\nand find out and know how we can meet\nthe targets and things like that. Right.\nSo, I don't expect to get it, but I do\nfeel like with AI, I've learned a lot\nmore about pausing, planning, and taking\non more of a higher um, you know, level\nor strategic thinking position. And I'm\ntrying to apply that in in this in this\nopen source thing that I'm doing based\non blue.\n>> I mean, like your your CDF CDK terrain\nor what was it called before? Uh,\n>> CDKF. Yeah, CDK.\n>> CDKF. Yeah. I mean, you're you're\nbecoming a credit a product owner and uh\nI mean, do you have\nI mean, hopefully you have some users\nthat you're getting some feedback from.\nAnd\n>> yeah,\n>> if that's happening, then you're you're\non a good path already. You're in a\nbetter place than I am. I mean, I\n>> don't know if you remember, I did used\nto have my own product uh webcon\nconverger.com\nand own business to go with it. I mean I\nwas I was earning money\n>> with it\n>> and uh and that was my life for a few\nyears and it was good times in a way but\nthe\nbut I guess since it was like one man\nband\n>> you could revive it now you have a\nfleet.\nYeah, I I don't think the, you know,\nthese kiosks that you see in libraries\nand things like that, I don't I mean,\nmaybe digital signage is still a thing.\n>> Um, but but the I'm not too sure the\nmarket is there for for that product. Um\n>> Mhm.\n>> I mean, but yeah, you're right. I could\nrevive it. I I should I should I need to\nbecome a product owner really. Uh just\nlike what you're trying to do. I mean or\nwhat you are doing.\nYou got Souk and you got Vincent. You\ngot\n>> It's my You got a few You got a few\npersonalities that I'm online.\n>> I didn't realize I was logged in under a\ndifferent account and I was like, \"Oh,\nwhatever. I don't care.\" I could have\ndeleted and do it again.\n>> Yeah. So, I wish you like I mean, we\nshould we should turn this podcast and\nlike how to have a successful business\na successful product owner. Um\nI I guess so this is still does this\nhave a business are you going to are you\ngoing to get people to pay for it\n>> somehow?\n>> No, absolutely not. This is open source.\n>> Oh god.\n>> How are you going to pay for the\n>> there are companies depending on this\n>> Vietnamese soups?\n>> I don't I don't know that's not on the\nprim that's okay. The first and foremost\nI do this because I want this tool. I\ndon't want it to die. I've I built terra\nconstructs because I'm tired of\nterapform modules and I don't want to\nwrite another line of terapform module\ncode in my life ever again. So well\nthat's too much. Of course if I'm look\nlooking for an opportunity and they are\non terapform modules I'm not going to\nforce them to use my library. Um I'm\njust going to keep telling them every\ntime I'm upset.\n>> Can I just relate? I had a I've been\ndebugging furiously the last two days a\nCDK issue at the client. it was the\ncircular dependency uh problem\n>> and I don't feel I would have hit that\nwith Terraform. I don't know do you have\nany opinions about circular\ndependencies?\nThere's so many companies when I come\ninto organizations that have rolled out\nTerraform without having any prior\nexperience into it and a common scenario\nis they they try to centralize um like\nthe classic thing about security for\nexample this module does all of the IM\nroles this module does all of the\nsecurity groups because this is like the\ncentral IT type of setup whereas uh\nyou're you're going vertical this\nproduct owns this security group this IM\nrole this belongs to that product it's\nlike vertical slice versus horizontal\nBut the trouble is that in this\nparticular client they've gone CDK\nacross the whole platform in like they\nhave a storage stack, a security stack,\na network stack.\n>> Yeah. So the storage stack gets a bit\nmad.\n>> So of course you're going to have\nvertical and and uh teams are going to\nown shared resources. So you must uh but\nusually the type of cycles you describe\nhappen in terapform similarly as in\ncloud formation which is you are\ncreating a security group over here and\nthen you are um you know creating the\nthing over there and then you need to\ncross references and they end up\ndepending of each other and now you have\nto deploy this first and then you have\nto apply that and then you have to\n>> I was just I guess I was just a bit\n>> I was just a little bit I thought maybe\nthe the ergonomics of the CDK developer\nexperience was not\ncuz I feel like with terraform when when\nI see dependency issues it's very clear\nbecause the way the way that this\nproblem\n>> this is not a CDK like please use the\nword AWS CDK when you talk about cloud\nform okay because\n>> because I do not use cloud form I use\nCDK for terraform and now CDK terrain\nwhere all everything you said about like\nCDK doesn't give me the clarity it's AWS\nCDK doesn't give you that\n>> yeah yeah the AWS CDK tool yeah yeah\nyou're right and okay god this is going\nto be difficult to talk about have to\nprefix everything with AWS. So the way\nthat this problem manifested itself with\nthe AWS CDK uh diff it it showed like\nall these IM changes\nand then an AWS CDK deploy\nbasically\nbailed out because of all these circular\nuh dependencies.\n>> Yeah, cloud formation can be very\npainful. Uh Terraform is going to tell\nyou that very quickly. It's going to say\nI cannot plan this because there's a\ncycle detected early. If you do it\nwithin Exactly. So, so I guess my my my\nmoan is about how diff and and and\ndeploy\n>> were like\n>> not really lining up very well. I mean,\n>> yeah,\n>> it confused a lot of people and then I\nthen as the most experienced person on\nthe project, I picked it up and I was\nlike banging my head for two days.\n>> Yeah. So, so the thing is that's exactly\nwhy I am doing what I'm doing which is I\nlove AWS CDK developer experience but I\ndo not like the things that you just\ndescribed which is problems with cloud\nform not uh you know the same\nflexibility in how I do my plan and diff\nbecause uh with cl with terapform you\nhave atlantis automation that you can\nuse you have so many tooling around it\nyou because with AWS CDK you are tied to\nthe cloud for runners of AWS and however\nthey make it available. It has pros\nbecause you don't have to deploy your\nrunners. You don't have to worry about\nthe state where you're going to store it\nbecause cloud form is taking care of all\nof it. It's all it's a full package\nsolution. It even does the full roll\nback. You can do it across regions. It's\namazing. But I do not like it. Terraform\nis is way more flexible. You control\nwhere you put your state. You control\nhow you do your runners. Do you do it in\nGitHub workflows? Do you do it with a\ndedicated instance? Do you use\nspacelift? You can choose everything you\nwant. So, so that's why I'm working on\nCDK terrain and that's why I'm working\non my library.\n>> On the topic of CDK, another thing that\nsort of blew my mind was that the the\nclient uh hadn't updated AW CDK uh\nlibrary for uh for for like two years.\nNo joke.\nand uh and that's something that I had\nto pick up\n>> and I picked it up and and when I looked\nat the change log um you know over a\nperiod of two years I was a little bit\nuh how do you say\nshocked at how many breaking changes\nthere were cuz because this is a a large\nlandscape I'm upgrading the CDK library\nacross and I'm like oh um you know\noh oh Oh\nAlmost every release there's a breaking\nchange.\n>> Terapform provider AWS from version 4 to\n5 to six have also breaking changes that\nyou want to upgrade the provider you\nhave to change the way that you write\nyour security group rules. Uh they need\nto be individual resources.\n>> I mean I don't remember this being the\nexperience in terraform. I mean I was I\nwas shocked. I was like, \"No, no, no.\nThis is not happening to me.\"\n>> Because the same the same happened.\n>> This is I mean I\n>> Is it the same in Terraform?\n>> I just told you. Yeah. Terraform\nprovider AWS version 4 versus\n>> Sorry, I thought you were talking about\num\n>> No.\n>> So this is the same this is the same\nproblem in terraform. Okay.\n>> Yeah. If you have a very old version of\nTerapform provider AWS version 4 and you\nneed to go to some feature that like\nsome for example SNS topic true is is a\nthing that was missing a property that\nwas added on the SNS service and it's\nonly available in in provider version\nv6. So you have to upgrade to version v6\nand there's quite a few breaking changes\nfrom 4 to 6. So you're going to and that\nwas even worse when you were in\nTerraform 0 0.12 to uh 0 before it was\nv1.\n>> You're right. You're right. You're\nright.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. I guess I'm just looking at\nTerraform\nin with\nit.\n>> I think Terraform surfaces these issues.\nUm again, the problem with AWS CDK that\nI will agree with and that everyone\ntells me when I talk about it, it's the\nadditional complexity. This is this\naccidental complexity versus because now\nI mean imagine this. AWS has a team\nwithin AWS that builds a service SNS or\nIM team or another one, right? They\nbuild an API. These are all not\nidentical, right? We I think we talked\nabout this. You said that's weird\nbecause Jeff Bezos\ndictates that everything needs to go\nthrough an API, but SC was every team is\nbuilding their own API around their\nservices. So some like for example if\nyou use API gateway and you want to set\nuh a different integration method\nparameter you need to JSON patch it into\nlike a you know you need to send a JSON\npatch to modify the object there's no\nindividual like sub resources like what\nyou expect with REST things like that\nright different services different APIs\nnow from those services people wrote a\nTerraform provider manually right and\nthey're going to like abstract the\nconfiguration away they're going to take\nthe way that Jason Right. And then\n>> and for the most part they've done a\ngreat job but like it's yeah it's hard.\n>> Okay. And then you have these resources\nright that are basically kind of an\nabstraction on top of those APIs. And\nnow we are building another abstraction\non top of it which is like these L2\nconstructs which are basically wrapping\nthose APIs uh wrapping those resources\nwhich are wrapping those APIs which is\nlike\n>> how many layers in between are we here?\nLike this is ridiculous right? Yeah, we\ntalked about this before, but like I I I\nwas naive or or something cuz I always\nthought that that there was some sort of\ncommon I thought it was called Mason or\nsomething. Misison or\nAmazon.\n>> Yeah, we talked to we had\n>> Yeah. and and that was and that was\nsplitting out things and you pointed to\nthat project which was I think more akin\nto that but in reality people are using\nTerraform provider and this uh CDK\nlibrary and we're basically\n>> in this world of pain in a way because\nit's man dude like this month debug\nsession with all these breaking changes\nover a two-year library jump was\nyou know not fun.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Not fun. And and and to be honest, we\nhaven't deployed it into UAT yet. It's\nonly just in dev.\n>> And and the trouble is like I feel or\nmaybe I'm taking things too personally,\nbut like I do the work. I own the I own\nthis sort of migration,\nwhich is a result really of people not\nkeeping dependencies up to date. And\nthen any any feedback about things\nbreaking is going to come back to me.\nOh, Kai, it's it's your fault. Your\nfault. Your fault. Your fault. Your\nfault. Like\n>> so DevOps is the thank most thankless\njob, right? In like platform engineer.\n>> Yeah. And then there's no tests for all\nthese like I have like I have zero\nconfidence that that the test suite\nmanaged to capture any of these breaking\nchanges.\n>> That's the problem. That's the problem\nwith how the industry has approach\napproach the platform engineering. They\nthey still clinging to config files and\nand and and saying that yeah we can't\ntest the system. Like just a few days\nago, somebody uh from Terra team posted\nMalcolm posted um the thing people don't\nunderstand is that you cannot test your\ninfrastructure the same way that you\ntest your programs. And I'm like yes you\ncan. And he's like no you can't because\nwhen you do your network in production\nand you set up your security rules or\nyour networking rules there's no way for\nyou to test that. Only in production you\ncan validate that it works the way it\nshould. And I'm like, but I agree with\nthat. But there are things that you can\ntest in the middle. Like you can test\npatterns. You can build patterns.\n>> Have you heard this project? Have you\nheard of this project? I thought you\nmight have used it. Goss.\n>> I've seen it, but I don't remember.\n>> I think it's like um\nwait, it's like YAML driven\ninfrastructure testing like\n>> Oh,\n>> test for certain things. And\n>> I used\n>> I used RSpec once which is like Ruby on\nreal uh Ruby based uh service\nspecification testing.\n>> Yeah, man. I'm a bit depressed. I think\nthe next few days with this roll out and\neverything breaking around me, I'm going\nto get so much heat.\n>> Yeah. So, so you you you touched on two\npoints because you said first um you're\ndoing all the work and you're only\ngetting contacted about breakage. nobody\nappreciate the work that you're doing.\nAnd second, we talked about there are no\ntest.\n>> Well, I don't I'm not looking for\nappreciation. I'm just looking for like\n>> No, no, look, this is this is\n>> understanding about this this I mean\nlike this 2-year AWS CDK upgrade is is\nan absolute nightmare in a in a very in\na in a very I mean we're talking like\nlike\n>> and what are you doing double digit AWS\naccounts?\n>> What are you doing to prevent this from\nhappening again?\nbloody definitely going to update the uh\nthe py project toml every freaking\nrelease.\n>> No, but like what do you do to make sure\nthat that going forward every time a new\nAWS CDK version is released, every\nsingle um piece of infrastructure that\nuses AWS CDK gets a bump?\n>> Well, that's a good question. I mean we\nwe need a process where we we we do have\nincremental changes.\n>> Yeah. So there's two parts to the\nproblem here like there's I'm focusing\nI'm a platform engineer so I'm doing the\nI'm doing the platform up uh AW CDK\nlibrary upgrade\n>> that that's that's two years in the\nmaking\n>> but this utility library is also shared\nwith all the uh the data products in\nthis platform.\n>> So so basically the CDK is going to\nupdate for two years. So all the all the\num the data products depending on this\nlibrary have now got a 2-year bump in\ntheir CDK.\nUh thankfully most data products don't\nuse the CDK but some do.\nAnd of course like like Kinesis Fire\nHose went from alpha to stable. I mean\nevery anything that has kinesis in it. I\nI'm I'm I mean yeah I'm having to work\non my own platform but like sending PRs\nto product teams saying like um oh by\nthe way uh you probably need to update\nthis code here and this code here and\nthis code here\n>> and I mean I've even been doing PRs. I\nmean the workload is insane but like\nthankfully with AI it's trivial to to\nconjure up a PR uh when but but still\nit's it's an absolute nightmare. And\nthen\n>> okay but hold on can we just discuss\nthis one second because you keep saying\nbecause of CDK this we now have to do\nthat. I tell you I worked with Terraform\nmodules for 4 years in an organization\nwith 40 plus um done at the end of it 50\ndifferent AWS accounts and it's worse.\nGuess what? You need a custom uh you\nknow library and packaging system to\nactually put in place something like\ndependabot. you at least if you're on\nCDK you have dependabot you have you\nknow procedures to manage these version\nbumps because you have semantic uh\n>> there's dependabot for terraform by the\nway\n>> yeah custom made because it's so niche\nand dumb because it doesn't have a\nproper like like like versioning like\npackage managing system\n>> it's part of GitHub uh dependabot it's\n>> yeah because they have to build so I\nunderstand you have this dependabot\nsupports the golang ecosystem supports j\num javascript ecosystem supports Java,\nNVM, Maven, Nugat. So it knows all of\nthese registries. All of these have like\nproper semantics on on like you can\ndefine I accept up to this version and\nso bumps can be controlled all of that,\nright? But\n>> not ter\n>> only if you pay for the registry from\nHashi Corp.\nOh god,\n>> you cannot like\nmaybe dependable they they have added\nthe ability to define a version\nconstraint but in the past when you use\nterafform modules you can only put it on\nan S3 bucket or you put it in git tag\nand those and it does not comp um\nsupport um a query mechanism. So only if\nyou use hashi corp registry you can\nactually define a a version constraint\nthat says I accept all major like\nanything but not pass this major\nversion. So I accept all the minor\nbumps. I accept all the patch bumps and\nthis is a paint only feature which is\nridiculous.\n>> Yeah. But like to be honest the the I\ndon't know if you work like which line\nwhich language you work with in CDK\nbecause the Python upgrade story is not\ngreat in my opinion.\n>> Yeah. No, I I use TypeScript because if\nyou want to do a cross compilation, you\ncan only do it from TypeScript to the\nother languages. So if you are a\nproducer of packages, you must use\nTypeScript. If you're a consumer, you\ncan use Python, Golang, Java. You cannot\nproduce\n>> the NodeJS gang knows how to update uh\ntheir package or JSON.\n>> They've got but like the\n>> they have like 20 different ways of\nupdating your packages.\n>> Exactly. But in the Python world, um\nyeah, there's 20 different ways to\nupdating uh well, you know,\nrequirements.ext text your py project\ntunnel\n>> in language ecosystem at least the\nthings like Google but even golang is\nkind of a horrible mess\n>> go go get minus you is uh\n>> yeah but go packaging has been solved\nyears ago\n>> try to work with private and then uh you\nneed to you private go modules\n>> yeah so it's been a while you want what\nare you going to ask me like it's broken\noh god\n>> no you have like um you have to have\nlike a way to expose the the key towards\nit um like SSH but if you have like two\ndifferent um I remember it being a huge\nmess like very painful there are\nworkarounds but it's\n>> anyway yeah I agree with you languages\nnow have good story\n>> I I agree with you that that upgrading\ndependencies is the bane of my is is a\nvery common\nproblem in in our industry and and um\nyeah, I mean I'm just picking out the\npieces here, but like in future I want\nto get the platform to to increment\ndependency updates all the time.\n>> Yes, exactly. And there's an extra bonus\ncharge of getting data products.\n>> And there's there's there's a there's a\nculture I would say in especially in the\ndata product. This is not relating to my\ncurrent client, but I've seen it in\nother places like like when the data\nwhen the data engineers get their data\nproduct working in Airflow, they're\nlike, \"Don't touch it. It's working\nnow.\"\n>> And in the end, I have no idea how to\nvalidate it.\n>> And like, you know, I hate this data\nengineer because the these guys\noften\nThey get like they get treated like\nroyalty\n>> and then they get treated like a royalty\nand the platform engineers the people\nwho make it work are like yeah that\nplatform engineer has been blocking me\nanyway. Yeah,\n>> this is such a common data versus\nplatform\n>> and then once they get it working it's\nlike don't touch it ever\nand like dude you need to update it.\nIt's running a library that's been, you\nknow, vulnerable for two years now. And\noh my god, this is my life.\n>> But maybe AI can make it better. Maybe I\ncan uh do a surgical update and uh force\npeople to um test it.\n>> There's no is there no feedback loop or\nvalidation mechanism then AI is just\ngoing to make a bigger mess. But my\nfriend also just moved from being more\nof um you know consultant um customerf\nfacing towards uh he he was he he went\nfull stack and he was very excited to go\ninto devops and and platform because he\nloved setting up the networks and having\nthe control and then he worked\n>> setting up networks. How can you love\ndoing that? That's so\n>> And then if you haven't done it before\nit's fun. Uh and then he started working\nat a few companies and then he was like\nexactly what you just told me. He was so\ngetting so frustrated and I told them\nwelcome to this side of the fence where\nthe only thing you get is complaints but\nit's not always true. I have worked in\ncompanies where they do go the extra\nmile and say look the DevOps team really\ndid like went all the way here to help\nus this not not often but sometime do\nand I did also get appreciation for like\nfixing um you know like a big outage um\nthat helped. Oh, you fixed an outage\n>> and normally under my leadership there\nwon't be outage.\n>> Yeah. So, normally you get just like\neveryone on your back. But in this case,\nthey were like, \"What do you need?\" And\nokay, I trust you and when it's done,\nthank you so much. Like it's not often,\nbut\n>> you do get those.\n>> Yeah. I feel like I've I've messed up a\nbit here, especially with the CDK\nupgrade. I should have perhaps\na\ndoesn't doesn't help that uh when we we\nwe had an initial conversation about the\nCDK upgrade uh my colleague said, \"Oh, I\nthink we need two days to do this.\" And\nthen two days later it's like um I\nbasically picked it up and I'm like, \"Oh\ngod, we should have said we need we need\nweeks for this.\" I didn't realize it was\na 2-year\ngap year.\n>> Yeah.\nYou know, the reason why I was like\nhappy, this is a funny story to lighten\nup boot a little bit. I don't know if\nit's funny. I'm I'm going to try not not\nrant, but basically my job recently with\nthe CDK terrain is to migrate all of the\narchives repositories, mirror them, and\nget them building again, right? So the\nHashi Corp when they shut it down, they\nthey closed off a whole bunch of\nrepositories. The funny thing is all of\nthat is very automated, by the way. So\nclosing them was very fast, but\nreopening them is also very fast because\nI just need to run a couple of of\nworkflows. Like they have the original\nGitHub workflow that would deprecate\nthem and I just took that one and I have\nto like reactivate them. So it's like\ndispatch and it goes and does the thing.\nNow the biggest problem is mirroring git\nrepos that are like 6 GB. So the the\nteraphone provider AWS is a 6 GB git\nrepository when you try to download it\nand when you try to mirror it. Yeah. So\nmost of them are just like 2 GB. The\nbiggest one is is\n>> so 6 GB of\n>> git this the raw git data is 6 7 GB and\nthe Golang library is 7.7 GB.\n>> I don't understand how can a git\nrepository be that big\n>> I guess because of all the automation.\nSo this also brings me to the point that\nI told everyone we need the gar garbage\ncollection mechanism because there's\njust too much data in the because you\nknow it autogenerates a lot of code\nright it takes the terapform that sounds\nway bigger than the Linux distribution I\nmean the Linux uh git repository\n>> I keep hearing weird noises anyway so\nthe point I was making that I was happy\nabout is I was trying to do this m this\nI told cloud code working with opus come\nup with the plan on how to migrate and\nfork these repositories cuz reactivating\nthem is okay once they're there just\nthey need to be there. So I need to like\nG bear clone the repo then push mirror\nto the new. So clicking fork in GitHub\nties the repositories together and any\ncontributions are not attributed\n>> until they're merged. So if you have an\narchive repository and you fork it,\nthat's not good. You need to actually\ncreate a new repo and then clone and\npush mirror the the thing. Uh and and we\nwe built a script and it was working\ngreat for all of the repos I did until I\nhit this 7 GB one and it kept failing\nover and over and over and over.\n>> Linux is about seven.\n>> Yeah. So, so, so then the thing that\nthat that um\nthat was funny because I was going to\nsell tell a funny story is that today\nafter you know I was doing this on\nTuesday or or Monday and uh I finally\ngive up and said to everyone look um the\nAWS one is going to take a bit longer.\nThere's uh a 2 GB pack limit. So even if\nman even when I was chunking it and\nsending it in bits and pieces the pieces\nwere still too big. uh they were more\nthan two gigabyte and that's the limit\nthat you can send a pack. Um and then\nfinally because I ran out of cloud code\nI asked open codes to look into it which\nis uh JPT 5.2. I was using chach 5.2\ncodeex but everyone tells me.2\nyou quick question what's the difference\nbetween 5.2 and 5.2 codeex. I don't even\nunderstand anymore. I maybe Codex is\ntrained more carefully on tools use\nbecause I have to say codeex is pretty\ngood at tools but GPT 5.2 was uh\nconstantly failing to replace strings\nand things like that. So tool use u it\nspent 10 minutes 10 minutes it was uh\nlooking at\n>> using 5.2 codeex okay yeah\n>> no codeex was fast uh but today I\nswitched to 5.2 two. Um,\n>> oh my god,\n>> no codeex. And and it spent 10 minutes.\nSo I was like literally I forgot about\nit. I asked, \"Hey, look at this error\nmessages I get when I'm trying to do a\n>> I was working on something else.\" And I\nwent back to the tab and I was like,\n\"Hold on a minute. This thing is still\nrunning.\" Like open code is still\nrunning GPT for 10 minutes. I was like,\n\"What's going on?\" And and then it\nstopped after a while. No, it wasn't.\n>> What does What does What does open code\nsay when it's, you know, like Claude\nsays combobulating?\n>> Uh, I don't remember. But but um what\nafter a while it stopped and\nwhat's funny is one of the first thing\nit says you know I could just use the\nGitHub import functionality but the\nusers asking me to fix the you know the\nchunking and so on. I was like, \"Hold on\na minute. GitHub import functionality.\nWhat are you talking about?\"\nThat's funny how they like, you know,\nhow they go there. And and I'm like,\n\"What the hell?\" I worked on this for\ntwo days with Opus and it never even,\nyou know, suggested to use the GitHub\nimport function um feature. I don't know\nwhat this is, but if it sounds\n>> I think it I think it took 10 minutes\nactually to copy 6 GB uh repository but\nwhile I was talking with you I got a\nmessage saying um your import has\ncompleted. I was like oh yeah it's been\nstuck for two days. I would have liked\nto be able to do it myself like I I set\nup a 2x large runner in the US right\nnext to I hope one of the data centers\nof GitHub so that I can get the data\nlike it's going very fast but\n>> why don't you just pull it down into\nyour own good repo? I mean,\n>> yes. Yes. Sure. Sure. Kai\n>> selfhost.\n>> Yeah. Not of course.\n>> Oh my god. Am I bleeding? God,\n>> you you\n>> scratching myself.\n>> Um,\n>> anyway, that was the\n>> You got the You managed to fork it.\n>> Yes, the provider AWS is ready and now I\njust need to build it. I'm using Depot.\nUm I'm hoping that they will sponsor the\nproject because their runners are really\nfast. Uh much cheaper.\n>> Sorry. Pone. What's that?\n>> It's um it's a GitHub runner\n>> tool.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's like Docker Hub type thing or\nsomething or\n>> No, no, no.deaf. You know how in GitHub\nactions you can run your own runners and\nsome people set up like EC2 autoscalers\nto bring up the runners\n>> and then they recently had to change the\npricing policies so you get charged for\nyour own runners.\n>> Yes. And then GitHub changed the the\nrules saying that control plane also now\nis being charged. So all of these people\ngetting like a free lunch with with\nMicrosoft you know delegating jobs for\nfree and scheduling jobs everywhere. Um\nthey are now upset because like why do\nyou change it? But I think they reverted\nsome of the thing already. Uh anyway,\ndepot and then of course a whole\nbusiness was created of people providing\nrunners for you because the the margin\nuh between running an EC2 instance and\num the cost you pay for\n>> why would you have your own runner just\nfor speed\n>> um\n>> or privacy or something.\n>> Yeah, it could be that you want to run\nthe EC the GitHub runner inside your\nnetwork. So you want to run it inside\nyour VPC of this particular account. So\nit has access to different uh private in\nlike endpoints. For example, you have a\nnet uh I server to to trigger deploy.\n>> I had those networking\nsituations.\n>> Yeah. But just use\n>> so so why are you using them just\nbecause they it's just some extra beef\n>> or why you have\n>> so the providers the the terraform\nproviders are massive and to build them\nuh you need to set the node uh memory\nlimits and you need to in some cases run\nit on more than just uh two core was it\n2 GB or 4 GB default runner from GitHub.\nSo, this one's Hashi Corp is using eight\ncores and 32 GB memory machines. So, I'm\nusing and um they're giving me a 7-day\ntrial to and and it builds the providers\nsuper fast.\n>> What what what does GitHub give you? I\nthink you we talked about this before\nlike black isn't this like blacksmith\nGitHub, right?\n>> There's blacksmith, there's runs on\nthere's there's quite a few of them that\ndo the same thing. And like I said,\nthere's a whole uh ecosystem very\nsimilar to like there's a whole\necosystem.\n>> Does GitHub charge you more money if you\nif you basically specify a bigger runner\nor something? I don't know how it works.\n>> Yeah. So to to be able to even use\nbigger runners, you have to pay $5 per\nperson per se.\n>> How come is\n>> which is ridiculous.\n>> Is is there a web page talking about the\nrunners? I can't see the\n>> So I have on my repos on my other\norganization where I have nobody else\nbut me. I actually had someone else but\nI kicked them out because I have to pay\n$5 per seat to even run a bigger runner.\nAnd then I get charged on the runner\nminutes on top of that as well. So if\nyou are like five people working on an\nopen source project, you're already\npaying $20 plus all of the billable\nminutes that you get for those large\nrunners. It's it's insanely expensive.\nWhere if I use depot.dev, dev I get much\nfaster and much cheaper um runners.\nI hope they sponsor me. I mean the the\nproject, not me, but the the open source\nproject.\n>> Yeah, I mean there there was a thing on\nHacker News yesterday about how someone\nhates GitHub with a GitHub runners,\nGitHub actions with a passion. And it it\nall comes down to for me for me my\ninterpretation is that the the iteration\nspeed is is abysmal.\nAnd\n>> what is there alternative? Are there a\nshell for that dagger?\n>> Let's go back to PHP where we can just\nmake a change and it's reflected online\nimmediately.\n>> Yeah. Let's let's put in secure FTP.\n>> Well, the what is the solution? I don't\nknow. But like but like dude that's\nanother thing I could I could whine\nabout when I um\n>> when I go to\n>> see I do light\n>> when when I go to a client basically all\nthe tests are tied up in the CI you\ncan't run them locally for some reason\n>> that's nonsense that's impossible if\nthey work on a machine that is pre that\nis configured by a script then you don't\nrun that script on your machine to make\nit work come on\n>> well the trouble is is that a lot of\nthese things are uh in isolated AWS\naccounts for network isolations\nreasons or something like that and then\nyou're effed and you can only run it in\na CI\n>> and then it is blacksmith.sh message.\nSorry, I thought this this website was\nnot the right one and then Gemini\nbrought me back here. So, so basically\nyou're stuck in this GitHub action uh CF\nguess nightmare where everything takes\nat least 2 minutes. Even even like the\nmost basic workflow in the planet takes\na minute\n>> and and it just gets worse from there.\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, let's see if this\nworks. Let's wait 30 minutes. Let's see\nif that works. So let's wait another 30\nminutes. And that's that's that's the\nproblem. The iteration speed is just is\njust anything over a minute is insane.\n>> You have the same with cloud code now.\nYou ask it to do something and you have\nto wait like two three minutes before.\n>> Yeah. I I I did this I did this uh\nkind of dumb but you you you will get\nit. So basically I put an alias where\nwhere where I go get diff uh pipe it\ninto claw to create me a a commit\nmessage\n>> because you know like when you do a get\ncommit message when you do a get commit\nI\n>> I didn't want to use my precious brain\ncells to come up with a with a commit\nlog. I just wanted claw to do it. But\nthen I started using this alias to make\nthe g commits and it's so slow and I'm\nlike oh my god\n>> so there's this one guy I don't remember\nwhere I saw it but basically you can\nhook up cloud to notify and what he does\nis when cloud goes into a thinking loop\nhe unlocks social media uh Instagram\nFacebook whatever YouTube and then the\nmoment that cloud finished thinking is\nwaiting for input it I don't remember\nwho did this but it was really funny it\nbasically sends the hook and it locks\neverything. So all of his, you know,\nYouTube, whatever, Facebook, Instagram,\nall just suddenly, you know, gets\nsuspended and he's boom back into cloud.\nI think that's a very funny thing\nbecause he had then a video showing how\nevery time he kicks it off and boom,\nhe's watching videos all over his screen\nand then 5 seconds later, boom, they all\ngo away and he's like back on cloud and\nboom, all of the videos pop up again.\n>> Oh my god. Well, this this is why people\nrun multiple instances of Claude, right?\nbecause it, you know, one's blocking or\ndoing its thing and then you want to do\nanother one and then you want to do\nanother one and then you're like\n>> I just don't have\n>> you have three panes open on um on your\n>> on Ghosty and you just and you're\nwaiting for a bell or something like\nthat.\n>> 15 more days and then I think I have\neliminated enough subscriptions that I\nthink I'm going to bump from $20 to $100\non cloud cuz I'm tired of waiting. Um,\nthey've convinced me. I I I always said\nlike I I play bat on multiple horses. I\npay them the lowest subscription on each\nand I switch between when I run out of\ntokens.\n>> Oh my god, you have your training. So So\nbasically, tell me about your your\nwaiting experience. I mean, do you have\na couple of terminals open? Like how\nmany how many sessions are you are you\nhave? I usually run them on different on\ndifferent repositories not on the same\nlike I have in this case now I'm I'm\ndoing this the the specification for for\nthe rename shoot then I'm doing the\nprovider\n>> school I forgot\n>> yes\n>> okay you got to tell me you got to tell\nme about your uh how many agents you're\nrunning how many agents\n>> okay see you Vincent good chat hopefully\neveryone enjoyed that comments below\n>> see you bye",

It's 7:22 here in the UK\n[0:03] and you're listening to the AI\n[0:06] infrastructure podcast.\n[0:09] Vincent should be joining me soon from\n[0:11] Vietnam and we chat about infrastructure\n[0:15] because we're both infrastructure\n[0:17] engineers and we both love AI. So, we\n[0:21] just talk about AI too and what's\n[0:23] happening.\n[0:25] To get hold of us, uh, my email is\n[0:28] henry.fe.\n[0:30] I'm on uh\n[0:33] x.com kaihendry.\n[0:36] The website for the podcast is\n[0:38] debase.com/mpodcast.\n[0:41] d a b- s.com/mpodcast.\n[0:46] Please like which comment\n[0:49] otherwise\n[0:51] please do enjoy the conversation.\n[0:57] >> How are you? Can you hear me\n[0:58] >> finally?\n[1:00] >> Yeah.\n[1:00] >> Sorry. How long have you been waiting?\n[1:02] >> Oh, just a couple minutes. Just waking\n[1:05] up slowly.\n[1:06] >> 22. Yeah, you're earlier than usual\n[1:08] right now. You were waiting 5 minutes.\n[1:11] >> Um,\n[1:12] >> do you have time to look at all the\n[1:13] things I added into the document?\n[1:19] >> Yeah,\n[1:22] >> I was just uh waking up study and wasn't\n[1:24] HD.\n[1:26] Okay, let's have a look at the document.\n[1:32] Whoa,\n[1:34] there we have some. Can I share it on\n[1:36] the screen?\n[1:37] >> Sure.\n[1:40] >> Uh,\n[1:43] I see Theo's beautiful face.\n[1:46] >> Yeah, I guess if we're going to keep\n[1:47] quoting him, we should give him some\n[1:49] credit, right?\n[1:51] >> The fact is I I was like this morning\n[1:53] when I woke up. Sorry.\n[1:55] >> We're like the number one Theo fans.\n[1:57] It's like we talk about it.\n[1:58] >> Yeah, we're we're now doing what is this\n[2:01] format where we just watch a video and\n[2:03] react to it.\n[2:04] >> Yeah, we should react to Theo videos.\n[2:07] >> I picked up a couple of things that I\n[2:09] thought are so true. Uh what he said\n[2:12] that I've I feel the same way. Um and\n[2:15] then Primogen had me laughing out loud\n[2:18] quite a few times related to the\n[2:21] entropic move of blocking third party\n[2:23] access. to their um you know\n[2:26] subscription plans which was also very\n[2:28] funny.\n[2:30] >> Yeah. Like on the on the news front I\n[2:32] guess\n[2:34] um\n[2:37] I guess I've been I've been watching\n[2:39] that Jeffrey Huntley. Oh no, I I can't\n[2:42] remember his name. The guy the guy that\n[2:44] invented Ralph which\n[2:47] >> is it the human layers the No, that's a\n[2:50] different dude. Okay.\n[2:51] >> No. Um, yeah. If I look at my Oh, no.\n[2:55] I'm sure I want to show my my history.\n[2:57] It's probably quite dark.\n[3:00] It's very dark. Oh. Oh my god. Warren's\n[3:02] abs. Um, this guy.\n[3:05] >> Yeah. Jeffrey Huntley. He he he's he's\n[3:08] the the guy behind Ralph and he uh has\n[3:13] these kind of weird videos where he\n[3:15] talks about\n[3:17] Ralph and what you need to know about\n[3:19] agents, but he doesn't really ever get\n[3:20] to the point or into the details of\n[3:22] anything. It's kind of weird.\n[3:24] >> He's using Starship on his terminal.\n[3:26] >> Oh yeah, Starship. I've stopped using\n[3:28] Starship, actually. Uh\n[3:31] um but the thing that bothers me about\n[3:33] Ralph is that I I don't quite understand\n[3:35] how it doesn't really give you a\n[3:37] framework for generating the tasks. So,\n[3:40] >> right. Yeah, I know.\n[3:41] >> So, basically you're you're back at\n[3:43] specket looking back at specket or um\n[3:47] >> or I guess you could just use plan to do\n[3:49] it, but whatever.\n[3:51] >> When I when we talked about it, I wasn't\n[3:53] very clear because I mentioned it's just\n[3:54] a loop and you just ask the agent to\n[3:56] like find more work and continue. But\n[3:58] one of the biggest uh differences is in\n[4:01] in a traditional way that you use AI and\n[4:04] you know with the planning tool and the\n[4:06] to-do you create a couple of sequential\n[4:09] tasks and you complete them one by one.\n[4:12] But with Ralph, you delegate that uh\n[4:14] task generation. You don't tell it the\n[4:16] order or maybe you um the whole idea is\n[4:21] that you're able to insert tasks in the\n[4:23] middle. Like it's another pre um\n[4:26] predefined sequence of steps. And that's\n[4:28] something that we didn't cover. Like I\n[4:30] saw a video at that time that that went\n[4:32] into detail about like what why Ralph\n[4:34] Wigum is so good. Um because it um it\n[4:39] fetches work. But but we already do that\n[4:41] with with Beats, right? And Gasttown is\n[4:43] basically doing like Ralph but at the\n[4:45] parallel level.\n[4:46] >> Yeah. It's funny how like I mean inside\n[4:51] my consultancy company which which I\n[4:54] won't name but I feel like you know they\n[4:58] talk about problems and I think like gez\n[4:59] just use beads just use beads and you\n[5:02] this problem would be solved.\n[5:04] >> Anyway,\n[5:04] >> persistent man.\n[5:06] >> So um yeah where do you want to start?\n[5:09] Do you want to start at the bottom here?\n[5:11] >> Well, maybe you need to go up a bit\n[5:13] because if so, the first thing uh AI\n[5:17] handles coding humans think. Um, one of\n[5:20] the things that also this week was very,\n[5:23] you know, interesting in the in the\n[5:25] internet reaction. Of course, cloud uh\n[5:29] what is it? co- code or co-work being\n[5:32] announced and and and basically the team\n[5:34] Boris again saying we built in a week\n[5:37] and a half using cloud code mostly um\n[5:39] bring cloud code workflows. Yeah, of\n[5:42] course we built it in a week and a half\n[5:45] um and and um it was all done by cloud\n[5:49] code. Um what was I going to say? I\n[5:51] forgot. Anyway, the point was um and\n[5:55] there's another announcement related\n[5:56] that by the way uh the the people behind\n[5:59] cursor built a browser in Rust. No, in\n[6:02] Rust. Yes, they built a browser with the\n[6:04] full rendering engine uh which is like 3\n[6:06] million lines of code in a week and a\n[6:08] half using an agent swarm and they go a\n[6:11] little bit into details in how many\n[6:12] agents they ran. And then people said,\n[6:14] \"Yeah, you know, Firefox is like 31\n[6:15] million lines of code.\" Uh but then we\n[6:18] can have a browser engine like like can\n[6:20] you imagine like WebKit or uh equivalent\n[6:24] that that can run the website. They say\n[6:25] it works kind of works. We were\n[6:28] surprised it worked.\n[6:29] >> Yeah.\n[6:29] >> Oh, there was a an AI generated HTTP\n[6:32] HTML uh parser which basically took the\n[6:37] HTML spec and produced a parser and I\n[6:39] was very impressed by that.\n[6:41] >> Produced a regular expression you mean?\n[6:44] Um, no. It looked like, hold on, let me\n[6:47] pick it up.\n[6:47] >> It's a It's a very common like Stack\n[6:49] Overflow question. You can't parse HTML\n[6:52] with regular expression. Let me repeat\n[6:54] that. You do not parse\n[6:57] >> HTML. It's like a very famous Stack\n[6:58] Overflow. And he repeated like 10 times.\n[7:00] Stop parsing HTML. I mean, this is this\n[7:03] is old news. This is this is 2025 uh\n[7:06] December. Okay. But there's this project\n[7:08] called just HTML\n[7:10] which completely generated by AI\n[7:13] and it's basically yeah the cool thing\n[7:17] about yeah HTML 5 lib like Henry Civan\n[7:19] and and friends has a whole bunch of\n[7:22] tests so it passes all the tests so it's\n[7:24] it's a brilliant thing because it has\n[7:26] the test framework obviously used it and\n[7:30] uh\n[7:31] >> it manages to to implement a whole\n[7:34] passing library in like Um, I think the\n[7:38] lines of code is Yeah. 3,000 lines of\n[7:40] code.\n[7:42] >> Yeah. Well, this one from the cursor\n[7:44] guys is three millions lines of code.\n[7:46] Um, I think we're going to see this more\n[7:48] and more now.\n[7:49] >> People coming forward with like we built\n[7:50] this thing in a week and a half. It's\n[7:52] millions lines of code. It was a swarm\n[7:55] of agents built it\n[7:56] >> and\n[7:57] >> it depends how well known it is, what\n[7:59] the testing suite is, I suppose. And\n[8:02] >> yeah,\n[8:02] >> but like for but like it's brilliant.\n[8:04] First comment you're going to get is\n[8:06] like they're not re they're not\n[8:07] inventing nothing new. It's no\n[8:09] innovation. It's just repeating what we\n[8:10] have. Like that's the common\n[8:13] >> trope I guess.\n[8:14] >> Yeah.\n[8:16] >> But I I often when I mean I in the start\n[8:19] of my career I actually worked on a web\n[8:21] browser engine called webvm which and\n[8:24] its innovation was to bring in device\n[8:26] API so you could use you know GPS and\n[8:28] accelerometer and things like this. So,\n[8:30] I was working with\n[8:33] browser engines. I was working with um\n[8:35] the W3C. I was in the mobile, I don't\n[8:39] know, task team or something. And I\n[8:42] always I always was a bit depressed\n[8:43] thinking that like uh like WebKit is\n[8:47] probably the only browser engine in\n[8:50] town, but and and and the web is\n[8:52] probably doomed because of that fact.\n[8:55] But now with AI, we're not we're we're\n[9:00] Like I guess we're this the lock in\n[9:03] level has gone down right because like\n[9:05] >> like I think we talked about it before\n[9:07] but like you know Jira like like oh you\n[9:10] can't implement another Jira\n[9:12] >> there won't be any more SAS everyone can\n[9:14] build their own SAS in in\n[9:15] >> Exactly. It's amazing, isn't it? It's\n[9:18] absolutely amazing. I feel I feel\n[9:20] >> it's a disruption.\n[9:21] >> I feel liberated if anything, but u\n[9:25] but what you just said about\n[9:26] >> I think I've just\n[9:28] independent. Yeah,\n[9:29] >> but more specifically the rendering of\n[9:32] HTML and Javas and execution of\n[9:33] JavaScript and the DOM and all that,\n[9:35] right? They are building um I knew like\n[9:37] for a while ago a zigg\n[9:41] u based\n[9:43] engine web like a browser but focused on\n[9:46] LLM so to represent everything as text\n[9:48] for LLMs to browse. I I I came across it\n[9:51] a while ago and I thought\n[9:52] >> but those sort of robots must exist.\n[9:54] They already been mean how else they're\n[9:55] pulling stuff off the web.\n[9:58] >> Yeah. But that was like a public open\n[10:00] source effort from and apparently\n[10:02] someone because I was interested in zig\n[10:04] and then I came across like different\n[10:06] frameworks in zig such as web servers\n[10:08] and then I came across um somebody's\n[10:11] course that\n[10:12] >> coincidentally I used to work with that\n[10:14] person.\n[10:15] >> Everyone wants to sell a course.\n[10:17] >> No no no no this is this person I worked\n[10:19] with them and they they are very open\n[10:22] source minded and they built a course to\n[10:25] really you know it's fully open source.\n[10:27] is not sold or anything like that but\n[10:28] he's also working uh as I was going\n[10:30] through this course and then the profile\n[10:33] I realized he was working on this\n[10:34] browser and I thought that's really cool\n[10:36] uh so he's very much working on on Zik\n[10:38] and that's really cool but but back so\n[10:40] those browsers for LMS but now all not\n[10:43] only SAS but also complete foundational\n[10:46] tools being rewritten and also brings us\n[10:48] to the point of like Linux\n[10:49] >> but that's mostly happening in Rust\n[10:51] right I don't know why Zig is on the\n[10:54] radar for you over Rust\n[10:57] Uh, bun is written in zigg. Bun is\n[11:00] acquired by entropic.\n[11:02] >> So,\n[11:02] >> bun is the super fast. Zigg is like a\n[11:05] modern C like it even it has a a C\n[11:09] compiler that is much faster. So, you\n[11:11] can even compile um cross you can use a\n[11:14] zig build system to cross-co compile um\n[11:17] C libraries and into different towards\n[11:20] to target different machine\n[11:21] architectures. So zig is even the zig\n[11:24] builder is even used as a way to port um\n[11:28] >> yeah go like go has that I'm pretty sure\n[11:32] rust has that\n[11:33] >> uh no go see go does not uh it still\n[11:36] relies you cannot like look at sql light\n[11:39] you cannot build or use sqlite with the\n[11:41] seago um limitation this is actually\n[11:44] like c cross compilation so zig is\n[11:46] amazing there but anyway the point was\n[11:48] that teams coming forward building whole\n[11:50] things whole libraries other teams,\n[11:53] other people because everyone says, \"Oh,\n[11:55] you know, LLMs, they don't produce good\n[11:57] code.\" But then Linux going forward\n[11:59] saying, \"I built this um audio\n[12:01] visualizer, uh a toy project.\" And um\n[12:04] and this also is like brought up in Te's\n[12:06] video where more and more people are\n[12:08] coming and saying like, \"I don't write\n[12:11] the code anymore.\" Um and and Taylor\n[12:14] then goes on in in in his video about\n[12:16] like why is it that senior engineers are\n[12:22] more like more used to or more\n[12:24] acceptable to um to AI tools to LLM\n[12:28] tools and then I saw some interesting\n[12:30] comments like yeah they're used to see\n[12:32] and review other people's code like\n[12:33] junior code so they know what code might\n[12:36] look like and the second thing that they\n[12:38] highlighted and if you put the document\n[12:40] on the screen you will\n[12:41] is that um seniority is determined not\n[12:45] by how much you code but by how well you\n[12:48] can orchestrate and delegate and those\n[12:50] are management type of uh you know\n[12:53] capabilities. So as you are preparing\n[12:55] yourself for a future of AI agents, you\n[12:59] need to move towards what they regularly\n[13:01] attribute to staff engineers which are\n[13:04] better at uh setting like delegation and\n[13:07] orchestration of workflows which is the\n[13:09] real differentiator between juniors or\n[13:12] seniors and staff.\n[13:13] >> Yeah. So I guess I I would agree with\n[13:16] that that uh\n[13:18] >> observation.\n[13:20] I mean at at work I just flippantly call\n[13:23] it just writing things down. Like that's\n[13:27] the difference between a junior and a\n[13:28] senior. you write things down and uh\n[13:33] yeah but that's a bit flippant but uh\n[13:36] what what what is really needed is is\n[13:38] absolutely you know quality\n[13:43] concise\n[13:45] uh documentation to get things done\n[13:48] >> and a clear goal clear structure just\n[13:51] clear thinking clear thinking is\n[13:53] actually um I guess the number one\n[13:57] skill to have right Because if you don't\n[14:00] write clearly,\n[14:02] you're not going to get very far with AI\n[14:04] as I feel. I mean,\n[14:05] >> I disagree.\n[14:07] I don't think I write very clearly. And\n[14:09] >> okay, maybe maybe write clearly is not\n[14:12] quite what I wanted to say. If you just\n[14:14] if you just can't express yourself or\n[14:17] something or express your ideas, it's\n[14:19] going to be a struggle.\n[14:21] >> A different angle as well. Um, so I've\n[14:24] been doing speckit for what since around\n[14:27] November or October and then with beats\n[14:30] around November and what this has taught\n[14:34] me I was not good at writing clear\n[14:37] specification documents and things like\n[14:38] that. Specit gave me a very good um\n[14:42] experience of like that's exactly what I\n[14:44] need right now. I mean I hadn't really\n[14:46] had the experience of working in\n[14:47] environments where this was you know the\n[14:49] the common practice. So, I wasn't good\n[14:51] at writing those documents, but when I\n[14:53] saw them,\n[14:54] >> that's a good point.\n[14:55] >> Yeah. When I saw them, I knew that\n[14:56] that's that's really good and that's\n[14:58] what I like and and that's that was\n[15:00] embedded within the prompts that\n[15:02] >> So,\n[15:04] so it sounds like the senior people like\n[15:06] you and I, senior seniors,\n[15:08] the the trick up a sleeve is that we\n[15:11] know what it what's good,\n[15:14] >> not necessarily that we can produce\n[15:15] what's good. In the meantime, this is\n[15:18] what happens to my art my hyperland.\n[15:22] >> Yeah, you've shown that to me before. It\n[15:24] doesn't happen to me actually. Got to\n[15:26] you got to get yourself the dual monitor\n[15:28] or the GPU drivers that I need to\n[15:30] update. I don't know. Yeah, that's Yeah,\n[15:32] that's that's interesting because yeah,\n[15:34] I I take back what I said because\n[15:37] >> because\n[15:38] stuff that I've written and then when\n[15:40] I've launched gone into plan mode and\n[15:42] then and then I've asked for for clar\n[15:46] asked u claude for for clarity and uh\n[15:51] with ask question user tool. It's\n[15:53] actually been an amazing experience.\n[15:56] >> Exactly. Well, I agree with you that I\n[15:58] think the difference between senior and\n[16:00] junior is that a senior, like you said,\n[16:02] is going to write things down, maybe be\n[16:03] flippant, but it's going to pause and\n[16:05] plan ahead, which is like when you start\n[16:07] with cloud code, you you go into plan\n[16:09] mode and you already get like a very\n[16:10] fast feedback loop and you're like very\n[16:12] eager to jump into the code and to get\n[16:13] it done.\n[16:14] >> Uh, but once you go into more of spec\n[16:17] driven environment,\n[16:18] >> then you really have to spend like I\n[16:21] told you at the start 80% and this is\n[16:23] also being repeated by many people\n[16:25] >> some some water falling. No, I'm joking.\n[16:28] >> Some some Yeah, you're right. Yeah, it\n[16:30] is.\n[16:30] >> You do a lot more upfront thinking about\n[16:32] like, you know, ultimately these these\n[16:35] large language models are great at\n[16:37] hallucinating, right? At at at thinking\n[16:40] outside of the box. They have this\n[16:42] amount this massive, you know, I would\n[16:45] say library of words to choose from. And\n[16:47] they very easily pick between which\n[16:49] words, right? When you say something, I\n[16:50] don't like that word. Oh, how about\n[16:52] these other 10 words? Which one do you\n[16:53] like? They're all similar. And I was\n[16:55] like, \"Oh, yeah, that one is good.\" So,\n[16:57] so they're very good at like um you\n[16:59] know, with words. Obviously, they're\n[17:00] large language models, right? So, so\n[17:03] they're very good at that. And they are\n[17:06] very good at looking at a specification\n[17:08] and then coming up with like what if\n[17:10] what if this, what if that, what do you\n[17:12] do if the user doesn't have uh what if\n[17:14] the user doesn't have the credentials\n[17:16] ready? What if the the process fails\n[17:18] midway, you know? So, so it comes up in\n[17:20] all of these cases. you know, you you\n[17:22] set out your original, you know, goals\n[17:24] that you want to try and get and then it\n[17:25] it builds like,\n[17:28] you know, the more context it built\n[17:29] around the topic, the more it can, you\n[17:31] know, think about alternatives and it\n[17:33] helps you, you know, come up with these\n[17:35] things very quickly.\n[17:37] >> So,\n[17:37] >> and I'll give you\n[17:38] >> Yeah, sorry.\n[17:39] >> Yeah. I mean,\n[17:43] I'm I'm just looking at the slide there\n[17:45] that you screenshotted with the\n[17:46] orchestration delegation clarity. I get\n[17:49] I get orchestration. I think that's what\n[17:51] we've been talking about like\n[17:56] >> what he he means with delegation is\n[17:57] breaking like complex problems down into\n[18:00] small steps and then handing these off.\n[18:02] >> AI does that for you.\n[18:06] >> Uh maybe yeah but you need to know what\n[18:09] if those are reasonable steps. You need\n[18:11] to understand that this is the the path\n[18:13] that I want to go. You need to be you\n[18:16] you may also you need to still be\n[18:18] critical and think like wait a minute\n[18:20] like I've had several instances with\n[18:22] LLMs that they go a certain way and I'm\n[18:24] like hold on a minute we're like we're\n[18:25] going in a circle here like or we're\n[18:27] going in a massive detour. Can't we just\n[18:29] >> maybe I'm just I'm just being panted by\n[18:31] delegation. I guess delegation to me\n[18:35] Okay, let's move on.\n[18:36] >> There's a lot he he he gives a lot of\n[18:38] context around this this this um\n[18:40] diagram, right? and and I I listened to\n[18:43] it and then we should put the link in in\n[18:45] our video because it's a it's a really\n[18:47] good one. Um\n[18:49] >> but what I shared above that is kind of\n[18:52] like I I I read four or five things\n[18:54] before I started work. Uh the first one\n[18:57] was uh with AI writing code is fast but\n[19:00] yeah this is common that we we talked\n[19:03] about that right uh the Google team uh\n[19:05] spending two years building a new I\n[19:07] don't know network routing or load\n[19:09] balancer system and then ultimately\n[19:11] rebuilding it in a week well duh I mean\n[19:13] it takes it takes weeks to\n[19:15] >> actually I like your point in in the\n[19:18] previous podcast that like you never see\n[19:20] that cost you know captured like the\n[19:22] fact that people have been thinking\n[19:24] about this for weeks if if months at\n[19:28] advance, but you you only you only see\n[19:30] the headline that it took a day to\n[19:32] build. You don't see the fact that you\n[19:35] know all this human effort went into\n[19:37] thinking and testing and coming up with\n[19:39] the idea in the first or the the details\n[19:43] of the the plan in the first place or\n[19:44] something or or all or all or all or all\n[19:45] or all or all or all or all or all or\n[19:45] all or all or the lessons learned\n[19:46] rather. What what I I took away from\n[19:49] long time ago was if you want to be a\n[19:51] successful like at startup or founder or\n[19:54] creating something you must be very\n[19:55] critical of the world you must you must\n[19:57] also see like\n[19:59] >> I don't like this there must be a better\n[20:01] way and then come up with it like if you\n[20:03] have an inconvenience or or something\n[20:05] that bothers you and that's our role\n[20:06] right once we have these we discover\n[20:08] these inconveniences and we think how\n[20:10] could we solve this differently that's\n[20:12] kind of like\n[20:12] >> I'm just going to write some I'm just\n[20:14] going to write some of these things down\n[20:17] Oops. If I could just spell.\n[20:20] >> I'll just carry on. Ignore me.\n[20:22] >> Dictated. Dictated.\n[20:24] >> I was just trying to\n[20:26] capture the things that I think are kind\n[20:30] of working in my favor at least.\n[20:33] >> Right. The next thing um was Greg\n[20:36] Mccluki's post. He's one of the creators\n[20:39] of of uh you know within Google on on\n[20:41] Kubernetes. And the post started with\n[20:44] the very you know that when I started\n[20:46] reading it I was like oh this is like\n[20:48] complaining about Tailwind losing its\n[20:50] business and you know uh basically the\n[20:53] erosion of of open source um no funnels\n[20:58] no way like no new foundational\n[21:00] libraries being built the whole thing is\n[21:02] collapsing right because it was like\n[21:03] open source as a problem but his focus\n[21:05] was more like we create like things to\n[21:10] work on in our project and then people\n[21:13] generate a massive amount of code and\n[21:15] they don't really care about the review\n[21:18] process like is this good code or not\n[21:20] and and he and and then I said like oh\n[21:22] this is complain about AI quality but\n[21:24] then he actually gave a very good\n[21:25] conclusion so the at that time I think\n[21:27] most people stopped reading because all\n[21:28] the comments were like oh AI slop AI\n[21:30] slop this AI slop that but the the real\n[21:33] crucial point or takeaway from his post\n[21:35] was at the bottom which is like we as\n[21:37] engineers have to as leaders have to put\n[21:41] in is you know teaching how we other\n[21:44] people can use the tools the AI tools\n[21:46] he's not saying don't use AI tools he's\n[21:48] saying we need to put in place the the\n[21:50] the framework for people to use the\n[21:52] tools correctly so that what they\n[21:53] contribute and generate with with those\n[21:55] tools is not slop but it is you know in\n[21:57] alignment with our code qualities our\n[21:59] verification our validation you know so\n[22:02] if you are uh an open source repository\n[22:05] uh maintainer put in place all of the\n[22:07] tools like put in place uh speckit\n[22:11] some hooks.\n[22:13] >> Exactly. Put in put in all of these\n[22:15] things that if somebody clones a repo\n[22:17] and starts working on it and they open\n[22:18] cloud, uh it immediately says, \"Hey, I\n[22:21] see this is um there's a couple of\n[22:22] skills here that I can use to work and\n[22:24] contribute on this.\"\n[22:25] >> So, so\n[22:27] >> I thought that was a very good takeaway\n[22:28] and half the comments in reply did not\n[22:30] totally miss that because that's you\n[22:33] only notice and know exactly what he's\n[22:35] talking about if you actually done these\n[22:36] things.\n[22:37] >> Yeah. I mean, I'm so impressed with the\n[22:39] DHH and Amachi because because I launch\n[22:42] Claude inside inside Amachi and\n[22:45] immediately it picks up the skill.\n[22:47] >> So immediately you have the AI aware\n[22:49] environment for what you're trying to do\n[22:52] on your on your Linux distribution. Um I\n[22:55] mean it should be lorded as a as a\n[22:58] pioneer in this respect, right? Because\n[23:01] like I don't\n[23:01] >> and I'm doing the same thing.\n[23:04] >> Okay, fine. Um maybe he's a pioneer\n[23:06] because he has already done it. But I\n[23:07] hadn't seen the the Omari skills, but I\n[23:09] was just saying the same thing. Um since\n[23:12] we made the public announcement of um\n[23:14] reviving the project that was sunset by\n[23:16] IBM um it's an open source project. I\n[23:20] just integrated specket into it and I\n[23:22] set up with a cloud skills for beats and\n[23:25] I generated the first spec which is how\n[23:27] do we rename it like what\n[23:29] >> what's what what what is the user story\n[23:30] for for\n[23:31] >> is it the CD what con\n[23:33] >> it's called CDK terrain now like CDK\n[23:36] terraform uh terrain\n[23:38] >> let's see if uh\n[23:41] >> yeah that one well there is good so if\n[23:45] you look at the the latest pull request\n[23:47] u the lot the the one that I just\n[23:50] Um there is the RFC the rename.\n[23:54] Yeah. So so this one\n[23:58] this is all cloud code generated like\n[24:00] the purpose the user stories the\n[24:01] function requirements\n[24:02] >> the spec inside the github issue.\n[24:06] >> No no no no the spec is on the branch.\n[24:08] This is just a summary of everything\n[24:09] that I committed in this particular\n[24:11] thing. I ran\n[24:12] >> I ran three commands uh which is I ran\n[24:15] the the specify to generate the the user\n[24:18] stories spec ledger is my fork which is\n[24:20] all my customization of specit cuz the\n[24:23] guy who manages specit left Microsoft\n[24:25] he's now atropic he joined the labs team\n[24:28] I believe\n[24:29] >> oh my lord oh my lord\n[24:32] >> yeah he was he was working on mcps like\n[24:35] under a lot of conferences at the end of\n[24:37] the year he wasn't doing anything on\n[24:38] specket anymore except for maybe merging\n[24:40] some like PRs. But so this is what I\n[24:43] expect like in terms of quality. And the\n[24:46] funny thing is I didn't really tell\n[24:48] anyone but I shared it with some people\n[24:49] and I wanted I was waiting and like oh\n[24:51] is this AI slop actually maybe because\n[24:54] they didn't know they were like you are\n[24:56] really good at writing user stories and\n[24:59] I'm like I didn't write any of those\n[25:02] actually. I mean I spend a lot of time\n[25:04] fine-tuning them and reviewing them and\n[25:06] making sure they're aligned with what\n[25:07] I'm trying to do.\n[25:08] >> Where are the user stories here? Sorry.\n[25:10] >> Under spec. So just above the cloud MD\n[25:12] on the left side. Yes.\n[25:14] >> Yeah. Again go to the branch and look at\n[25:16] them. It's more logical. I mean\n[25:20] >> yeah well that's faster. So user story\n[25:24] one like new new user bootstrap after\n[25:26] it's been renamed and then you have\n[25:28] acceptance scenario. Given a developer\n[25:29] has installed the CLI when they run the\n[25:32] init everything will work. You don't\n[25:33] have any dependency on the old. This is\n[25:35] interesting cuz this is one thing I have\n[25:37] a bone about your typical user stories\n[25:39] is the acceptance scenario\n[25:44] um\n[25:46] doesn't\n[25:49] address the fact that some of these\n[25:50] things you know it's like\n[25:54] okay this is probably just me moaning\n[25:56] but like a lot of cards that I pick up\n[25:58] it's like okay uh if this new update is\n[26:02] being done then uh you can now deploy\n[26:05] the new version of Airflow or something\n[26:07] like this, but there's no like like real\n[26:11] test other than manually\n[26:15] verifying that something has been done.\n[26:18] Um, and I'm wondering and just aloud\n[26:21] here,\n[26:24] you know, since I see this or something\n[26:26] like this, can like are your tests um do\n[26:31] your user story acceptance tests\n[26:33] actually become tests is what I'm trying\n[26:35] to say.\n[26:36] >> That's that's what the whole idea of of\n[26:38] Kiru and AWS is, right? it's to turn\n[26:41] they put a lot of formal parsing and\n[26:43] they are forcing the LLMs within ko to\n[26:48] write the acceptance criteria in a\n[26:50] format that they can formally parse and\n[26:52] generate BDD uh behavioral\n[26:55] driven development right it it it\n[26:58] doesn't come back to you and say like oh\n[27:00] task done but uh you know I couldn't\n[27:01] write I couldn't write a test for that\n[27:03] one or something like that or you know\n[27:06] because that's what happens in in real\n[27:08] life is like a a developer comes back to\n[27:12] me and says like, \"Yeah, I've done\n[27:13] this.\" Um, all I I have a screenshot to\n[27:16] prove that it's done and I'm like,\n[27:18] \"Okay.\" Um,\n[27:19] >> how do I prevent regressions? No, I mean\n[27:21] like obviously I'm not working with\n[27:22] people anymore, so I don't trust\n[27:24] anything the LLM says. It has to have a\n[27:26] test. Uh, the thing is it's going to\n[27:28] write tests for everything, which is not\n[27:29] always good. Uh, but it does it does\n[27:31] write.\n[27:32] >> No trust for the AI.\n[27:34] >> No, but that's one of the main things\n[27:36] that everyone is saying now, right? I\n[27:38] mean our role is to to orchestrate and\n[27:42] defineation.\n[27:43] >> I just I just think it's interesting in\n[27:44] a way just to sound out these\n[27:48] differences\n[27:48] >> at least for now. But if we go back to\n[27:50] to like the narrative of Theo, which is\n[27:53] ultimately what I also feel because I\n[27:55] never wrote user stories this good\n[27:57] before and I got the comment now this is\n[27:59] really good. You write really well. But\n[28:01] I'm like I did write this anyway. Um but\n[28:04] >> yeah going back to the\n[28:06] >> Yeah.\n[28:08] point which is which he made at the end\n[28:10] of it. Um because writing code is now\n[28:14] trivial, right? We can we can get\n[28:15] someone something to do it for us. Um\n[28:18] but if you scroll down even people like\n[28:20] Linuvaults who wrote the kernel and um\n[28:23] you know that they also say those people\n[28:25] don't even write code anymore, right?\n[28:27] Most of the time they have an an idea\n[28:29] and then they put it on the mailing list\n[28:30] and someone picks it up and works on it\n[28:32] and then they like it, they review it\n[28:34] and they can merge it. But he said also,\n[28:37] and this is exactly what I'm trying to\n[28:39] say, is you can become a good manager\n[28:42] this way because you pause, you create\n[28:44] your plans, you you you review, you do\n[28:46] that over and over and over again with\n[28:48] AI agents. They're sometime going to\n[28:50] deliver what you want and they're\n[28:51] sometimes going to fail miserably. And\n[28:52] you're going to learn that I had this\n[28:54] stupid word in there and it tripped up\n[28:55] the AI and it started doing all this\n[28:57] additional stuff that I didn't want\n[28:58] because of one or two words. stupid\n[29:00] things like error messages must be clear\n[29:02] or that's obviously something you want.\n[29:05] >> I mean, we're talking about a good\n[29:06] manager of of AI agents here because\n[29:10] like\n[29:11] >> that's the future to be honest,\n[29:13] >> but I'm I'm a little bit confused\n[29:14] because, you know, I'm a I'm a I'm a\n[29:17] middle manager as I mentioned before.\n[29:20] There's a few people that I work with.\n[29:22] Um I'm a lead in a team.\n[29:27] What does it mean for humans?\n[29:30] So, so what Theo was saying here, you\n[29:32] can become a good manager and the future\n[29:35] with AI adoption. The people that are\n[29:37] thriving are the ones that, you know,\n[29:39] have learned that their time isn't best\n[29:41] spent writing code. And I'm quoting Theo\n[29:43] exactly because I wrote it down. Um,\n[29:45] they're they they know that their time\n[29:47] isn't best spent writing code, but\n[29:49] better spent thinking about\n[29:50] >> Yeah. I mean, I'm just thinking aloud. I\n[29:52] mean, I guess I got to get my colleagues\n[29:55] to be managers, I suppose.\n[29:58] Yeah. Um\n[30:00] >> they all need to come up to\n[30:02] Yeah. learn these skills.\n[30:04] >> What's the other thing he said? Like the\n[30:06] future depends on their ability to\n[30:07] improve around delegation and\n[30:09] orchestration, planning and strategic\n[30:10] thinking, which is what I'm I have an an\n[30:13] interview tomorrow for like a staff\n[30:15] engineer position. And um\n[30:19] these questions trip me up, you know,\n[30:21] because every time I it's very I I use\n[30:24] CH GBT. I said I have here's a JD the\n[30:27] job description. Uh I gave my background\n[30:29] of what I've done in the last five\n[30:31] years. So it of of course it starts\n[30:33] glazing you saying yeah yeah yeah\n[30:35] perfect you can do all of this. Yeah I\n[30:36] don't care trust it. Um and I said look\n[30:39] we're going to do practice interview\n[30:41] right and it ask me these question and\n[30:43] you go into voice mode and it goes into\n[30:45] this very very it's it switches in\n[30:47] another mode. I'm sure I'm not making\n[30:49] this up. It go it switches in a special\n[30:51] interview mode that they built in\n[30:52] ChachiBT and it asks the question and\n[30:55] then it waits for your answer until you\n[30:58] stop talking and then it gives you the\n[30:59] feedback. You went too deep on this.\n[31:02] >> Yeah, it's amazing.\n[31:03] >> You're using you're using JT advanced\n[31:05] voice mode or something.\n[31:06] >> Yeah, I I used and play with it before,\n[31:09] but I I I thought you know\n[31:10] >> I find it stutters back at me more than\n[31:13] often.\n[31:14] >> Your internet connection is pretty bad I\n[31:16] think.\n[31:16] >> Oh no, no it isn't actually. Actually,\n[31:19] this this goes\n[31:20] >> you're probably on like a more than\n[31:22] >> on the topic of strategic thinking. I\n[31:24] for some reason I randomly watched this\n[31:26] video yesterday and it it didn't have\n[31:29] many views and it looked like clickbait,\n[31:32] but since I was doom scrolling, I I\n[31:35] watched it anyway because it it was\n[31:38] different to all the I was\n[31:39] watching last night.\n[31:44] on on the topic of strategic thinking. I\n[31:45] think it's quite interesting because as\n[31:47] a as a consultant when when I when I\n[31:49] join a client, you know, they have a\n[31:51] bunch of problems\n[31:53] and usually since I'm in delivery and uh\n[31:57] and usually since a client often doesn't\n[31:59] really have a good vision yet. I mean,\n[32:04] we we work on this problem, of course,\n[32:06] but but often I'm thrown into the the\n[32:09] deep end and uh we're just trying to\n[32:11] sort out the delivery and then often\n[32:14] there's lots of tasks in the backlog and\n[32:18] I just I end up basically saying yes to\n[32:21] a lot of these tasks. I will do them.\n[32:23] I'll do them. I'll do them. And\n[32:24] especially now that I have AI on my\n[32:26] back, I can do these things very very\n[32:28] quickly. I can just pick up cards. And I\n[32:32] guess in my in my in my my caveman mind,\n[32:35] I'm thinking like, you know, my velocity\n[32:38] is going to look insane. I'm going to\n[32:40] look great because I'm so much more\n[32:42] productive than um the other people on\n[32:44] this project. But it that's kind of\n[32:47] stupid thinking after watching the video\n[32:49] because because ultimately, you know, he\n[32:52] was pointing out that no one no one gets\n[32:54] like promoted or um by doing lots of\n[32:58] work. You know what I mean? Like that's\n[33:00] not how it works. You need strategic\n[33:02] thinking. It's about saying it's by by\n[33:04] showing that you've prioritized some\n[33:06] things over another for a particular\n[33:09] strategic reason. Uh it's it's about\n[33:12] saying no. It's about it's about\n[33:15] reaching a certain outcome. I mean, I do\n[33:18] try to reach an outcome when I'm in a\n[33:22] client project, but sometimes the the\n[33:23] outcome or the customer is just opaque\n[33:26] to me or um and I'm just doing the best\n[33:30] on the delivery front. I mean, that's\n[33:32] that's where I am in my career to be\n[33:34] honest. I'm in I'm in I'm in stone cold\n[33:37] delivery, but now but now stone cold\n[33:39] delivery is is somewhat solved by AI. I\n[33:43] want to move up in the food chain\n[33:47] and I'm actually just asking myself how\n[33:48] do I get there?\n[33:51] >> Yeah. So, Chachi gave those questions as\n[33:54] well in during my interview\n[33:55] specifically. How do you deal with\n[33:57] short-term priorities against long-term\n[33:59] goals? Um how do you deal with conflicts\n[34:02] like in terms of when you are um not\n[34:06] completely agreeing with the direction\n[34:07] something's going? So you know these\n[34:11] type of questions where I responded with\n[34:14] like examples of previous scenarios I\n[34:16] had been in and then it told me look the\n[34:18] things you did there and the way that\n[34:19] you work is clear communication setting\n[34:22] responsibility boundaries setting this\n[34:24] and that. So\n[34:26] >> uh so it's really focused on these um on\n[34:29] these um it's a good mock interview just\n[34:31] telling you and and also maybe it helps\n[34:33] you also clear form a better view. I\n[34:36] then practice with my family and every\n[34:38] time my son or my wife said something I\n[34:40] said look I hear you but how about we\n[34:42] are going\n[34:43] >> until they got like nause annoyed by it\n[34:46] >> you want to you want to drive to a\n[34:47] certain outcome and uh almost I mean\n[34:52] maybe I'm going to getting too adult by\n[34:54] the video that watch like you're almost\n[34:56] going into politics now or something\n[34:59] like that because\n[35:03] >> you're dealing politics\n[35:05] But the the the the advice I got from my\n[35:07] dad who's been project like working for\n[35:11] for his whole life project manager or\n[35:13] director and then he told me the most\n[35:16] important is when you go for such\n[35:19] interview is because I was like I'm not\n[35:21] prepared. I have all these things that I\n[35:22] I I I stumble on these questions like\n[35:25] all you have to do is pause and sound\n[35:27] like a reasonable human being. Make sure\n[35:29] you're well rested. Make sure you sound\n[35:31] like you uh you have logical thinking.\n[35:33] Nice.\n[35:34] >> Yeah.\n[35:35] >> And and and and and calm down just\n[35:38] >> Yeah. The the let me tell you just a\n[35:41] quick story like I was at I was in um a\n[35:44] private Catholic school in South Africa\n[35:47] and um there was lots of exams and I and\n[35:50] sometimes I would just struggle and then\n[35:52] the uh the sort of uh the headmaster uh\n[35:56] Mr. a he said to me, \"Kai, did you get a\n[36:00] good night's sleep?\" And I said,\n[36:01] \"Actually, no.\" I was kind of like\n[36:03] thinking about this and working through\n[36:04] this. He says, \"Go to bed early,\n[36:10] >> get a good rest.\" And then I I followed\n[36:12] his advice and I was like amazed how\n[36:15] much I mean I don't know if if the\n[36:19] results were immediate but I can't\n[36:21] really remember but I was amazed how\n[36:23] much how how less stress and how better\n[36:25] the exam went for me and I think the\n[36:27] results also reflected that and it was\n[36:29] just it was just such a simple thing.\n[36:32] That's true. I mean, I have the same\n[36:33] like every time I'm stuck uh working\n[36:35] late trying to get something over uh you\n[36:37] know, done and you don't know when to\n[36:39] stop. You just want to keep going and\n[36:41] ultimately you're too tired. You just go\n[36:43] to sleep and then you spend an hour and\n[36:46] when you wake up you wake up and you\n[36:48] think I could have done that in 5\n[36:50] minutes because honestly I was just\n[36:51] wrong at this point and I could have\n[36:53] just figured it out way faster\n[36:55] >> if I had a clear vision. If I had walked\n[36:57] away a little bit and and thought about\n[36:58] it. So\n[37:00] >> yeah, I'm just I'm just worried that\n[37:01] I've been doing things wrong for for so\n[37:03] long now because I guess I've just been\n[37:06] in this crazy delivery mode where I\n[37:09] just, you know, for me it's all been\n[37:12] about improving velocity, getting the CI\n[37:16] working, improving quality, build,\n[37:18] build, build build.\n[37:21] >> And AI is definitely making me reflect\n[37:23] on this all this stuff now.\n[37:26] >> Yeah. And I think that's\n[37:29] That's why, you know, I'm doing that\n[37:31] interview more as a practice round\n[37:32] because I'm not sure I'm going to get\n[37:34] it. Although that with all the good\n[37:35] advice, maybe I'm able to surface more\n[37:38] the qualities that I I do have the um\n[37:41] you know, I have dealt with those\n[37:42] situations. But like like you said, I\n[37:44] also went like heads down harder work to\n[37:46] get it done. Um which doesn't help in in\n[37:48] in like a collaborative environment\n[37:50] where we have to like communicate and\n[37:52] and find out and know how we can meet\n[37:55] the targets and things like that. Right.\n[37:56] So, I don't expect to get it, but I do\n[38:00] feel like with AI, I've learned a lot\n[38:03] more about pausing, planning, and taking\n[38:05] on more of a higher um, you know, level\n[38:07] or strategic thinking position. And I'm\n[38:10] trying to apply that in in this in this\n[38:12] open source thing that I'm doing based\n[38:14] on blue.\n[38:16] >> I mean, like your your CDF CDK terrain\n[38:19] or what was it called before? Uh,\n[38:22] >> CDKF. Yeah, CDK.\n[38:23] >> CDKF. Yeah. I mean, you're you're\n[38:25] becoming a credit a product owner and uh\n[38:27] I mean, do you have\n[38:30] I mean, hopefully you have some users\n[38:32] that you're getting some feedback from.\n[38:34] And\n[38:34] >> yeah,\n[38:35] >> if that's happening, then you're you're\n[38:36] on a good path already. You're in a\n[38:38] better place than I am. I mean, I\n[38:41] >> don't know if you remember, I did used\n[38:42] to have my own product uh webcon\n[38:44] converger.com\n[38:46] and own business to go with it. I mean I\n[38:47] was I was earning money\n[38:50] >> with it\n[38:51] >> and uh and that was my life for a few\n[38:54] years and it was good times in a way but\n[38:58] the\n[39:00] but I guess since it was like one man\n[39:02] band\n[39:03] >> you could revive it now you have a\n[39:05] fleet.\n[39:06] Yeah, I I don't think the, you know,\n[39:09] these kiosks that you see in libraries\n[39:11] and things like that, I don't I mean,\n[39:13] maybe digital signage is still a thing.\n[39:17] >> Um, but but the I'm not too sure the\n[39:20] market is there for for that product. Um\n[39:25] >> Mhm.\n[39:26] >> I mean, but yeah, you're right. I could\n[39:28] revive it. I I should I should I need to\n[39:31] become a product owner really. Uh just\n[39:33] like what you're trying to do. I mean or\n[39:35] what you are doing.\n[39:38] You got Souk and you got Vincent. You\n[39:40] got\n[39:41] >> It's my You got a few You got a few\n[39:43] personalities that I'm online.\n[39:46] >> I didn't realize I was logged in under a\n[39:48] different account and I was like, \"Oh,\n[39:49] whatever. I don't care.\" I could have\n[39:51] deleted and do it again.\n[39:52] >> Yeah. So, I wish you like I mean, we\n[39:55] should we should turn this podcast and\n[39:57] like how to have a successful business\n[40:01] a successful product owner. Um\n[40:04] I I guess so this is still does this\n[40:06] have a business are you going to are you\n[40:09] going to get people to pay for it\n[40:10] >> somehow?\n[40:11] >> No, absolutely not. This is open source.\n[40:14] >> Oh god.\n[40:15] >> How are you going to pay for the\n[40:19] >> there are companies depending on this\n[40:20] >> Vietnamese soups?\n[40:23] >> I don't I don't know that's not on the\n[40:24] prim that's okay. The first and foremost\n[40:26] I do this because I want this tool. I\n[40:28] don't want it to die. I've I built terra\n[40:32] constructs because I'm tired of\n[40:33] terapform modules and I don't want to\n[40:35] write another line of terapform module\n[40:37] code in my life ever again. So well\n[40:40] that's too much. Of course if I'm look\n[40:42] looking for an opportunity and they are\n[40:43] on terapform modules I'm not going to\n[40:44] force them to use my library. Um I'm\n[40:46] just going to keep telling them every\n[40:48] time I'm upset.\n[40:49] >> Can I just relate? I had a I've been\n[40:51] debugging furiously the last two days a\n[40:54] CDK issue at the client. it was the\n[40:56] circular dependency uh problem\n[40:59] >> and I don't feel I would have hit that\n[41:00] with Terraform. I don't know do you have\n[41:02] any opinions about circular\n[41:03] dependencies?\n[41:05] There's so many companies when I come\n[41:07] into organizations that have rolled out\n[41:08] Terraform without having any prior\n[41:10] experience into it and a common scenario\n[41:12] is they they try to centralize um like\n[41:16] the classic thing about security for\n[41:18] example this module does all of the IM\n[41:20] roles this module does all of the\n[41:21] security groups because this is like the\n[41:22] central IT type of setup whereas uh\n[41:26] you're you're going vertical this\n[41:27] product owns this security group this IM\n[41:29] role this belongs to that product it's\n[41:31] like vertical slice versus horizontal\n[41:34] But the trouble is that in this\n[41:35] particular client they've gone CDK\n[41:38] across the whole platform in like they\n[41:42] have a storage stack, a security stack,\n[41:43] a network stack.\n[41:45] >> Yeah. So the storage stack gets a bit\n[41:48] mad.\n[41:49] >> So of course you're going to have\n[41:50] vertical and and uh teams are going to\n[41:52] own shared resources. So you must uh but\n[41:56] usually the type of cycles you describe\n[41:58] happen in terapform similarly as in\n[42:00] cloud formation which is you are\n[42:02] creating a security group over here and\n[42:04] then you are um you know creating the\n[42:07] thing over there and then you need to\n[42:09] cross references and they end up\n[42:10] depending of each other and now you have\n[42:11] to deploy this first and then you have\n[42:13] to apply that and then you have to\n[42:14] >> I was just I guess I was just a bit\n[42:17] >> I was just a little bit I thought maybe\n[42:20] the the ergonomics of the CDK developer\n[42:22] experience was not\n[42:24] cuz I feel like with terraform when when\n[42:26] I see dependency issues it's very clear\n[42:29] because the way the way that this\n[42:31] problem\n[42:31] >> this is not a CDK like please use the\n[42:33] word AWS CDK when you talk about cloud\n[42:35] form okay because\n[42:37] >> because I do not use cloud form I use\n[42:40] CDK for terraform and now CDK terrain\n[42:43] where all everything you said about like\n[42:45] CDK doesn't give me the clarity it's AWS\n[42:47] CDK doesn't give you that\n[42:48] >> yeah yeah the AWS CDK tool yeah yeah\n[42:50] you're right and okay god this is going\n[42:52] to be difficult to talk about have to\n[42:54] prefix everything with AWS. So the way\n[42:57] that this problem manifested itself with\n[42:59] the AWS CDK uh diff it it showed like\n[43:02] all these IM changes\n[43:05] and then an AWS CDK deploy\n[43:09] basically\n[43:11] bailed out because of all these circular\n[43:14] uh dependencies.\n[43:15] >> Yeah, cloud formation can be very\n[43:17] painful. Uh Terraform is going to tell\n[43:18] you that very quickly. It's going to say\n[43:20] I cannot plan this because there's a\n[43:21] cycle detected early. If you do it\n[43:23] within Exactly. So, so I guess my my my\n[43:26] moan is about how diff and and and\n[43:29] deploy\n[43:30] >> were like\n[43:32] >> not really lining up very well. I mean,\n[43:35] >> yeah,\n[43:36] >> it confused a lot of people and then I\n[43:38] then as the most experienced person on\n[43:41] the project, I picked it up and I was\n[43:42] like banging my head for two days.\n[43:45] >> Yeah. So, so the thing is that's exactly\n[43:47] why I am doing what I'm doing which is I\n[43:50] love AWS CDK developer experience but I\n[43:54] do not like the things that you just\n[43:55] described which is problems with cloud\n[43:57] form not uh you know the same\n[44:00] flexibility in how I do my plan and diff\n[44:03] because uh with cl with terapform you\n[44:05] have atlantis automation that you can\n[44:07] use you have so many tooling around it\n[44:09] you because with AWS CDK you are tied to\n[44:12] the cloud for runners of AWS and however\n[44:15] they make it available. It has pros\n[44:17] because you don't have to deploy your\n[44:19] runners. You don't have to worry about\n[44:20] the state where you're going to store it\n[44:21] because cloud form is taking care of all\n[44:23] of it. It's all it's a full package\n[44:24] solution. It even does the full roll\n[44:26] back. You can do it across regions. It's\n[44:27] amazing. But I do not like it. Terraform\n[44:30] is is way more flexible. You control\n[44:32] where you put your state. You control\n[44:33] how you do your runners. Do you do it in\n[44:35] GitHub workflows? Do you do it with a\n[44:36] dedicated instance? Do you use\n[44:38] spacelift? You can choose everything you\n[44:39] want. So, so that's why I'm working on\n[44:42] CDK terrain and that's why I'm working\n[44:43] on my library.\n[44:45] >> On the topic of CDK, another thing that\n[44:47] sort of blew my mind was that the the\n[44:51] client uh hadn't updated AW CDK uh\n[44:55] library for uh for for like two years.\n[44:59] No joke.\n[45:01] and uh and that's something that I had\n[45:03] to pick up\n[45:05] >> and I picked it up and and when I looked\n[45:07] at the change log um you know over a\n[45:10] period of two years I was a little bit\n[45:13] uh how do you say\n[45:16] shocked at how many breaking changes\n[45:18] there were cuz because this is a a large\n[45:21] landscape I'm upgrading the CDK library\n[45:23] across and I'm like oh um you know\n[45:27] oh oh Oh\n[45:33] Almost every release there's a breaking\n[45:35] change.\n[45:36] >> Terapform provider AWS from version 4 to\n[45:39] 5 to six have also breaking changes that\n[45:42] you want to upgrade the provider you\n[45:43] have to change the way that you write\n[45:44] your security group rules. Uh they need\n[45:46] to be individual resources.\n[45:48] >> I mean I don't remember this being the\n[45:50] experience in terraform. I mean I was I\n[45:52] was shocked. I was like, \"No, no, no.\n[45:55] This is not happening to me.\"\n[45:57] >> Because the same the same happened.\n[45:58] >> This is I mean I\n[46:00] >> Is it the same in Terraform?\n[46:01] >> I just told you. Yeah. Terraform\n[46:03] provider AWS version 4 versus\n[46:05] >> Sorry, I thought you were talking about\n[46:06] um\n[46:07] >> No.\n[46:08] >> So this is the same this is the same\n[46:09] problem in terraform. Okay.\n[46:11] >> Yeah. If you have a very old version of\n[46:12] Terapform provider AWS version 4 and you\n[46:15] need to go to some feature that like\n[46:18] some for example SNS topic true is is a\n[46:21] thing that was missing a property that\n[46:23] was added on the SNS service and it's\n[46:25] only available in in provider version\n[46:27] v6. So you have to upgrade to version v6\n[46:30] and there's quite a few breaking changes\n[46:31] from 4 to 6. So you're going to and that\n[46:34] was even worse when you were in\n[46:35] Terraform 0 0.12 to uh 0 before it was\n[46:39] v1.\n[46:39] >> You're right. You're right. You're\n[46:41] right.\n[46:42] >> Yeah.\n[46:44] >> Okay. I guess I'm just looking at\n[46:46] Terraform\n[46:47] in with\n[46:49] it.\n[46:50] >> I think Terraform surfaces these issues.\n[46:52] Um again, the problem with AWS CDK that\n[46:55] I will agree with and that everyone\n[46:56] tells me when I talk about it, it's the\n[46:57] additional complexity. This is this\n[46:59] accidental complexity versus because now\n[47:02] I mean imagine this. AWS has a team\n[47:05] within AWS that builds a service SNS or\n[47:08] IM team or another one, right? They\n[47:10] build an API. These are all not\n[47:12] identical, right? We I think we talked\n[47:14] about this. You said that's weird\n[47:15] because Jeff Bezos\n[47:18] dictates that everything needs to go\n[47:19] through an API, but SC was every team is\n[47:21] building their own API around their\n[47:23] services. So some like for example if\n[47:25] you use API gateway and you want to set\n[47:27] uh a different integration method\n[47:29] parameter you need to JSON patch it into\n[47:32] like a you know you need to send a JSON\n[47:34] patch to modify the object there's no\n[47:36] individual like sub resources like what\n[47:38] you expect with REST things like that\n[47:40] right different services different APIs\n[47:42] now from those services people wrote a\n[47:45] Terraform provider manually right and\n[47:48] they're going to like abstract the\n[47:49] configuration away they're going to take\n[47:51] the way that Jason Right. And then\n[47:54] >> and for the most part they've done a\n[47:55] great job but like it's yeah it's hard.\n[47:57] >> Okay. And then you have these resources\n[47:59] right that are basically kind of an\n[48:01] abstraction on top of those APIs. And\n[48:03] now we are building another abstraction\n[48:06] on top of it which is like these L2\n[48:07] constructs which are basically wrapping\n[48:10] those APIs uh wrapping those resources\n[48:12] which are wrapping those APIs which is\n[48:14] like\n[48:15] >> how many layers in between are we here?\n[48:16] Like this is ridiculous right? Yeah, we\n[48:18] talked about this before, but like I I I\n[48:21] was naive or or something cuz I always\n[48:23] thought that that there was some sort of\n[48:26] common I thought it was called Mason or\n[48:28] something. Misison or\n[48:30] Amazon.\n[48:31] >> Yeah, we talked to we had\n[48:32] >> Yeah. and and that was and that was\n[48:34] splitting out things and you pointed to\n[48:35] that project which was I think more akin\n[48:37] to that but in reality people are using\n[48:40] Terraform provider and this uh CDK\n[48:43] library and we're basically\n[48:45] >> in this world of pain in a way because\n[48:49] it's man dude like this month debug\n[48:53] session with all these breaking changes\n[48:54] over a two-year library jump was\n[48:59] you know not fun.\n[49:02] >> Yeah.\n[49:02] >> Not fun. And and and to be honest, we\n[49:04] haven't deployed it into UAT yet. It's\n[49:07] only just in dev.\n[49:09] >> And and the trouble is like I feel or\n[49:12] maybe I'm taking things too personally,\n[49:14] but like I do the work. I own the I own\n[49:16] this sort of migration,\n[49:18] which is a result really of people not\n[49:20] keeping dependencies up to date. And\n[49:23] then any any feedback about things\n[49:25] breaking is going to come back to me.\n[49:27] Oh, Kai, it's it's your fault. Your\n[49:30] fault. Your fault. Your fault. Your\n[49:31] fault. Like\n[49:32] >> so DevOps is the thank most thankless\n[49:35] job, right? In like platform engineer.\n[49:37] >> Yeah. And then there's no tests for all\n[49:39] these like I have like I have zero\n[49:41] confidence that that the test suite\n[49:43] managed to capture any of these breaking\n[49:45] changes.\n[49:45] >> That's the problem. That's the problem\n[49:47] with how the industry has approach\n[49:48] approach the platform engineering. They\n[49:51] they still clinging to config files and\n[49:54] and and and saying that yeah we can't\n[49:56] test the system. Like just a few days\n[49:58] ago, somebody uh from Terra team posted\n[50:01] Malcolm posted um the thing people don't\n[50:04] understand is that you cannot test your\n[50:07] infrastructure the same way that you\n[50:08] test your programs. And I'm like yes you\n[50:11] can. And he's like no you can't because\n[50:14] when you do your network in production\n[50:16] and you set up your security rules or\n[50:17] your networking rules there's no way for\n[50:18] you to test that. Only in production you\n[50:21] can validate that it works the way it\n[50:22] should. And I'm like, but I agree with\n[50:25] that. But there are things that you can\n[50:27] test in the middle. Like you can test\n[50:29] patterns. You can build patterns.\n[50:31] >> Have you heard this project? Have you\n[50:32] heard of this project? I thought you\n[50:34] might have used it. Goss.\n[50:36] >> I've seen it, but I don't remember.\n[50:38] >> I think it's like um\n[50:41] wait, it's like YAML driven\n[50:45] infrastructure testing like\n[50:47] >> Oh,\n[50:48] >> test for certain things. And\n[50:50] >> I used\n[50:51] >> I used RSpec once which is like Ruby on\n[50:54] real uh Ruby based uh service\n[50:57] specification testing.\n[51:01] >> Yeah, man. I'm a bit depressed. I think\n[51:03] the next few days with this roll out and\n[51:05] everything breaking around me, I'm going\n[51:07] to get so much heat.\n[51:09] >> Yeah. So, so you you you touched on two\n[51:11] points because you said first um you're\n[51:14] doing all the work and you're only\n[51:15] getting contacted about breakage. nobody\n[51:18] appreciate the work that you're doing.\n[51:20] And second, we talked about there are no\n[51:22] test.\n[51:22] >> Well, I don't I'm not looking for\n[51:23] appreciation. I'm just looking for like\n[51:25] >> No, no, look, this is this is\n[51:26] >> understanding about this this I mean\n[51:28] like this 2-year AWS CDK upgrade is is\n[51:32] an absolute nightmare in a in a very in\n[51:34] a in a very I mean we're talking like\n[51:36] like\n[51:39] >> and what are you doing double digit AWS\n[51:42] accounts?\n[51:43] >> What are you doing to prevent this from\n[51:44] happening again?\n[51:46] bloody definitely going to update the uh\n[51:50] the py project toml every freaking\n[51:53] release.\n[51:54] >> No, but like what do you do to make sure\n[51:56] that that going forward every time a new\n[51:59] AWS CDK version is released, every\n[52:01] single um piece of infrastructure that\n[52:04] uses AWS CDK gets a bump?\n[52:07] >> Well, that's a good question. I mean we\n[52:10] we need a process where we we we do have\n[52:13] incremental changes.\n[52:16] >> Yeah. So there's two parts to the\n[52:18] problem here like there's I'm focusing\n[52:20] I'm a platform engineer so I'm doing the\n[52:22] I'm doing the platform up uh AW CDK\n[52:25] library upgrade\n[52:26] >> that that's that's two years in the\n[52:28] making\n[52:28] >> but this utility library is also shared\n[52:31] with all the uh the data products in\n[52:32] this platform.\n[52:34] >> So so basically the CDK is going to\n[52:36] update for two years. So all the all the\n[52:38] um the data products depending on this\n[52:40] library have now got a 2-year bump in\n[52:43] their CDK.\n[52:44] Uh thankfully most data products don't\n[52:47] use the CDK but some do.\n[52:50] And of course like like Kinesis Fire\n[52:52] Hose went from alpha to stable. I mean\n[52:55] every anything that has kinesis in it. I\n[52:57] I'm I'm I mean yeah I'm having to work\n[53:01] on my own platform but like sending PRs\n[53:03] to product teams saying like um oh by\n[53:05] the way uh you probably need to update\n[53:07] this code here and this code here and\n[53:09] this code here\n[53:10] >> and I mean I've even been doing PRs. I\n[53:13] mean the workload is insane but like\n[53:15] thankfully with AI it's trivial to to\n[53:18] conjure up a PR uh when but but still\n[53:22] it's it's an absolute nightmare. And\n[53:23] then\n[53:24] >> okay but hold on can we just discuss\n[53:26] this one second because you keep saying\n[53:28] because of CDK this we now have to do\n[53:30] that. I tell you I worked with Terraform\n[53:32] modules for 4 years in an organization\n[53:34] with 40 plus um done at the end of it 50\n[53:38] different AWS accounts and it's worse.\n[53:42] Guess what? You need a custom uh you\n[53:45] know library and packaging system to\n[53:46] actually put in place something like\n[53:48] dependabot. you at least if you're on\n[53:50] CDK you have dependabot you have you\n[53:53] know procedures to manage these version\n[53:55] bumps because you have semantic uh\n[53:57] >> there's dependabot for terraform by the\n[53:59] way\n[54:00] >> yeah custom made because it's so niche\n[54:02] and dumb because it doesn't have a\n[54:04] proper like like like versioning like\n[54:06] package managing system\n[54:08] >> it's part of GitHub uh dependabot it's\n[54:11] >> yeah because they have to build so I\n[54:13] understand you have this dependabot\n[54:14] supports the golang ecosystem supports j\n[54:17] um javascript ecosystem supports Java,\n[54:19] NVM, Maven, Nugat. So it knows all of\n[54:22] these registries. All of these have like\n[54:23] proper semantics on on like you can\n[54:26] define I accept up to this version and\n[54:28] so bumps can be controlled all of that,\n[54:31] right? But\n[54:32] >> not ter\n[54:34] >> only if you pay for the registry from\n[54:36] Hashi Corp.\n[54:39] Oh god,\n[54:40] >> you cannot like\n[54:42] maybe dependable they they have added\n[54:44] the ability to define a version\n[54:46] constraint but in the past when you use\n[54:48] terafform modules you can only put it on\n[54:51] an S3 bucket or you put it in git tag\n[54:53] and those and it does not comp um\n[54:55] support um a query mechanism. So only if\n[54:58] you use hashi corp registry you can\n[55:00] actually define a a version constraint\n[55:02] that says I accept all major like\n[55:04] anything but not pass this major\n[55:06] version. So I accept all the minor\n[55:07] bumps. I accept all the patch bumps and\n[55:09] this is a paint only feature which is\n[55:11] ridiculous.\n[55:13] >> Yeah. But like to be honest the the I\n[55:16] don't know if you work like which line\n[55:18] which language you work with in CDK\n[55:20] because the Python upgrade story is not\n[55:23] great in my opinion.\n[55:25] >> Yeah. No, I I use TypeScript because if\n[55:27] you want to do a cross compilation, you\n[55:28] can only do it from TypeScript to the\n[55:30] other languages. So if you are a\n[55:32] producer of packages, you must use\n[55:34] TypeScript. If you're a consumer, you\n[55:36] can use Python, Golang, Java. You cannot\n[55:38] produce\n[55:39] >> the NodeJS gang knows how to update uh\n[55:42] their package or JSON.\n[55:44] >> They've got but like the\n[55:46] >> they have like 20 different ways of\n[55:48] updating your packages.\n[55:49] >> Exactly. But in the Python world, um\n[55:52] yeah, there's 20 different ways to\n[55:54] updating uh well, you know,\n[55:56] requirements.ext text your py project\n[55:58] tunnel\n[56:01] >> in language ecosystem at least the\n[56:02] things like Google but even golang is\n[56:04] kind of a horrible mess\n[56:06] >> go go get minus you is uh\n[56:10] >> yeah but go packaging has been solved\n[56:12] years ago\n[56:13] >> try to work with private and then uh you\n[56:15] need to you private go modules\n[56:19] >> yeah so it's been a while you want what\n[56:22] are you going to ask me like it's broken\n[56:24] oh god\n[56:25] >> no you have like um you have to have\n[56:28] like a way to expose the the key towards\n[56:31] it um like SSH but if you have like two\n[56:34] different um I remember it being a huge\n[56:37] mess like very painful there are\n[56:39] workarounds but it's\n[56:41] >> anyway yeah I agree with you languages\n[56:42] now have good story\n[56:44] >> I I agree with you that that upgrading\n[56:47] dependencies is the bane of my is is a\n[56:51] very common\n[56:53] problem in in our industry and and um\n[56:57] yeah, I mean I'm just picking out the\n[56:59] pieces here, but like in future I want\n[57:01] to get the platform to to increment\n[57:04] dependency updates all the time.\n[57:06] >> Yes, exactly. And there's an extra bonus\n[57:09] charge of getting data products.\n[57:11] >> And there's there's there's a there's a\n[57:14] culture I would say in especially in the\n[57:15] data product. This is not relating to my\n[57:17] current client, but I've seen it in\n[57:19] other places like like when the data\n[57:20] when the data engineers get their data\n[57:22] product working in Airflow, they're\n[57:24] like, \"Don't touch it. It's working\n[57:27] now.\"\n[57:28] >> And in the end, I have no idea how to\n[57:30] validate it.\n[57:31] >> And like, you know, I hate this data\n[57:33] engineer because the these guys\n[57:35] often\n[57:37] They get like they get treated like\n[57:38] royalty\n[57:40] >> and then they get treated like a royalty\n[57:42] and the platform engineers the people\n[57:44] who make it work are like yeah that\n[57:46] platform engineer has been blocking me\n[57:49] anyway. Yeah,\n[57:50] >> this is such a common data versus\n[57:51] platform\n[57:52] >> and then once they get it working it's\n[57:53] like don't touch it ever\n[57:57] and like dude you need to update it.\n[57:59] It's running a library that's been, you\n[58:02] know, vulnerable for two years now. And\n[58:08] oh my god, this is my life.\n[58:11] >> But maybe AI can make it better. Maybe I\n[58:14] can uh do a surgical update and uh force\n[58:17] people to um test it.\n[58:19] >> There's no is there no feedback loop or\n[58:21] validation mechanism then AI is just\n[58:23] going to make a bigger mess. But my\n[58:25] friend also just moved from being more\n[58:27] of um you know consultant um customerf\n[58:30] facing towards uh he he was he he went\n[58:33] full stack and he was very excited to go\n[58:35] into devops and and platform because he\n[58:37] loved setting up the networks and having\n[58:39] the control and then he worked\n[58:41] >> setting up networks. How can you love\n[58:42] doing that? That's so\n[58:44] >> And then if you haven't done it before\n[58:45] it's fun. Uh and then he started working\n[58:47] at a few companies and then he was like\n[58:49] exactly what you just told me. He was so\n[58:52] getting so frustrated and I told them\n[58:53] welcome to this side of the fence where\n[58:56] the only thing you get is complaints but\n[58:58] it's not always true. I have worked in\n[59:00] companies where they do go the extra\n[59:02] mile and say look the DevOps team really\n[59:04] did like went all the way here to help\n[59:06] us this not not often but sometime do\n[59:10] and I did also get appreciation for like\n[59:13] fixing um you know like a big outage um\n[59:18] that helped. Oh, you fixed an outage\n[59:22] >> and normally under my leadership there\n[59:25] won't be outage.\n[59:27] >> Yeah. So, normally you get just like\n[59:30] everyone on your back. But in this case,\n[59:32] they were like, \"What do you need?\" And\n[59:34] okay, I trust you and when it's done,\n[59:36] thank you so much. Like it's not often,\n[59:39] but\n[59:40] >> you do get those.\n[59:42] >> Yeah. I feel like I've I've messed up a\n[59:43] bit here, especially with the CDK\n[59:45] upgrade. I should have perhaps\n[59:48] a\n[59:49] doesn't doesn't help that uh when we we\n[59:52] we had an initial conversation about the\n[59:54] CDK upgrade uh my colleague said, \"Oh, I\n[59:57] think we need two days to do this.\" And\n[59:59] then two days later it's like um I\n[1:00:03] basically picked it up and I'm like, \"Oh\n[1:00:05] god, we should have said we need we need\n[1:00:08] weeks for this.\" I didn't realize it was\n[1:00:09] a 2-year\n[1:00:11] gap year.\n[1:00:13] >> Yeah.\n[1:00:14] You know, the reason why I was like\n[1:00:16] happy, this is a funny story to lighten\n[1:00:18] up boot a little bit. I don't know if\n[1:00:20] it's funny. I'm I'm going to try not not\n[1:00:22] rant, but basically my job recently with\n[1:00:25] the CDK terrain is to migrate all of the\n[1:00:29] archives repositories, mirror them, and\n[1:00:31] get them building again, right? So the\n[1:00:34] Hashi Corp when they shut it down, they\n[1:00:35] they closed off a whole bunch of\n[1:00:37] repositories. The funny thing is all of\n[1:00:39] that is very automated, by the way. So\n[1:00:41] closing them was very fast, but\n[1:00:42] reopening them is also very fast because\n[1:00:44] I just need to run a couple of of\n[1:00:45] workflows. Like they have the original\n[1:00:47] GitHub workflow that would deprecate\n[1:00:48] them and I just took that one and I have\n[1:00:50] to like reactivate them. So it's like\n[1:00:53] dispatch and it goes and does the thing.\n[1:00:55] Now the biggest problem is mirroring git\n[1:00:57] repos that are like 6 GB. So the the\n[1:01:00] teraphone provider AWS is a 6 GB git\n[1:01:03] repository when you try to download it\n[1:01:05] and when you try to mirror it. Yeah. So\n[1:01:08] most of them are just like 2 GB. The\n[1:01:10] biggest one is is\n[1:01:12] >> so 6 GB of\n[1:01:16] >> git this the raw git data is 6 7 GB and\n[1:01:20] the Golang library is 7.7 GB.\n[1:01:23] >> I don't understand how can a git\n[1:01:25] repository be that big\n[1:01:27] >> I guess because of all the automation.\n[1:01:29] So this also brings me to the point that\n[1:01:31] I told everyone we need the gar garbage\n[1:01:33] collection mechanism because there's\n[1:01:34] just too much data in the because you\n[1:01:36] know it autogenerates a lot of code\n[1:01:38] right it takes the terapform that sounds\n[1:01:41] way bigger than the Linux distribution I\n[1:01:43] mean the Linux uh git repository\n[1:01:45] >> I keep hearing weird noises anyway so\n[1:01:47] the point I was making that I was happy\n[1:01:49] about is I was trying to do this m this\n[1:01:51] I told cloud code working with opus come\n[1:01:53] up with the plan on how to migrate and\n[1:01:55] fork these repositories cuz reactivating\n[1:01:57] them is okay once they're there just\n[1:01:59] they need to be there. So I need to like\n[1:02:01] G bear clone the repo then push mirror\n[1:02:05] to the new. So clicking fork in GitHub\n[1:02:08] ties the repositories together and any\n[1:02:10] contributions are not attributed\n[1:02:12] >> until they're merged. So if you have an\n[1:02:14] archive repository and you fork it,\n[1:02:16] that's not good. You need to actually\n[1:02:18] create a new repo and then clone and\n[1:02:20] push mirror the the thing. Uh and and we\n[1:02:23] we built a script and it was working\n[1:02:25] great for all of the repos I did until I\n[1:02:27] hit this 7 GB one and it kept failing\n[1:02:29] over and over and over and over.\n[1:02:32] >> Linux is about seven.\n[1:02:35] >> Yeah. So, so, so then the thing that\n[1:02:37] that that um\n[1:02:40] that was funny because I was going to\n[1:02:41] sell tell a funny story is that today\n[1:02:45] after you know I was doing this on\n[1:02:47] Tuesday or or Monday and uh I finally\n[1:02:50] give up and said to everyone look um the\n[1:02:52] AWS one is going to take a bit longer.\n[1:02:54] There's uh a 2 GB pack limit. So even if\n[1:02:58] man even when I was chunking it and\n[1:02:59] sending it in bits and pieces the pieces\n[1:03:01] were still too big. uh they were more\n[1:03:03] than two gigabyte and that's the limit\n[1:03:05] that you can send a pack. Um and then\n[1:03:07] finally because I ran out of cloud code\n[1:03:10] I asked open codes to look into it which\n[1:03:12] is uh JPT 5.2. I was using chach 5.2\n[1:03:17] codeex but everyone tells me.2\n[1:03:20] you quick question what's the difference\n[1:03:21] between 5.2 and 5.2 codeex. I don't even\n[1:03:24] understand anymore. I maybe Codex is\n[1:03:27] trained more carefully on tools use\n[1:03:29] because I have to say codeex is pretty\n[1:03:31] good at tools but GPT 5.2 was uh\n[1:03:34] constantly failing to replace strings\n[1:03:35] and things like that. So tool use u it\n[1:03:38] spent 10 minutes 10 minutes it was uh\n[1:03:41] looking at\n[1:03:42] >> using 5.2 codeex okay yeah\n[1:03:44] >> no codeex was fast uh but today I\n[1:03:46] switched to 5.2 two. Um,\n[1:03:48] >> oh my god,\n[1:03:50] >> no codeex. And and it spent 10 minutes.\n[1:03:52] So I was like literally I forgot about\n[1:03:54] it. I asked, \"Hey, look at this error\n[1:03:55] messages I get when I'm trying to do a\n[1:03:58] >> I was working on something else.\" And I\n[1:03:59] went back to the tab and I was like,\n[1:04:00] \"Hold on a minute. This thing is still\n[1:04:02] running.\" Like open code is still\n[1:04:03] running GPT for 10 minutes. I was like,\n[1:04:05] \"What's going on?\" And and then it\n[1:04:07] stopped after a while. No, it wasn't.\n[1:04:09] >> What does What does What does open code\n[1:04:10] say when it's, you know, like Claude\n[1:04:12] says combobulating?\n[1:04:14] >> Uh, I don't remember. But but um what\n[1:04:19] after a while it stopped and\n[1:04:22] what's funny is one of the first thing\n[1:04:24] it says you know I could just use the\n[1:04:26] GitHub import functionality but the\n[1:04:28] users asking me to fix the you know the\n[1:04:30] chunking and so on. I was like, \"Hold on\n[1:04:32] a minute. GitHub import functionality.\n[1:04:35] What are you talking about?\"\n[1:04:38] That's funny how they like, you know,\n[1:04:40] how they go there. And and I'm like,\n[1:04:42] \"What the hell?\" I worked on this for\n[1:04:43] two days with Opus and it never even,\n[1:04:46] you know, suggested to use the GitHub\n[1:04:48] import function um feature. I don't know\n[1:04:50] what this is, but if it sounds\n[1:04:53] >> I think it I think it took 10 minutes\n[1:04:55] actually to copy 6 GB uh repository but\n[1:04:58] while I was talking with you I got a\n[1:05:00] message saying um your import has\n[1:05:01] completed. I was like oh yeah it's been\n[1:05:04] stuck for two days. I would have liked\n[1:05:06] to be able to do it myself like I I set\n[1:05:08] up a 2x large runner in the US right\n[1:05:10] next to I hope one of the data centers\n[1:05:12] of GitHub so that I can get the data\n[1:05:14] like it's going very fast but\n[1:05:16] >> why don't you just pull it down into\n[1:05:18] your own good repo? I mean,\n[1:05:21] >> yes. Yes. Sure. Sure. Kai\n[1:05:23] >> selfhost.\n[1:05:24] >> Yeah. Not of course.\n[1:05:26] >> Oh my god. Am I bleeding? God,\n[1:05:28] >> you you\n[1:05:29] >> scratching myself.\n[1:05:31] >> Um,\n[1:05:32] >> anyway, that was the\n[1:05:34] >> You got the You managed to fork it.\n[1:05:37] >> Yes, the provider AWS is ready and now I\n[1:05:41] just need to build it. I'm using Depot.\n[1:05:43] Um I'm hoping that they will sponsor the\n[1:05:45] project because their runners are really\n[1:05:48] fast. Uh much cheaper.\n[1:05:50] >> Sorry. Pone. What's that?\n[1:05:53] >> It's um it's a GitHub runner\n[1:05:56] >> tool.\n[1:05:59] >> Yeah.\n[1:06:04] >> So it's like Docker Hub type thing or\n[1:06:07] something or\n[1:06:08] >> No, no, no.deaf. You know how in GitHub\n[1:06:11] actions you can run your own runners and\n[1:06:13] some people set up like EC2 autoscalers\n[1:06:15] to bring up the runners\n[1:06:17] >> and then they recently had to change the\n[1:06:18] pricing policies so you get charged for\n[1:06:20] your own runners.\n[1:06:21] >> Yes. And then GitHub changed the the\n[1:06:23] rules saying that control plane also now\n[1:06:25] is being charged. So all of these people\n[1:06:26] getting like a free lunch with with\n[1:06:28] Microsoft you know delegating jobs for\n[1:06:31] free and scheduling jobs everywhere. Um\n[1:06:34] they are now upset because like why do\n[1:06:36] you change it? But I think they reverted\n[1:06:38] some of the thing already. Uh anyway,\n[1:06:40] depot and then of course a whole\n[1:06:42] business was created of people providing\n[1:06:46] runners for you because the the margin\n[1:06:49] uh between running an EC2 instance and\n[1:06:52] um the cost you pay for\n[1:06:53] >> why would you have your own runner just\n[1:06:55] for speed\n[1:06:57] >> um\n[1:06:58] >> or privacy or something.\n[1:06:59] >> Yeah, it could be that you want to run\n[1:07:00] the EC the GitHub runner inside your\n[1:07:02] network. So you want to run it inside\n[1:07:04] your VPC of this particular account. So\n[1:07:06] it has access to different uh private in\n[1:07:08] like endpoints. For example, you have a\n[1:07:11] net uh I server to to trigger deploy.\n[1:07:14] >> I had those networking\n[1:07:16] situations.\n[1:07:17] >> Yeah. But just use\n[1:07:18] >> so so why are you using them just\n[1:07:20] because they it's just some extra beef\n[1:07:24] >> or why you have\n[1:07:25] >> so the providers the the terraform\n[1:07:27] providers are massive and to build them\n[1:07:29] uh you need to set the node uh memory\n[1:07:32] limits and you need to in some cases run\n[1:07:36] it on more than just uh two core was it\n[1:07:39] 2 GB or 4 GB default runner from GitHub.\n[1:07:42] So, this one's Hashi Corp is using eight\n[1:07:45] cores and 32 GB memory machines. So, I'm\n[1:07:49] using and um they're giving me a 7-day\n[1:07:52] trial to and and it builds the providers\n[1:07:54] super fast.\n[1:07:55] >> What what what does GitHub give you? I\n[1:07:56] think you we talked about this before\n[1:07:58] like black isn't this like blacksmith\n[1:08:00] GitHub, right?\n[1:08:00] >> There's blacksmith, there's runs on\n[1:08:02] there's there's quite a few of them that\n[1:08:04] do the same thing. And like I said,\n[1:08:05] there's a whole uh ecosystem very\n[1:08:08] similar to like there's a whole\n[1:08:09] ecosystem.\n[1:08:11] >> Does GitHub charge you more money if you\n[1:08:13] if you basically specify a bigger runner\n[1:08:15] or something? I don't know how it works.\n[1:08:18] >> Yeah. So to to be able to even use\n[1:08:20] bigger runners, you have to pay $5 per\n[1:08:22] person per se.\n[1:08:24] >> How come is\n[1:08:25] >> which is ridiculous.\n[1:08:26] >> Is is there a web page talking about the\n[1:08:30] runners? I can't see the\n[1:08:31] >> So I have on my repos on my other\n[1:08:34] organization where I have nobody else\n[1:08:36] but me. I actually had someone else but\n[1:08:37] I kicked them out because I have to pay\n[1:08:39] $5 per seat to even run a bigger runner.\n[1:08:42] And then I get charged on the runner\n[1:08:44] minutes on top of that as well. So if\n[1:08:45] you are like five people working on an\n[1:08:47] open source project, you're already\n[1:08:49] paying $20 plus all of the billable\n[1:08:51] minutes that you get for those large\n[1:08:52] runners. It's it's insanely expensive.\n[1:08:55] Where if I use depot.dev, dev I get much\n[1:08:58] faster and much cheaper um runners.\n[1:09:02] I hope they sponsor me. I mean the the\n[1:09:04] project, not me, but the the open source\n[1:09:07] project.\n[1:09:12] >> Yeah, I mean there there was a thing on\n[1:09:14] Hacker News yesterday about how someone\n[1:09:17] hates GitHub with a GitHub runners,\n[1:09:20] GitHub actions with a passion. And it it\n[1:09:22] all comes down to for me for me my\n[1:09:25] interpretation is that the the iteration\n[1:09:28] speed is is abysmal.\n[1:09:30] And\n[1:09:32] >> what is there alternative? Are there a\n[1:09:34] shell for that dagger?\n[1:09:36] >> Let's go back to PHP where we can just\n[1:09:39] make a change and it's reflected online\n[1:09:41] immediately.\n[1:09:42] >> Yeah. Let's let's put in secure FTP.\n[1:09:45] >> Well, the what is the solution? I don't\n[1:09:48] know. But like but like dude that's\n[1:09:50] another thing I could I could whine\n[1:09:51] about when I um\n[1:09:54] >> when I go to\n[1:09:55] >> see I do light\n[1:09:56] >> when when I go to a client basically all\n[1:09:58] the tests are tied up in the CI you\n[1:10:00] can't run them locally for some reason\n[1:10:02] >> that's nonsense that's impossible if\n[1:10:04] they work on a machine that is pre that\n[1:10:06] is configured by a script then you don't\n[1:10:08] run that script on your machine to make\n[1:10:10] it work come on\n[1:10:11] >> well the trouble is is that a lot of\n[1:10:12] these things are uh in isolated AWS\n[1:10:15] accounts for network isolations\n[1:10:18] reasons or something like that and then\n[1:10:19] you're effed and you can only run it in\n[1:10:21] a CI\n[1:10:22] >> and then it is blacksmith.sh message.\n[1:10:25] Sorry, I thought this this website was\n[1:10:26] not the right one and then Gemini\n[1:10:29] brought me back here. So, so basically\n[1:10:31] you're stuck in this GitHub action uh CF\n[1:10:35] guess nightmare where everything takes\n[1:10:38] at least 2 minutes. Even even like the\n[1:10:40] most basic workflow in the planet takes\n[1:10:43] a minute\n[1:10:45] >> and and it just gets worse from there.\n[1:10:47] And they're like, \"Oh, let's see if this\n[1:10:48] works. Let's wait 30 minutes. Let's see\n[1:10:51] if that works. So let's wait another 30\n[1:10:53] minutes. And that's that's that's the\n[1:10:56] problem. The iteration speed is just is\n[1:10:58] just anything over a minute is insane.\n[1:11:03] >> You have the same with cloud code now.\n[1:11:04] You ask it to do something and you have\n[1:11:06] to wait like two three minutes before.\n[1:11:08] >> Yeah. I I I did this I did this uh\n[1:11:12] kind of dumb but you you you will get\n[1:11:14] it. So basically I put an alias where\n[1:11:17] where where I go get diff uh pipe it\n[1:11:20] into claw to create me a a commit\n[1:11:22] message\n[1:11:23] >> because you know like when you do a get\n[1:11:24] commit message when you do a get commit\n[1:11:26] I\n[1:11:27] >> I didn't want to use my precious brain\n[1:11:29] cells to come up with a with a commit\n[1:11:31] log. I just wanted claw to do it. But\n[1:11:34] then I started using this alias to make\n[1:11:36] the g commits and it's so slow and I'm\n[1:11:38] like oh my god\n[1:11:40] >> so there's this one guy I don't remember\n[1:11:43] where I saw it but basically you can\n[1:11:45] hook up cloud to notify and what he does\n[1:11:49] is when cloud goes into a thinking loop\n[1:11:52] he unlocks social media uh Instagram\n[1:11:55] Facebook whatever YouTube and then the\n[1:11:57] moment that cloud finished thinking is\n[1:11:59] waiting for input it I don't remember\n[1:12:01] who did this but it was really funny it\n[1:12:03] basically sends the hook and it locks\n[1:12:05] everything. So all of his, you know,\n[1:12:06] YouTube, whatever, Facebook, Instagram,\n[1:12:08] all just suddenly, you know, gets\n[1:12:10] suspended and he's boom back into cloud.\n[1:12:14] I think that's a very funny thing\n[1:12:15] because he had then a video showing how\n[1:12:17] every time he kicks it off and boom,\n[1:12:18] he's watching videos all over his screen\n[1:12:20] and then 5 seconds later, boom, they all\n[1:12:22] go away and he's like back on cloud and\n[1:12:23] boom, all of the videos pop up again.\n[1:12:25] >> Oh my god. Well, this this is why people\n[1:12:29] run multiple instances of Claude, right?\n[1:12:31] because it, you know, one's blocking or\n[1:12:34] doing its thing and then you want to do\n[1:12:36] another one and then you want to do\n[1:12:37] another one and then you're like\n[1:12:38] >> I just don't have\n[1:12:39] >> you have three panes open on um on your\n[1:12:43] >> on Ghosty and you just and you're\n[1:12:45] waiting for a bell or something like\n[1:12:47] that.\n[1:12:49] >> 15 more days and then I think I have\n[1:12:52] eliminated enough subscriptions that I\n[1:12:54] think I'm going to bump from $20 to $100\n[1:12:57] on cloud cuz I'm tired of waiting. Um,\n[1:13:01] they've convinced me. I I I always said\n[1:13:03] like I I play bat on multiple horses. I\n[1:13:05] pay them the lowest subscription on each\n[1:13:08] and I switch between when I run out of\n[1:13:09] tokens.\n[1:13:09] >> Oh my god, you have your training. So So\n[1:13:12] basically, tell me about your your\n[1:13:14] waiting experience. I mean, do you have\n[1:13:16] a couple of terminals open? Like how\n[1:13:19] many how many sessions are you are you\n[1:13:22] have? I usually run them on different on\n[1:13:23] different repositories not on the same\n[1:13:25] like I have in this case now I'm I'm\n[1:13:27] doing this the the specification for for\n[1:13:30] the rename shoot then I'm doing the\n[1:13:31] provider\n[1:13:32] >> school I forgot\n[1:13:33] >> yes\n[1:13:34] >> okay you got to tell me you got to tell\n[1:13:36] me about your uh how many agents you're\n[1:13:38] running how many agents\n[1:13:40] >> okay see you Vincent good chat hopefully\n[1:13:42] everyone enjoyed that comments below\n[1:13:45] >> see you bye",

Do not mention or acknowledge them, and do not say you skipped or ignored anything. Avoid sponsor/ad/promo language, brand names like Squarespace, or CTA phrases like discount code. Treat them as if they do not exist. If a slide segment is purely sponsor/ad content, leave that slide marker with no text.\nWrite a detailed summary that captures the main points, supporting facts, and concrete numbers or quotes when present.\nUse the slide format below. Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 83,853 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line. Use straight quotation marks (no curly) as needed. If no suitable line exists, omit excerpts. Never include ad/sponsor/boilerplate excerpts and do not mention them.\nBase everything strictly on the provided content and never invent details.\nFinal check: remove any sponsor/ad references or mentions of skipping/ignoring content. Ensure excerpts (if any) are italicized and use only straight quotes.\nFinal check for slides: every [slide:N] must be immediately followed by a line that starts with \"## \". Remove any \"Title:\" or \"Slide\" label lines.\nYou are not given any quotes from people who shared this link.

It's 7:22 here in the UK\nand you're listening to the AI\ninfrastructure podcast.\nVincent should be joining me soon from\nVietnam and we chat about infrastructure\nbecause we're both infrastructure\nengineers and we both love AI. So, we\njust talk about AI too and what's\nhappening.\nTo get hold of us, uh, my email is\nhenry.fe.\nI'm on uh\nx.com kaihendry.\nThe website for the podcast is\ndebase.com/mpodcast.\nd a b- s.com/mpodcast.\nPlease like which comment\notherwise\nplease do enjoy the conversation.\n>> How are you? Can you hear me\n>> finally?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Sorry. How long have you been waiting?\n>> Oh, just a couple minutes. Just waking\nup slowly.\n>> 22. Yeah, you're earlier than usual\nright now. You were waiting 5 minutes.\n>> Um,\n>> do you have time to look at all the\nthings I added into the document?\n>> Yeah,\n>> I was just uh waking up study and wasn't\nHD.\nOkay, let's have a look at the document.\nWhoa,\nthere we have some. Can I share it on\nthe screen?\n>> Sure.\n>> Uh,\nI see Theo's beautiful face.\n>> Yeah, I guess if we're going to keep\nquoting him, we should give him some\ncredit, right?\n>> The fact is I I was like this morning\nwhen I woke up. Sorry.\n>> We're like the number one Theo fans.\nIt's like we talk about it.\n>> Yeah, we're we're now doing what is this\nformat where we just watch a video and\nreact to it.\n>> Yeah, we should react to Theo videos.\n>> I picked up a couple of things that I\nthought are so true. Uh what he said\nthat I've I feel the same way. Um and\nthen Primogen had me laughing out loud\nquite a few times related to the\nentropic move of blocking third party\naccess. to their um you know\nsubscription plans which was also very\nfunny.\n>> Yeah. Like on the on the news front I\nguess\num\nI guess I've been I've been watching\nthat Jeffrey Huntley. Oh no, I I can't\nremember his name. The guy the guy that\ninvented Ralph which\n>> is it the human layers the No, that's a\ndifferent dude. Okay.\n>> No. Um, yeah. If I look at my Oh, no.\nI'm sure I want to show my my history.\nIt's probably quite dark.\nIt's very dark. Oh. Oh my god. Warren's\nabs. Um, this guy.\n>> Yeah. Jeffrey Huntley. He he he's he's\nthe the guy behind Ralph and he uh has\nthese kind of weird videos where he\ntalks about\nRalph and what you need to know about\nagents, but he doesn't really ever get\nto the point or into the details of\nanything. It's kind of weird.\n>> He's using Starship on his terminal.\n>> Oh yeah, Starship. I've stopped using\nStarship, actually. Uh\num but the thing that bothers me about\nRalph is that I I don't quite understand\nhow it doesn't really give you a\nframework for generating the tasks. So,\n>> right. Yeah, I know.\n>> So, basically you're you're back at\nspecket looking back at specket or um\n>> or I guess you could just use plan to do\nit, but whatever.\n>> When I when we talked about it, I wasn't\nvery clear because I mentioned it's just\na loop and you just ask the agent to\nlike find more work and continue. But\none of the biggest uh differences is in\nin a traditional way that you use AI and\nyou know with the planning tool and the\nto-do you create a couple of sequential\ntasks and you complete them one by one.\nBut with Ralph, you delegate that uh\ntask generation. You don't tell it the\norder or maybe you um the whole idea is\nthat you're able to insert tasks in the\nmiddle. Like it's another pre um\npredefined sequence of steps. And that's\nsomething that we didn't cover. Like I\nsaw a video at that time that that went\ninto detail about like what why Ralph\nWigum is so good. Um because it um it\nfetches work. But but we already do that\nwith with Beats, right? And Gasttown is\nbasically doing like Ralph but at the\nparallel level.\n>> Yeah. It's funny how like I mean inside\nmy consultancy company which which I\nwon't name but I feel like you know they\ntalk about problems and I think like gez\njust use beads just use beads and you\nthis problem would be solved.\n>> Anyway,\n>> persistent man.\n>> So um yeah where do you want to start?\nDo you want to start at the bottom here?\n>> Well, maybe you need to go up a bit\nbecause if so, the first thing uh AI\nhandles coding humans think. Um, one of\nthe things that also this week was very,\nyou know, interesting in the in the\ninternet reaction. Of course, cloud uh\nwhat is it? co- code or co-work being\nannounced and and and basically the team\nBoris again saying we built in a week\nand a half using cloud code mostly um\nbring cloud code workflows. Yeah, of\ncourse we built it in a week and a half\num and and um it was all done by cloud\ncode. Um what was I going to say? I\nforgot. Anyway, the point was um and\nthere's another announcement related\nthat by the way uh the the people behind\ncursor built a browser in Rust. No, in\nRust. Yes, they built a browser with the\nfull rendering engine uh which is like 3\nmillion lines of code in a week and a\nhalf using an agent swarm and they go a\nlittle bit into details in how many\nagents they ran. And then people said,\n\"Yeah, you know, Firefox is like 31\nmillion lines of code.\" Uh but then we\ncan have a browser engine like like can\nyou imagine like WebKit or uh equivalent\nthat that can run the website. They say\nit works kind of works. We were\nsurprised it worked.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, there was a an AI generated HTTP\nHTML uh parser which basically took the\nHTML spec and produced a parser and I\nwas very impressed by that.\n>> Produced a regular expression you mean?\nUm, no. It looked like, hold on, let me\npick it up.\n>> It's a It's a very common like Stack\nOverflow question. You can't parse HTML\nwith regular expression. Let me repeat\nthat. You do not parse\n>> HTML. It's like a very famous Stack\nOverflow. And he repeated like 10 times.\nStop parsing HTML. I mean, this is this\nis old news. This is this is 2025 uh\nDecember. Okay. But there's this project\ncalled just HTML\nwhich completely generated by AI\nand it's basically yeah the cool thing\nabout yeah HTML 5 lib like Henry Civan\nand and friends has a whole bunch of\ntests so it passes all the tests so it's\nit's a brilliant thing because it has\nthe test framework obviously used it and\nuh\n>> it manages to to implement a whole\npassing library in like Um, I think the\nlines of code is Yeah. 3,000 lines of\ncode.\n>> Yeah. Well, this one from the cursor\nguys is three millions lines of code.\nUm, I think we're going to see this more\nand more now.\n>> People coming forward with like we built\nthis thing in a week and a half. It's\nmillions lines of code. It was a swarm\nof agents built it\n>> and\n>> it depends how well known it is, what\nthe testing suite is, I suppose. And\n>> yeah,\n>> but like for but like it's brilliant.\nFirst comment you're going to get is\nlike they're not re they're not\ninventing nothing new. It's no\ninnovation. It's just repeating what we\nhave. Like that's the common\n>> trope I guess.\n>> Yeah.\n>> But I I often when I mean I in the start\nof my career I actually worked on a web\nbrowser engine called webvm which and\nits innovation was to bring in device\nAPI so you could use you know GPS and\naccelerometer and things like this. So,\nI was working with\nbrowser engines. I was working with um\nthe W3C. I was in the mobile, I don't\nknow, task team or something. And I\nalways I always was a bit depressed\nthinking that like uh like WebKit is\nprobably the only browser engine in\ntown, but and and and the web is\nprobably doomed because of that fact.\nBut now with AI, we're not we're we're\nLike I guess we're this the lock in\nlevel has gone down right because like\n>> like I think we talked about it before\nbut like you know Jira like like oh you\ncan't implement another Jira\n>> there won't be any more SAS everyone can\nbuild their own SAS in in\n>> Exactly. It's amazing, isn't it? It's\nabsolutely amazing. I feel I feel\n>> it's a disruption.\n>> I feel liberated if anything, but u\nbut what you just said about\n>> I think I've just\nindependent. Yeah,\n>> but more specifically the rendering of\nHTML and Javas and execution of\nJavaScript and the DOM and all that,\nright? They are building um I knew like\nfor a while ago a zigg\nu based\nengine web like a browser but focused on\nLLM so to represent everything as text\nfor LLMs to browse. I I I came across it\na while ago and I thought\n>> but those sort of robots must exist.\nThey already been mean how else they're\npulling stuff off the web.\n>> Yeah. But that was like a public open\nsource effort from and apparently\nsomeone because I was interested in zig\nand then I came across like different\nframeworks in zig such as web servers\nand then I came across um somebody's\ncourse that\n>> coincidentally I used to work with that\nperson.\n>> Everyone wants to sell a course.\n>> No no no no this is this person I worked\nwith them and they they are very open\nsource minded and they built a course to\nreally you know it's fully open source.\nis not sold or anything like that but\nhe's also working uh as I was going\nthrough this course and then the profile\nI realized he was working on this\nbrowser and I thought that's really cool\nuh so he's very much working on on Zik\nand that's really cool but but back so\nthose browsers for LMS but now all not\nonly SAS but also complete foundational\ntools being rewritten and also brings us\nto the point of like Linux\n>> but that's mostly happening in Rust\nright I don't know why Zig is on the\nradar for you over Rust\nUh, bun is written in zigg. Bun is\nacquired by entropic.\n>> So,\n>> bun is the super fast. Zigg is like a\nmodern C like it even it has a a C\ncompiler that is much faster. So, you\ncan even compile um cross you can use a\nzig build system to cross-co compile um\nC libraries and into different towards\nto target different machine\narchitectures. So zig is even the zig\nbuilder is even used as a way to port um\n>> yeah go like go has that I'm pretty sure\nrust has that\n>> uh no go see go does not uh it still\nrelies you cannot like look at sql light\nyou cannot build or use sqlite with the\nseago um limitation this is actually\nlike c cross compilation so zig is\namazing there but anyway the point was\nthat teams coming forward building whole\nthings whole libraries other teams,\nother people because everyone says, \"Oh,\nyou know, LLMs, they don't produce good\ncode.\" But then Linux going forward\nsaying, \"I built this um audio\nvisualizer, uh a toy project.\" And um\nand this also is like brought up in Te's\nvideo where more and more people are\ncoming and saying like, \"I don't write\nthe code anymore.\" Um and and Taylor\nthen goes on in in in his video about\nlike why is it that senior engineers are\nmore like more used to or more\nacceptable to um to AI tools to LLM\ntools and then I saw some interesting\ncomments like yeah they're used to see\nand review other people's code like\njunior code so they know what code might\nlook like and the second thing that they\nhighlighted and if you put the document\non the screen you will\nis that um seniority is determined not\nby how much you code but by how well you\ncan orchestrate and delegate and those\nare management type of uh you know\ncapabilities. So as you are preparing\nyourself for a future of AI agents, you\nneed to move towards what they regularly\nattribute to staff engineers which are\nbetter at uh setting like delegation and\norchestration of workflows which is the\nreal differentiator between juniors or\nseniors and staff.\n>> Yeah. So I guess I I would agree with\nthat that uh\n>> observation.\nI mean at at work I just flippantly call\nit just writing things down. Like that's\nthe difference between a junior and a\nsenior. you write things down and uh\nyeah but that's a bit flippant but uh\nwhat what what is really needed is is\nabsolutely you know quality\nconcise\nuh documentation to get things done\n>> and a clear goal clear structure just\nclear thinking clear thinking is\nactually um I guess the number one\nskill to have right Because if you don't\nwrite clearly,\nyou're not going to get very far with AI\nas I feel. I mean,\n>> I disagree.\nI don't think I write very clearly. And\n>> okay, maybe maybe write clearly is not\nquite what I wanted to say. If you just\nif you just can't express yourself or\nsomething or express your ideas, it's\ngoing to be a struggle.\n>> A different angle as well. Um, so I've\nbeen doing speckit for what since around\nNovember or October and then with beats\naround November and what this has taught\nme I was not good at writing clear\nspecification documents and things like\nthat. Specit gave me a very good um\nexperience of like that's exactly what I\nneed right now. I mean I hadn't really\nhad the experience of working in\nenvironments where this was you know the\nthe common practice. So, I wasn't good\nat writing those documents, but when I\nsaw them,\n>> that's a good point.\n>> Yeah. When I saw them, I knew that\nthat's that's really good and that's\nwhat I like and and that's that was\nembedded within the prompts that\n>> So,\nso it sounds like the senior people like\nyou and I, senior seniors,\nthe the trick up a sleeve is that we\nknow what it what's good,\n>> not necessarily that we can produce\nwhat's good. In the meantime, this is\nwhat happens to my art my hyperland.\n>> Yeah, you've shown that to me before. It\ndoesn't happen to me actually. Got to\nyou got to get yourself the dual monitor\nor the GPU drivers that I need to\nupdate. I don't know. Yeah, that's Yeah,\nthat's that's interesting because yeah,\nI I take back what I said because\n>> because\nstuff that I've written and then when\nI've launched gone into plan mode and\nthen and then I've asked for for clar\nasked u claude for for clarity and uh\nwith ask question user tool. It's\nactually been an amazing experience.\n>> Exactly. Well, I agree with you that I\nthink the difference between senior and\njunior is that a senior, like you said,\nis going to write things down, maybe be\nflippant, but it's going to pause and\nplan ahead, which is like when you start\nwith cloud code, you you go into plan\nmode and you already get like a very\nfast feedback loop and you're like very\neager to jump into the code and to get\nit done.\n>> Uh, but once you go into more of spec\ndriven environment,\n>> then you really have to spend like I\ntold you at the start 80% and this is\nalso being repeated by many people\n>> some some water falling. No, I'm joking.\n>> Some some Yeah, you're right. Yeah, it\nis.\n>> You do a lot more upfront thinking about\nlike, you know, ultimately these these\nlarge language models are great at\nhallucinating, right? At at at thinking\noutside of the box. They have this\namount this massive, you know, I would\nsay library of words to choose from. And\nthey very easily pick between which\nwords, right? When you say something, I\ndon't like that word. Oh, how about\nthese other 10 words? Which one do you\nlike? They're all similar. And I was\nlike, \"Oh, yeah, that one is good.\" So,\nso they're very good at like um you\nknow, with words. Obviously, they're\nlarge language models, right? So, so\nthey're very good at that. And they are\nvery good at looking at a specification\nand then coming up with like what if\nwhat if this, what if that, what do you\ndo if the user doesn't have uh what if\nthe user doesn't have the credentials\nready? What if the the process fails\nmidway, you know? So, so it comes up in\nall of these cases. you know, you you\nset out your original, you know, goals\nthat you want to try and get and then it\nit builds like,\nyou know, the more context it built\naround the topic, the more it can, you\nknow, think about alternatives and it\nhelps you, you know, come up with these\nthings very quickly.\n>> So,\n>> and I'll give you\n>> Yeah, sorry.\n>> Yeah. I mean,\nI'm I'm just looking at the slide there\nthat you screenshotted with the\norchestration delegation clarity. I get\nI get orchestration. I think that's what\nwe've been talking about like\n>> what he he means with delegation is\nbreaking like complex problems down into\nsmall steps and then handing these off.\n>> AI does that for you.\n>> Uh maybe yeah but you need to know what\nif those are reasonable steps. You need\nto understand that this is the the path\nthat I want to go. You need to be you\nyou may also you need to still be\ncritical and think like wait a minute\nlike I've had several instances with\nLLMs that they go a certain way and I'm\nlike hold on a minute we're like we're\ngoing in a circle here like or we're\ngoing in a massive detour. Can't we just\n>> maybe I'm just I'm just being panted by\ndelegation. I guess delegation to me\nOkay, let's move on.\n>> There's a lot he he he gives a lot of\ncontext around this this this um\ndiagram, right? and and I I listened to\nit and then we should put the link in in\nour video because it's a it's a really\ngood one. Um\n>> but what I shared above that is kind of\nlike I I I read four or five things\nbefore I started work. Uh the first one\nwas uh with AI writing code is fast but\nyeah this is common that we we talked\nabout that right uh the Google team uh\nspending two years building a new I\ndon't know network routing or load\nbalancer system and then ultimately\nrebuilding it in a week well duh I mean\nit takes it takes weeks to\n>> actually I like your point in in the\nprevious podcast that like you never see\nthat cost you know captured like the\nfact that people have been thinking\nabout this for weeks if if months at\nadvance, but you you only you only see\nthe headline that it took a day to\nbuild. You don't see the fact that you\nknow all this human effort went into\nthinking and testing and coming up with\nthe idea in the first or the the details\nof the the plan in the first place or\nsomething or or all or all or all or all\nor all or all or all or all or all or\nall or all or the lessons learned\nrather. What what I I took away from\nlong time ago was if you want to be a\nsuccessful like at startup or founder or\ncreating something you must be very\ncritical of the world you must you must\nalso see like\n>> I don't like this there must be a better\nway and then come up with it like if you\nhave an inconvenience or or something\nthat bothers you and that's our role\nright once we have these we discover\nthese inconveniences and we think how\ncould we solve this differently that's\nkind of like\n>> I'm just going to write some I'm just\ngoing to write some of these things down\nOops. If I could just spell.\n>> I'll just carry on. Ignore me.\n>> Dictated. Dictated.\n>> I was just trying to\ncapture the things that I think are kind\nof working in my favor at least.\n>> Right. The next thing um was Greg\nMccluki's post. He's one of the creators\nof of uh you know within Google on on\nKubernetes. And the post started with\nthe very you know that when I started\nreading it I was like oh this is like\ncomplaining about Tailwind losing its\nbusiness and you know uh basically the\nerosion of of open source um no funnels\nno way like no new foundational\nlibraries being built the whole thing is\ncollapsing right because it was like\nopen source as a problem but his focus\nwas more like we create like things to\nwork on in our project and then people\ngenerate a massive amount of code and\nthey don't really care about the review\nprocess like is this good code or not\nand and he and and then I said like oh\nthis is complain about AI quality but\nthen he actually gave a very good\nconclusion so the at that time I think\nmost people stopped reading because all\nthe comments were like oh AI slop AI\nslop this AI slop that but the the real\ncrucial point or takeaway from his post\nwas at the bottom which is like we as\nengineers have to as leaders have to put\nin is you know teaching how we other\npeople can use the tools the AI tools\nhe's not saying don't use AI tools he's\nsaying we need to put in place the the\nthe framework for people to use the\ntools correctly so that what they\ncontribute and generate with with those\ntools is not slop but it is you know in\nalignment with our code qualities our\nverification our validation you know so\nif you are uh an open source repository\nuh maintainer put in place all of the\ntools like put in place uh speckit\nsome hooks.\n>> Exactly. Put in put in all of these\nthings that if somebody clones a repo\nand starts working on it and they open\ncloud, uh it immediately says, \"Hey, I\nsee this is um there's a couple of\nskills here that I can use to work and\ncontribute on this.\"\n>> So, so\n>> I thought that was a very good takeaway\nand half the comments in reply did not\ntotally miss that because that's you\nonly notice and know exactly what he's\ntalking about if you actually done these\nthings.\n>> Yeah. I mean, I'm so impressed with the\nDHH and Amachi because because I launch\nClaude inside inside Amachi and\nimmediately it picks up the skill.\n>> So immediately you have the AI aware\nenvironment for what you're trying to do\non your on your Linux distribution. Um I\nmean it should be lorded as a as a\npioneer in this respect, right? Because\nlike I don't\n>> and I'm doing the same thing.\n>> Okay, fine. Um maybe he's a pioneer\nbecause he has already done it. But I\nhadn't seen the the Omari skills, but I\nwas just saying the same thing. Um since\nwe made the public announcement of um\nreviving the project that was sunset by\nIBM um it's an open source project. I\njust integrated specket into it and I\nset up with a cloud skills for beats and\nI generated the first spec which is how\ndo we rename it like what\n>> what's what what what is the user story\nfor for\n>> is it the CD what con\n>> it's called CDK terrain now like CDK\nterraform uh terrain\n>> let's see if uh\n>> yeah that one well there is good so if\nyou look at the the latest pull request\nu the lot the the one that I just\nUm there is the RFC the rename.\nYeah. So so this one\nthis is all cloud code generated like\nthe purpose the user stories the\nfunction requirements\n>> the spec inside the github issue.\n>> No no no no the spec is on the branch.\nThis is just a summary of everything\nthat I committed in this particular\nthing. I ran\n>> I ran three commands uh which is I ran\nthe the specify to generate the the user\nstories spec ledger is my fork which is\nall my customization of specit cuz the\nguy who manages specit left Microsoft\nhe's now atropic he joined the labs team\nI believe\n>> oh my lord oh my lord\n>> yeah he was he was working on mcps like\nunder a lot of conferences at the end of\nthe year he wasn't doing anything on\nspecket anymore except for maybe merging\nsome like PRs. But so this is what I\nexpect like in terms of quality. And the\nfunny thing is I didn't really tell\nanyone but I shared it with some people\nand I wanted I was waiting and like oh\nis this AI slop actually maybe because\nthey didn't know they were like you are\nreally good at writing user stories and\nI'm like I didn't write any of those\nactually. I mean I spend a lot of time\nfine-tuning them and reviewing them and\nmaking sure they're aligned with what\nI'm trying to do.\n>> Where are the user stories here? Sorry.\n>> Under spec. So just above the cloud MD\non the left side. Yes.\n>> Yeah. Again go to the branch and look at\nthem. It's more logical. I mean\n>> yeah well that's faster. So user story\none like new new user bootstrap after\nit's been renamed and then you have\nacceptance scenario. Given a developer\nhas installed the CLI when they run the\ninit everything will work. You don't\nhave any dependency on the old. This is\ninteresting cuz this is one thing I have\na bone about your typical user stories\nis the acceptance scenario\num\ndoesn't\naddress the fact that some of these\nthings you know it's like\nokay this is probably just me moaning\nbut like a lot of cards that I pick up\nit's like okay uh if this new update is\nbeing done then uh you can now deploy\nthe new version of Airflow or something\nlike this, but there's no like like real\ntest other than manually\nverifying that something has been done.\nUm, and I'm wondering and just aloud\nhere,\nyou know, since I see this or something\nlike this, can like are your tests um do\nyour user story acceptance tests\nactually become tests is what I'm trying\nto say.\n>> That's that's what the whole idea of of\nKiru and AWS is, right? it's to turn\nthey put a lot of formal parsing and\nthey are forcing the LLMs within ko to\nwrite the acceptance criteria in a\nformat that they can formally parse and\ngenerate BDD uh behavioral\ndriven development right it it it\ndoesn't come back to you and say like oh\ntask done but uh you know I couldn't\nwrite I couldn't write a test for that\none or something like that or you know\nbecause that's what happens in in real\nlife is like a a developer comes back to\nme and says like, \"Yeah, I've done\nthis.\" Um, all I I have a screenshot to\nprove that it's done and I'm like,\n\"Okay.\" Um,\n>> how do I prevent regressions? No, I mean\nlike obviously I'm not working with\npeople anymore, so I don't trust\nanything the LLM says. It has to have a\ntest. Uh, the thing is it's going to\nwrite tests for everything, which is not\nalways good. Uh, but it does it does\nwrite.\n>> No trust for the AI.\n>> No, but that's one of the main things\nthat everyone is saying now, right? I\nmean our role is to to orchestrate and\ndefineation.\n>> I just I just think it's interesting in\na way just to sound out these\ndifferences\n>> at least for now. But if we go back to\nto like the narrative of Theo, which is\nultimately what I also feel because I\nnever wrote user stories this good\nbefore and I got the comment now this is\nreally good. You write really well. But\nI'm like I did write this anyway. Um but\n>> yeah going back to the\n>> Yeah.\npoint which is which he made at the end\nof it. Um because writing code is now\ntrivial, right? We can we can get\nsomeone something to do it for us. Um\nbut if you scroll down even people like\nLinuvaults who wrote the kernel and um\nyou know that they also say those people\ndon't even write code anymore, right?\nMost of the time they have an an idea\nand then they put it on the mailing list\nand someone picks it up and works on it\nand then they like it, they review it\nand they can merge it. But he said also,\nand this is exactly what I'm trying to\nsay, is you can become a good manager\nthis way because you pause, you create\nyour plans, you you you review, you do\nthat over and over and over again with\nAI agents. They're sometime going to\ndeliver what you want and they're\nsometimes going to fail miserably. And\nyou're going to learn that I had this\nstupid word in there and it tripped up\nthe AI and it started doing all this\nadditional stuff that I didn't want\nbecause of one or two words. stupid\nthings like error messages must be clear\nor that's obviously something you want.\n>> I mean, we're talking about a good\nmanager of of AI agents here because\nlike\n>> that's the future to be honest,\n>> but I'm I'm a little bit confused\nbecause, you know, I'm a I'm a I'm a\nmiddle manager as I mentioned before.\nThere's a few people that I work with.\nUm I'm a lead in a team.\nWhat does it mean for humans?\nSo, so what Theo was saying here, you\ncan become a good manager and the future\nwith AI adoption. The people that are\nthriving are the ones that, you know,\nhave learned that their time isn't best\nspent writing code. And I'm quoting Theo\nexactly because I wrote it down. Um,\nthey're they they know that their time\nisn't best spent writing code, but\nbetter spent thinking about\n>> Yeah. I mean, I'm just thinking aloud. I\nmean, I guess I got to get my colleagues\nto be managers, I suppose.\nYeah. Um\n>> they all need to come up to\nYeah. learn these skills.\n>> What's the other thing he said? Like the\nfuture depends on their ability to\nimprove around delegation and\norchestration, planning and strategic\nthinking, which is what I'm I have an an\ninterview tomorrow for like a staff\nengineer position. And um\nthese questions trip me up, you know,\nbecause every time I it's very I I use\nCH GBT. I said I have here's a JD the\njob description. Uh I gave my background\nof what I've done in the last five\nyears. So it of of course it starts\nglazing you saying yeah yeah yeah\nperfect you can do all of this. Yeah I\ndon't care trust it. Um and I said look\nwe're going to do practice interview\nright and it ask me these question and\nyou go into voice mode and it goes into\nthis very very it's it switches in\nanother mode. I'm sure I'm not making\nthis up. It go it switches in a special\ninterview mode that they built in\nChachiBT and it asks the question and\nthen it waits for your answer until you\nstop talking and then it gives you the\nfeedback. You went too deep on this.\n>> Yeah, it's amazing.\n>> You're using you're using JT advanced\nvoice mode or something.\n>> Yeah, I I used and play with it before,\nbut I I I thought you know\n>> I find it stutters back at me more than\noften.\n>> Your internet connection is pretty bad I\nthink.\n>> Oh no, no it isn't actually. Actually,\nthis this goes\n>> you're probably on like a more than\n>> on the topic of strategic thinking. I\nfor some reason I randomly watched this\nvideo yesterday and it it didn't have\nmany views and it looked like clickbait,\nbut since I was doom scrolling, I I\nwatched it anyway because it it was\ndifferent to all the I was\nwatching last night.\non on the topic of strategic thinking. I\nthink it's quite interesting because as\na as a consultant when when I when I\njoin a client, you know, they have a\nbunch of problems\nand usually since I'm in delivery and uh\nand usually since a client often doesn't\nreally have a good vision yet. I mean,\nwe we work on this problem, of course,\nbut but often I'm thrown into the the\ndeep end and uh we're just trying to\nsort out the delivery and then often\nthere's lots of tasks in the backlog and\nI just I end up basically saying yes to\na lot of these tasks. I will do them.\nI'll do them. I'll do them. And\nespecially now that I have AI on my\nback, I can do these things very very\nquickly. I can just pick up cards. And I\nguess in my in my in my my caveman mind,\nI'm thinking like, you know, my velocity\nis going to look insane. I'm going to\nlook great because I'm so much more\nproductive than um the other people on\nthis project. But it that's kind of\nstupid thinking after watching the video\nbecause because ultimately, you know, he\nwas pointing out that no one no one gets\nlike promoted or um by doing lots of\nwork. You know what I mean? Like that's\nnot how it works. You need strategic\nthinking. It's about saying it's by by\nshowing that you've prioritized some\nthings over another for a particular\nstrategic reason. Uh it's it's about\nsaying no. It's about it's about\nreaching a certain outcome. I mean, I do\ntry to reach an outcome when I'm in a\nclient project, but sometimes the the\noutcome or the customer is just opaque\nto me or um and I'm just doing the best\non the delivery front. I mean, that's\nthat's where I am in my career to be\nhonest. I'm in I'm in I'm in stone cold\ndelivery, but now but now stone cold\ndelivery is is somewhat solved by AI. I\nwant to move up in the food chain\nand I'm actually just asking myself how\ndo I get there?\n>> Yeah. So, Chachi gave those questions as\nwell in during my interview\nspecifically. How do you deal with\nshort-term priorities against long-term\ngoals? Um how do you deal with conflicts\nlike in terms of when you are um not\ncompletely agreeing with the direction\nsomething's going? So you know these\ntype of questions where I responded with\nlike examples of previous scenarios I\nhad been in and then it told me look the\nthings you did there and the way that\nyou work is clear communication setting\nresponsibility boundaries setting this\nand that. So\n>> uh so it's really focused on these um on\nthese um it's a good mock interview just\ntelling you and and also maybe it helps\nyou also clear form a better view. I\nthen practice with my family and every\ntime my son or my wife said something I\nsaid look I hear you but how about we\nare going\n>> until they got like nause annoyed by it\n>> you want to you want to drive to a\ncertain outcome and uh almost I mean\nmaybe I'm going to getting too adult by\nthe video that watch like you're almost\ngoing into politics now or something\nlike that because\n>> you're dealing politics\nBut the the the the advice I got from my\ndad who's been project like working for\nfor his whole life project manager or\ndirector and then he told me the most\nimportant is when you go for such\ninterview is because I was like I'm not\nprepared. I have all these things that I\nI I I stumble on these questions like\nall you have to do is pause and sound\nlike a reasonable human being. Make sure\nyou're well rested. Make sure you sound\nlike you uh you have logical thinking.\nNice.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And and and and and calm down just\n>> Yeah. The the let me tell you just a\nquick story like I was at I was in um a\nprivate Catholic school in South Africa\nand um there was lots of exams and I and\nsometimes I would just struggle and then\nthe uh the sort of uh the headmaster uh\nMr. a he said to me, \"Kai, did you get a\ngood night's sleep?\" And I said,\n\"Actually, no.\" I was kind of like\nthinking about this and working through\nthis. He says, \"Go to bed early,\n>> get a good rest.\" And then I I followed\nhis advice and I was like amazed how\nmuch I mean I don't know if if the\nresults were immediate but I can't\nreally remember but I was amazed how\nmuch how how less stress and how better\nthe exam went for me and I think the\nresults also reflected that and it was\njust it was just such a simple thing.\nThat's true. I mean, I have the same\nlike every time I'm stuck uh working\nlate trying to get something over uh you\nknow, done and you don't know when to\nstop. You just want to keep going and\nultimately you're too tired. You just go\nto sleep and then you spend an hour and\nwhen you wake up you wake up and you\nthink I could have done that in 5\nminutes because honestly I was just\nwrong at this point and I could have\njust figured it out way faster\n>> if I had a clear vision. If I had walked\naway a little bit and and thought about\nit. So\n>> yeah, I'm just I'm just worried that\nI've been doing things wrong for for so\nlong now because I guess I've just been\nin this crazy delivery mode where I\njust, you know, for me it's all been\nabout improving velocity, getting the CI\nworking, improving quality, build,\nbuild, build build.\n>> And AI is definitely making me reflect\non this all this stuff now.\n>> Yeah. And I think that's\nThat's why, you know, I'm doing that\ninterview more as a practice round\nbecause I'm not sure I'm going to get\nit. Although that with all the good\nadvice, maybe I'm able to surface more\nthe qualities that I I do have the um\nyou know, I have dealt with those\nsituations. But like like you said, I\nalso went like heads down harder work to\nget it done. Um which doesn't help in in\nin like a collaborative environment\nwhere we have to like communicate and\nand find out and know how we can meet\nthe targets and things like that. Right.\nSo, I don't expect to get it, but I do\nfeel like with AI, I've learned a lot\nmore about pausing, planning, and taking\non more of a higher um, you know, level\nor strategic thinking position. And I'm\ntrying to apply that in in this in this\nopen source thing that I'm doing based\non blue.\n>> I mean, like your your CDF CDK terrain\nor what was it called before? Uh,\n>> CDKF. Yeah, CDK.\n>> CDKF. Yeah. I mean, you're you're\nbecoming a credit a product owner and uh\nI mean, do you have\nI mean, hopefully you have some users\nthat you're getting some feedback from.\nAnd\n>> yeah,\n>> if that's happening, then you're you're\non a good path already. You're in a\nbetter place than I am. I mean, I\n>> don't know if you remember, I did used\nto have my own product uh webcon\nconverger.com\nand own business to go with it. I mean I\nwas I was earning money\n>> with it\n>> and uh and that was my life for a few\nyears and it was good times in a way but\nthe\nbut I guess since it was like one man\nband\n>> you could revive it now you have a\nfleet.\nYeah, I I don't think the, you know,\nthese kiosks that you see in libraries\nand things like that, I don't I mean,\nmaybe digital signage is still a thing.\n>> Um, but but the I'm not too sure the\nmarket is there for for that product. Um\n>> Mhm.\n>> I mean, but yeah, you're right. I could\nrevive it. I I should I should I need to\nbecome a product owner really. Uh just\nlike what you're trying to do. I mean or\nwhat you are doing.\nYou got Souk and you got Vincent. You\ngot\n>> It's my You got a few You got a few\npersonalities that I'm online.\n>> I didn't realize I was logged in under a\ndifferent account and I was like, \"Oh,\nwhatever. I don't care.\" I could have\ndeleted and do it again.\n>> Yeah. So, I wish you like I mean, we\nshould we should turn this podcast and\nlike how to have a successful business\na successful product owner. Um\nI I guess so this is still does this\nhave a business are you going to are you\ngoing to get people to pay for it\n>> somehow?\n>> No, absolutely not. This is open source.\n>> Oh god.\n>> How are you going to pay for the\n>> there are companies depending on this\n>> Vietnamese soups?\n>> I don't I don't know that's not on the\nprim that's okay. The first and foremost\nI do this because I want this tool. I\ndon't want it to die. I've I built terra\nconstructs because I'm tired of\nterapform modules and I don't want to\nwrite another line of terapform module\ncode in my life ever again. So well\nthat's too much. Of course if I'm look\nlooking for an opportunity and they are\non terapform modules I'm not going to\nforce them to use my library. Um I'm\njust going to keep telling them every\ntime I'm upset.\n>> Can I just relate? I had a I've been\ndebugging furiously the last two days a\nCDK issue at the client. it was the\ncircular dependency uh problem\n>> and I don't feel I would have hit that\nwith Terraform. I don't know do you have\nany opinions about circular\ndependencies?\nThere's so many companies when I come\ninto organizations that have rolled out\nTerraform without having any prior\nexperience into it and a common scenario\nis they they try to centralize um like\nthe classic thing about security for\nexample this module does all of the IM\nroles this module does all of the\nsecurity groups because this is like the\ncentral IT type of setup whereas uh\nyou're you're going vertical this\nproduct owns this security group this IM\nrole this belongs to that product it's\nlike vertical slice versus horizontal\nBut the trouble is that in this\nparticular client they've gone CDK\nacross the whole platform in like they\nhave a storage stack, a security stack,\na network stack.\n>> Yeah. So the storage stack gets a bit\nmad.\n>> So of course you're going to have\nvertical and and uh teams are going to\nown shared resources. So you must uh but\nusually the type of cycles you describe\nhappen in terapform similarly as in\ncloud formation which is you are\ncreating a security group over here and\nthen you are um you know creating the\nthing over there and then you need to\ncross references and they end up\ndepending of each other and now you have\nto deploy this first and then you have\nto apply that and then you have to\n>> I was just I guess I was just a bit\n>> I was just a little bit I thought maybe\nthe the ergonomics of the CDK developer\nexperience was not\ncuz I feel like with terraform when when\nI see dependency issues it's very clear\nbecause the way the way that this\nproblem\n>> this is not a CDK like please use the\nword AWS CDK when you talk about cloud\nform okay because\n>> because I do not use cloud form I use\nCDK for terraform and now CDK terrain\nwhere all everything you said about like\nCDK doesn't give me the clarity it's AWS\nCDK doesn't give you that\n>> yeah yeah the AWS CDK tool yeah yeah\nyou're right and okay god this is going\nto be difficult to talk about have to\nprefix everything with AWS. So the way\nthat this problem manifested itself with\nthe AWS CDK uh diff it it showed like\nall these IM changes\nand then an AWS CDK deploy\nbasically\nbailed out because of all these circular\nuh dependencies.\n>> Yeah, cloud formation can be very\npainful. Uh Terraform is going to tell\nyou that very quickly. It's going to say\nI cannot plan this because there's a\ncycle detected early. If you do it\nwithin Exactly. So, so I guess my my my\nmoan is about how diff and and and\ndeploy\n>> were like\n>> not really lining up very well. I mean,\n>> yeah,\n>> it confused a lot of people and then I\nthen as the most experienced person on\nthe project, I picked it up and I was\nlike banging my head for two days.\n>> Yeah. So, so the thing is that's exactly\nwhy I am doing what I'm doing which is I\nlove AWS CDK developer experience but I\ndo not like the things that you just\ndescribed which is problems with cloud\nform not uh you know the same\nflexibility in how I do my plan and diff\nbecause uh with cl with terapform you\nhave atlantis automation that you can\nuse you have so many tooling around it\nyou because with AWS CDK you are tied to\nthe cloud for runners of AWS and however\nthey make it available. It has pros\nbecause you don't have to deploy your\nrunners. You don't have to worry about\nthe state where you're going to store it\nbecause cloud form is taking care of all\nof it. It's all it's a full package\nsolution. It even does the full roll\nback. You can do it across regions. It's\namazing. But I do not like it. Terraform\nis is way more flexible. You control\nwhere you put your state. You control\nhow you do your runners. Do you do it in\nGitHub workflows? Do you do it with a\ndedicated instance? Do you use\nspacelift? You can choose everything you\nwant. So, so that's why I'm working on\nCDK terrain and that's why I'm working\non my library.\n>> On the topic of CDK, another thing that\nsort of blew my mind was that the the\nclient uh hadn't updated AW CDK uh\nlibrary for uh for for like two years.\nNo joke.\nand uh and that's something that I had\nto pick up\n>> and I picked it up and and when I looked\nat the change log um you know over a\nperiod of two years I was a little bit\nuh how do you say\nshocked at how many breaking changes\nthere were cuz because this is a a large\nlandscape I'm upgrading the CDK library\nacross and I'm like oh um you know\noh oh Oh\nAlmost every release there's a breaking\nchange.\n>> Terapform provider AWS from version 4 to\n5 to six have also breaking changes that\nyou want to upgrade the provider you\nhave to change the way that you write\nyour security group rules. Uh they need\nto be individual resources.\n>> I mean I don't remember this being the\nexperience in terraform. I mean I was I\nwas shocked. I was like, \"No, no, no.\nThis is not happening to me.\"\n>> Because the same the same happened.\n>> This is I mean I\n>> Is it the same in Terraform?\n>> I just told you. Yeah. Terraform\nprovider AWS version 4 versus\n>> Sorry, I thought you were talking about\num\n>> No.\n>> So this is the same this is the same\nproblem in terraform. Okay.\n>> Yeah. If you have a very old version of\nTerapform provider AWS version 4 and you\nneed to go to some feature that like\nsome for example SNS topic true is is a\nthing that was missing a property that\nwas added on the SNS service and it's\nonly available in in provider version\nv6. So you have to upgrade to version v6\nand there's quite a few breaking changes\nfrom 4 to 6. So you're going to and that\nwas even worse when you were in\nTerraform 0 0.12 to uh 0 before it was\nv1.\n>> You're right. You're right. You're\nright.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay. I guess I'm just looking at\nTerraform\nin with\nit.\n>> I think Terraform surfaces these issues.\nUm again, the problem with AWS CDK that\nI will agree with and that everyone\ntells me when I talk about it, it's the\nadditional complexity. This is this\naccidental complexity versus because now\nI mean imagine this. AWS has a team\nwithin AWS that builds a service SNS or\nIM team or another one, right? They\nbuild an API. These are all not\nidentical, right? We I think we talked\nabout this. You said that's weird\nbecause Jeff Bezos\ndictates that everything needs to go\nthrough an API, but SC was every team is\nbuilding their own API around their\nservices. So some like for example if\nyou use API gateway and you want to set\nuh a different integration method\nparameter you need to JSON patch it into\nlike a you know you need to send a JSON\npatch to modify the object there's no\nindividual like sub resources like what\nyou expect with REST things like that\nright different services different APIs\nnow from those services people wrote a\nTerraform provider manually right and\nthey're going to like abstract the\nconfiguration away they're going to take\nthe way that Jason Right. And then\n>> and for the most part they've done a\ngreat job but like it's yeah it's hard.\n>> Okay. And then you have these resources\nright that are basically kind of an\nabstraction on top of those APIs. And\nnow we are building another abstraction\non top of it which is like these L2\nconstructs which are basically wrapping\nthose APIs uh wrapping those resources\nwhich are wrapping those APIs which is\nlike\n>> how many layers in between are we here?\nLike this is ridiculous right? Yeah, we\ntalked about this before, but like I I I\nwas naive or or something cuz I always\nthought that that there was some sort of\ncommon I thought it was called Mason or\nsomething. Misison or\nAmazon.\n>> Yeah, we talked to we had\n>> Yeah. and and that was and that was\nsplitting out things and you pointed to\nthat project which was I think more akin\nto that but in reality people are using\nTerraform provider and this uh CDK\nlibrary and we're basically\n>> in this world of pain in a way because\nit's man dude like this month debug\nsession with all these breaking changes\nover a two-year library jump was\nyou know not fun.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Not fun. And and and to be honest, we\nhaven't deployed it into UAT yet. It's\nonly just in dev.\n>> And and the trouble is like I feel or\nmaybe I'm taking things too personally,\nbut like I do the work. I own the I own\nthis sort of migration,\nwhich is a result really of people not\nkeeping dependencies up to date. And\nthen any any feedback about things\nbreaking is going to come back to me.\nOh, Kai, it's it's your fault. Your\nfault. Your fault. Your fault. Your\nfault. Like\n>> so DevOps is the thank most thankless\njob, right? In like platform engineer.\n>> Yeah. And then there's no tests for all\nthese like I have like I have zero\nconfidence that that the test suite\nmanaged to capture any of these breaking\nchanges.\n>> That's the problem. That's the problem\nwith how the industry has approach\napproach the platform engineering. They\nthey still clinging to config files and\nand and and saying that yeah we can't\ntest the system. Like just a few days\nago, somebody uh from Terra team posted\nMalcolm posted um the thing people don't\nunderstand is that you cannot test your\ninfrastructure the same way that you\ntest your programs. And I'm like yes you\ncan. And he's like no you can't because\nwhen you do your network in production\nand you set up your security rules or\nyour networking rules there's no way for\nyou to test that. Only in production you\ncan validate that it works the way it\nshould. And I'm like, but I agree with\nthat. But there are things that you can\ntest in the middle. Like you can test\npatterns. You can build patterns.\n>> Have you heard this project? Have you\nheard of this project? I thought you\nmight have used it. Goss.\n>> I've seen it, but I don't remember.\n>> I think it's like um\nwait, it's like YAML driven\ninfrastructure testing like\n>> Oh,\n>> test for certain things. And\n>> I used\n>> I used RSpec once which is like Ruby on\nreal uh Ruby based uh service\nspecification testing.\n>> Yeah, man. I'm a bit depressed. I think\nthe next few days with this roll out and\neverything breaking around me, I'm going\nto get so much heat.\n>> Yeah. So, so you you you touched on two\npoints because you said first um you're\ndoing all the work and you're only\ngetting contacted about breakage. nobody\nappreciate the work that you're doing.\nAnd second, we talked about there are no\ntest.\n>> Well, I don't I'm not looking for\nappreciation. I'm just looking for like\n>> No, no, look, this is this is\n>> understanding about this this I mean\nlike this 2-year AWS CDK upgrade is is\nan absolute nightmare in a in a very in\na in a very I mean we're talking like\nlike\n>> and what are you doing double digit AWS\naccounts?\n>> What are you doing to prevent this from\nhappening again?\nbloody definitely going to update the uh\nthe py project toml every freaking\nrelease.\n>> No, but like what do you do to make sure\nthat that going forward every time a new\nAWS CDK version is released, every\nsingle um piece of infrastructure that\nuses AWS CDK gets a bump?\n>> Well, that's a good question. I mean we\nwe need a process where we we we do have\nincremental changes.\n>> Yeah. So there's two parts to the\nproblem here like there's I'm focusing\nI'm a platform engineer so I'm doing the\nI'm doing the platform up uh AW CDK\nlibrary upgrade\n>> that that's that's two years in the\nmaking\n>> but this utility library is also shared\nwith all the uh the data products in\nthis platform.\n>> So so basically the CDK is going to\nupdate for two years. So all the all the\num the data products depending on this\nlibrary have now got a 2-year bump in\ntheir CDK.\nUh thankfully most data products don't\nuse the CDK but some do.\nAnd of course like like Kinesis Fire\nHose went from alpha to stable. I mean\nevery anything that has kinesis in it. I\nI'm I'm I mean yeah I'm having to work\non my own platform but like sending PRs\nto product teams saying like um oh by\nthe way uh you probably need to update\nthis code here and this code here and\nthis code here\n>> and I mean I've even been doing PRs. I\nmean the workload is insane but like\nthankfully with AI it's trivial to to\nconjure up a PR uh when but but still\nit's it's an absolute nightmare. And\nthen\n>> okay but hold on can we just discuss\nthis one second because you keep saying\nbecause of CDK this we now have to do\nthat. I tell you I worked with Terraform\nmodules for 4 years in an organization\nwith 40 plus um done at the end of it 50\ndifferent AWS accounts and it's worse.\nGuess what? You need a custom uh you\nknow library and packaging system to\nactually put in place something like\ndependabot. you at least if you're on\nCDK you have dependabot you have you\nknow procedures to manage these version\nbumps because you have semantic uh\n>> there's dependabot for terraform by the\nway\n>> yeah custom made because it's so niche\nand dumb because it doesn't have a\nproper like like like versioning like\npackage managing system\n>> it's part of GitHub uh dependabot it's\n>> yeah because they have to build so I\nunderstand you have this dependabot\nsupports the golang ecosystem supports j\num javascript ecosystem supports Java,\nNVM, Maven, Nugat. So it knows all of\nthese registries. All of these have like\nproper semantics on on like you can\ndefine I accept up to this version and\nso bumps can be controlled all of that,\nright? But\n>> not ter\n>> only if you pay for the registry from\nHashi Corp.\nOh god,\n>> you cannot like\nmaybe dependable they they have added\nthe ability to define a version\nconstraint but in the past when you use\nterafform modules you can only put it on\nan S3 bucket or you put it in git tag\nand those and it does not comp um\nsupport um a query mechanism. So only if\nyou use hashi corp registry you can\nactually define a a version constraint\nthat says I accept all major like\nanything but not pass this major\nversion. So I accept all the minor\nbumps. I accept all the patch bumps and\nthis is a paint only feature which is\nridiculous.\n>> Yeah. But like to be honest the the I\ndon't know if you work like which line\nwhich language you work with in CDK\nbecause the Python upgrade story is not\ngreat in my opinion.\n>> Yeah. No, I I use TypeScript because if\nyou want to do a cross compilation, you\ncan only do it from TypeScript to the\nother languages. So if you are a\nproducer of packages, you must use\nTypeScript. If you're a consumer, you\ncan use Python, Golang, Java. You cannot\nproduce\n>> the NodeJS gang knows how to update uh\ntheir package or JSON.\n>> They've got but like the\n>> they have like 20 different ways of\nupdating your packages.\n>> Exactly. But in the Python world, um\nyeah, there's 20 different ways to\nupdating uh well, you know,\nrequirements.ext text your py project\ntunnel\n>> in language ecosystem at least the\nthings like Google but even golang is\nkind of a horrible mess\n>> go go get minus you is uh\n>> yeah but go packaging has been solved\nyears ago\n>> try to work with private and then uh you\nneed to you private go modules\n>> yeah so it's been a while you want what\nare you going to ask me like it's broken\noh god\n>> no you have like um you have to have\nlike a way to expose the the key towards\nit um like SSH but if you have like two\ndifferent um I remember it being a huge\nmess like very painful there are\nworkarounds but it's\n>> anyway yeah I agree with you languages\nnow have good story\n>> I I agree with you that that upgrading\ndependencies is the bane of my is is a\nvery common\nproblem in in our industry and and um\nyeah, I mean I'm just picking out the\npieces here, but like in future I want\nto get the platform to to increment\ndependency updates all the time.\n>> Yes, exactly. And there's an extra bonus\ncharge of getting data products.\n>> And there's there's there's a there's a\nculture I would say in especially in the\ndata product. This is not relating to my\ncurrent client, but I've seen it in\nother places like like when the data\nwhen the data engineers get their data\nproduct working in Airflow, they're\nlike, \"Don't touch it. It's working\nnow.\"\n>> And in the end, I have no idea how to\nvalidate it.\n>> And like, you know, I hate this data\nengineer because the these guys\noften\nThey get like they get treated like\nroyalty\n>> and then they get treated like a royalty\nand the platform engineers the people\nwho make it work are like yeah that\nplatform engineer has been blocking me\nanyway. Yeah,\n>> this is such a common data versus\nplatform\n>> and then once they get it working it's\nlike don't touch it ever\nand like dude you need to update it.\nIt's running a library that's been, you\nknow, vulnerable for two years now. And\noh my god, this is my life.\n>> But maybe AI can make it better. Maybe I\ncan uh do a surgical update and uh force\npeople to um test it.\n>> There's no is there no feedback loop or\nvalidation mechanism then AI is just\ngoing to make a bigger mess. But my\nfriend also just moved from being more\nof um you know consultant um customerf\nfacing towards uh he he was he he went\nfull stack and he was very excited to go\ninto devops and and platform because he\nloved setting up the networks and having\nthe control and then he worked\n>> setting up networks. How can you love\ndoing that? That's so\n>> And then if you haven't done it before\nit's fun. Uh and then he started working\nat a few companies and then he was like\nexactly what you just told me. He was so\ngetting so frustrated and I told them\nwelcome to this side of the fence where\nthe only thing you get is complaints but\nit's not always true. I have worked in\ncompanies where they do go the extra\nmile and say look the DevOps team really\ndid like went all the way here to help\nus this not not often but sometime do\nand I did also get appreciation for like\nfixing um you know like a big outage um\nthat helped. Oh, you fixed an outage\n>> and normally under my leadership there\nwon't be outage.\n>> Yeah. So, normally you get just like\neveryone on your back. But in this case,\nthey were like, \"What do you need?\" And\nokay, I trust you and when it's done,\nthank you so much. Like it's not often,\nbut\n>> you do get those.\n>> Yeah. I feel like I've I've messed up a\nbit here, especially with the CDK\nupgrade. I should have perhaps\na\ndoesn't doesn't help that uh when we we\nwe had an initial conversation about the\nCDK upgrade uh my colleague said, \"Oh, I\nthink we need two days to do this.\" And\nthen two days later it's like um I\nbasically picked it up and I'm like, \"Oh\ngod, we should have said we need we need\nweeks for this.\" I didn't realize it was\na 2-year\ngap year.\n>> Yeah.\nYou know, the reason why I was like\nhappy, this is a funny story to lighten\nup boot a little bit. I don't know if\nit's funny. I'm I'm going to try not not\nrant, but basically my job recently with\nthe CDK terrain is to migrate all of the\narchives repositories, mirror them, and\nget them building again, right? So the\nHashi Corp when they shut it down, they\nthey closed off a whole bunch of\nrepositories. The funny thing is all of\nthat is very automated, by the way. So\nclosing them was very fast, but\nreopening them is also very fast because\nI just need to run a couple of of\nworkflows. Like they have the original\nGitHub workflow that would deprecate\nthem and I just took that one and I have\nto like reactivate them. So it's like\ndispatch and it goes and does the thing.\nNow the biggest problem is mirroring git\nrepos that are like 6 GB. So the the\nteraphone provider AWS is a 6 GB git\nrepository when you try to download it\nand when you try to mirror it. Yeah. So\nmost of them are just like 2 GB. The\nbiggest one is is\n>> so 6 GB of\n>> git this the raw git data is 6 7 GB and\nthe Golang library is 7.7 GB.\n>> I don't understand how can a git\nrepository be that big\n>> I guess because of all the automation.\nSo this also brings me to the point that\nI told everyone we need the gar garbage\ncollection mechanism because there's\njust too much data in the because you\nknow it autogenerates a lot of code\nright it takes the terapform that sounds\nway bigger than the Linux distribution I\nmean the Linux uh git repository\n>> I keep hearing weird noises anyway so\nthe point I was making that I was happy\nabout is I was trying to do this m this\nI told cloud code working with opus come\nup with the plan on how to migrate and\nfork these repositories cuz reactivating\nthem is okay once they're there just\nthey need to be there. So I need to like\nG bear clone the repo then push mirror\nto the new. So clicking fork in GitHub\nties the repositories together and any\ncontributions are not attributed\n>> until they're merged. So if you have an\narchive repository and you fork it,\nthat's not good. You need to actually\ncreate a new repo and then clone and\npush mirror the the thing. Uh and and we\nwe built a script and it was working\ngreat for all of the repos I did until I\nhit this 7 GB one and it kept failing\nover and over and over and over.\n>> Linux is about seven.\n>> Yeah. So, so, so then the thing that\nthat that um\nthat was funny because I was going to\nsell tell a funny story is that today\nafter you know I was doing this on\nTuesday or or Monday and uh I finally\ngive up and said to everyone look um the\nAWS one is going to take a bit longer.\nThere's uh a 2 GB pack limit. So even if\nman even when I was chunking it and\nsending it in bits and pieces the pieces\nwere still too big. uh they were more\nthan two gigabyte and that's the limit\nthat you can send a pack. Um and then\nfinally because I ran out of cloud code\nI asked open codes to look into it which\nis uh JPT 5.2. I was using chach 5.2\ncodeex but everyone tells me.2\nyou quick question what's the difference\nbetween 5.2 and 5.2 codeex. I don't even\nunderstand anymore. I maybe Codex is\ntrained more carefully on tools use\nbecause I have to say codeex is pretty\ngood at tools but GPT 5.2 was uh\nconstantly failing to replace strings\nand things like that. So tool use u it\nspent 10 minutes 10 minutes it was uh\nlooking at\n>> using 5.2 codeex okay yeah\n>> no codeex was fast uh but today I\nswitched to 5.2 two. Um,\n>> oh my god,\n>> no codeex. And and it spent 10 minutes.\nSo I was like literally I forgot about\nit. I asked, \"Hey, look at this error\nmessages I get when I'm trying to do a\n>> I was working on something else.\" And I\nwent back to the tab and I was like,\n\"Hold on a minute. This thing is still\nrunning.\" Like open code is still\nrunning GPT for 10 minutes. I was like,\n\"What's going on?\" And and then it\nstopped after a while. No, it wasn't.\n>> What does What does What does open code\nsay when it's, you know, like Claude\nsays combobulating?\n>> Uh, I don't remember. But but um what\nafter a while it stopped and\nwhat's funny is one of the first thing\nit says you know I could just use the\nGitHub import functionality but the\nusers asking me to fix the you know the\nchunking and so on. I was like, \"Hold on\na minute. GitHub import functionality.\nWhat are you talking about?\"\nThat's funny how they like, you know,\nhow they go there. And and I'm like,\n\"What the hell?\" I worked on this for\ntwo days with Opus and it never even,\nyou know, suggested to use the GitHub\nimport function um feature. I don't know\nwhat this is, but if it sounds\n>> I think it I think it took 10 minutes\nactually to copy 6 GB uh repository but\nwhile I was talking with you I got a\nmessage saying um your import has\ncompleted. I was like oh yeah it's been\nstuck for two days. I would have liked\nto be able to do it myself like I I set\nup a 2x large runner in the US right\nnext to I hope one of the data centers\nof GitHub so that I can get the data\nlike it's going very fast but\n>> why don't you just pull it down into\nyour own good repo? I mean,\n>> yes. Yes. Sure. Sure. Kai\n>> selfhost.\n>> Yeah. Not of course.\n>> Oh my god. Am I bleeding? God,\n>> you you\n>> scratching myself.\n>> Um,\n>> anyway, that was the\n>> You got the You managed to fork it.\n>> Yes, the provider AWS is ready and now I\njust need to build it. I'm using Depot.\nUm I'm hoping that they will sponsor the\nproject because their runners are really\nfast. Uh much cheaper.\n>> Sorry. Pone. What's that?\n>> It's um it's a GitHub runner\n>> tool.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's like Docker Hub type thing or\nsomething or\n>> No, no, no.deaf. You know how in GitHub\nactions you can run your own runners and\nsome people set up like EC2 autoscalers\nto bring up the runners\n>> and then they recently had to change the\npricing policies so you get charged for\nyour own runners.\n>> Yes. And then GitHub changed the the\nrules saying that control plane also now\nis being charged. So all of these people\ngetting like a free lunch with with\nMicrosoft you know delegating jobs for\nfree and scheduling jobs everywhere. Um\nthey are now upset because like why do\nyou change it? But I think they reverted\nsome of the thing already. Uh anyway,\ndepot and then of course a whole\nbusiness was created of people providing\nrunners for you because the the margin\nuh between running an EC2 instance and\num the cost you pay for\n>> why would you have your own runner just\nfor speed\n>> um\n>> or privacy or something.\n>> Yeah, it could be that you want to run\nthe EC the GitHub runner inside your\nnetwork. So you want to run it inside\nyour VPC of this particular account. So\nit has access to different uh private in\nlike endpoints. For example, you have a\nnet uh I server to to trigger deploy.\n>> I had those networking\nsituations.\n>> Yeah. But just use\n>> so so why are you using them just\nbecause they it's just some extra beef\n>> or why you have\n>> so the providers the the terraform\nproviders are massive and to build them\nuh you need to set the node uh memory\nlimits and you need to in some cases run\nit on more than just uh two core was it\n2 GB or 4 GB default runner from GitHub.\nSo, this one's Hashi Corp is using eight\ncores and 32 GB memory machines. So, I'm\nusing and um they're giving me a 7-day\ntrial to and and it builds the providers\nsuper fast.\n>> What what what does GitHub give you? I\nthink you we talked about this before\nlike black isn't this like blacksmith\nGitHub, right?\n>> There's blacksmith, there's runs on\nthere's there's quite a few of them that\ndo the same thing. And like I said,\nthere's a whole uh ecosystem very\nsimilar to like there's a whole\necosystem.\n>> Does GitHub charge you more money if you\nif you basically specify a bigger runner\nor something? I don't know how it works.\n>> Yeah. So to to be able to even use\nbigger runners, you have to pay $5 per\nperson per se.\n>> How come is\n>> which is ridiculous.\n>> Is is there a web page talking about the\nrunners? I can't see the\n>> So I have on my repos on my other\norganization where I have nobody else\nbut me. I actually had someone else but\nI kicked them out because I have to pay\n$5 per seat to even run a bigger runner.\nAnd then I get charged on the runner\nminutes on top of that as well. So if\nyou are like five people working on an\nopen source project, you're already\npaying $20 plus all of the billable\nminutes that you get for those large\nrunners. It's it's insanely expensive.\nWhere if I use depot.dev, dev I get much\nfaster and much cheaper um runners.\nI hope they sponsor me. I mean the the\nproject, not me, but the the open source\nproject.\n>> Yeah, I mean there there was a thing on\nHacker News yesterday about how someone\nhates GitHub with a GitHub runners,\nGitHub actions with a passion. And it it\nall comes down to for me for me my\ninterpretation is that the the iteration\nspeed is is abysmal.\nAnd\n>> what is there alternative? Are there a\nshell for that dagger?\n>> Let's go back to PHP where we can just\nmake a change and it's reflected online\nimmediately.\n>> Yeah. Let's let's put in secure FTP.\n>> Well, the what is the solution? I don't\nknow. But like but like dude that's\nanother thing I could I could whine\nabout when I um\n>> when I go to\n>> see I do light\n>> when when I go to a client basically all\nthe tests are tied up in the CI you\ncan't run them locally for some reason\n>> that's nonsense that's impossible if\nthey work on a machine that is pre that\nis configured by a script then you don't\nrun that script on your machine to make\nit work come on\n>> well the trouble is is that a lot of\nthese things are uh in isolated AWS\naccounts for network isolations\nreasons or something like that and then\nyou're effed and you can only run it in\na CI\n>> and then it is blacksmith.sh message.\nSorry, I thought this this website was\nnot the right one and then Gemini\nbrought me back here. So, so basically\nyou're stuck in this GitHub action uh CF\nguess nightmare where everything takes\nat least 2 minutes. Even even like the\nmost basic workflow in the planet takes\na minute\n>> and and it just gets worse from there.\nAnd they're like, \"Oh, let's see if this\nworks. Let's wait 30 minutes. Let's see\nif that works. So let's wait another 30\nminutes. And that's that's that's the\nproblem. The iteration speed is just is\njust anything over a minute is insane.\n>> You have the same with cloud code now.\nYou ask it to do something and you have\nto wait like two three minutes before.\n>> Yeah. I I I did this I did this uh\nkind of dumb but you you you will get\nit. So basically I put an alias where\nwhere where I go get diff uh pipe it\ninto claw to create me a a commit\nmessage\n>> because you know like when you do a get\ncommit message when you do a get commit\nI\n>> I didn't want to use my precious brain\ncells to come up with a with a commit\nlog. I just wanted claw to do it. But\nthen I started using this alias to make\nthe g commits and it's so slow and I'm\nlike oh my god\n>> so there's this one guy I don't remember\nwhere I saw it but basically you can\nhook up cloud to notify and what he does\nis when cloud goes into a thinking loop\nhe unlocks social media uh Instagram\nFacebook whatever YouTube and then the\nmoment that cloud finished thinking is\nwaiting for input it I don't remember\nwho did this but it was really funny it\nbasically sends the hook and it locks\neverything. So all of his, you know,\nYouTube, whatever, Facebook, Instagram,\nall just suddenly, you know, gets\nsuspended and he's boom back into cloud.\nI think that's a very funny thing\nbecause he had then a video showing how\nevery time he kicks it off and boom,\nhe's watching videos all over his screen\nand then 5 seconds later, boom, they all\ngo away and he's like back on cloud and\nboom, all of the videos pop up again.\n>> Oh my god. Well, this this is why people\nrun multiple instances of Claude, right?\nbecause it, you know, one's blocking or\ndoing its thing and then you want to do\nanother one and then you want to do\nanother one and then you're like\n>> I just don't have\n>> you have three panes open on um on your\n>> on Ghosty and you just and you're\nwaiting for a bell or something like\nthat.\n>> 15 more days and then I think I have\neliminated enough subscriptions that I\nthink I'm going to bump from $20 to $100\non cloud cuz I'm tired of waiting. Um,\nthey've convinced me. I I I always said\nlike I I play bat on multiple horses. I\npay them the lowest subscription on each\nand I switch between when I run out of\ntokens.\n>> Oh my god, you have your training. So So\nbasically, tell me about your your\nwaiting experience. I mean, do you have\na couple of terminals open? Like how\nmany how many sessions are you are you\nhave? I usually run them on different on\ndifferent repositories not on the same\nlike I have in this case now I'm I'm\ndoing this the the specification for for\nthe rename shoot then I'm doing the\nprovider\n>> school I forgot\n>> yes\n>> okay you got to tell me you got to tell\nme about your uh how many agents you're\nrunning how many agents\n>> okay see you Vincent good chat hopefully\neveryone enjoyed that comments below\n>> see you bye\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–6:19]\nGood morning. It's 7:22 here in the UK and you're listening to the AI infrastructure podcast. Vincent should be joining me soon from Vietnam and we chat about infrastructure because we're both infrastructure engineers and we both love AI. So, we just talk about AI too and what's happening. To get hold of us, uh, my email is henry.fe. I'm on uh x.com kaihendry. The website for the podcast is debase.com/mpodcast. d a b- s.com/mpodcast. Please like which comment otherwise please do enjoy the conversation. >> How are you? Can you hear me >> finally? >> Yeah. >> Sorry. How long have you been waiting? >> Oh, just a couple minutes. Just waking up slowly. >> 22. Yeah, you're earlier than usual right now. You were waiting 5 minutes. >> Um, >> do you have time to look at all the things I added into the document? >> Yeah, >> I was just uh waking up study and wasn't HD. Okay, let's have a look at the document. Whoa, there we have some. Can I share it on the screen? >> Sure. >> Uh, I see Theo's beautiful face. >> Yeah, I guess if we're going to keep quoting him, we should give him some credit, right? >> The fact is I I was like this morning when I woke up. Sorry. >> We're like the number one Theo fans. It's like we talk about it. >> Yeah, we're we're now doing what is this format where we just watch a video and react to it. >> Yeah, we should react to Theo videos. >> I picked up a couple of things that I thought are so true. Uh what he said that I've I feel the same way. Um and then Primogen had me laughing out loud quite a few times related to the entropic move of blocking third party access. to their um you know subscription plans which was also very funny. >> Yeah. Like on the on the news front I guess um I guess I've been I've been watching that Jeffrey Huntley. Oh no, I I can't remember his name. The guy the guy that invented Ralph which >> is it the human layers the No, that's a different dude. Okay. >> No. Um, yeah. If I look at my Oh, no. I'm sure I want to show my my history. It's probably quite dark. It's very dark. Oh. Oh my god. Warren's abs. Um, this guy. >> Yeah. Jeffrey Huntley. He he he's he's the the guy behind Ralph and he uh has these kind of weird videos where he talks about Ralph and what you need to know about agents, but he doesn't really ever get to the point or into the details of anything. It's kind of weird. >> He's using Starship on his terminal. >> Oh yeah, Starship. I've stopped using Starship, actually. Uh um but the thing that bothers…\n\n[slide:2] [5:59–18:36]\ncursor built a browser in Rust. No, in Rust. Yes, they built a browser with the full rendering engine uh which is like 3 million lines of code in a week and a half using an agent swarm and they go a little bit into details in how many agents they ran. And then people said, \"Yeah, you know, Firefox is like 31 million lines of code.\" Uh but then we can have a browser engine like like can you imagine like WebKit or uh equivalent that that can run the website. They say it works kind of works. We were surprised it worked. >> Yeah. >> Oh, there was a an AI generated HTTP HTML uh parser which basically took the HTML spec and produced a parser and I was very impressed by that. >> Produced a regular expression you mean? Um, no. It looked like, hold on, let me pick it up. >> It's a It's a very common like Stack Overflow question. You can't parse HTML with regular expression. Let me repeat that. You do not parse >> HTML. It's like a very famous Stack Overflow. And he repeated like 10 times. Stop parsing HTML. I mean, this is this is old news. This is this is 2025 uh December. Okay. But there's this project called just HTML which completely generated by AI and it's basically yeah the cool thing about yeah HTML 5 lib like Henry Civan and and friends has a whole bunch of tests so it passes all the tests so it's it's a brilliant thing because it has the test framework obviously used it and uh >> it manages to to implement a whole passing library in like Um, I think the lines of code is Yeah. 3,000 lines of code. >> Yeah. Well, this one from the cursor guys is three millions lines of code. Um, I think we're going to see this more and more now. >> People coming forward with like we built this thing in a week and a half. It's millions lines of code. It was a swarm of agents built it >> and >> it depends how well known it is, what the testing suite is, I suppose. And >> yeah, >> but like for but like it's brilliant. First comment you're going to get is like they're not re they're not inventing nothing new. It's no innovation. It's just repeating what we have. Like that's the common >> trope I guess. >> Yeah. >> But I I often when I mean I in the start of my career I actually worked on a web browser engine called webvm which and its innovation was to bring in device API so you could use you know GPS and accelerometer and things like this. So, I was working with browser engines. I was working with um the W3C. I was in the mobile, I don't know, task team or something. And I…\n\n[slide:3] [18:16–30:54]\nyou may also you need to still be critical and think like wait a minute like I've had several instances with LLMs that they go a certain way and I'm like hold on a minute we're like we're going in a circle here like or we're going in a massive detour. Can't we just >> maybe I'm just I'm just being panted by delegation. I guess delegation to me Okay, let's move on. >> There's a lot he he he gives a lot of context around this this this um diagram, right? and and I I listened to it and then we should put the link in in our video because it's a it's a really good one. Um >> but what I shared above that is kind of like I I I read four or five things before I started work. Uh the first one was uh with AI writing code is fast but yeah this is common that we we talked about that right uh the Google team uh spending two years building a new I don't know network routing or load balancer system and then ultimately rebuilding it in a week well duh I mean it takes it takes weeks to >> actually I like your point in in the previous podcast that like you never see that cost you know captured like the fact that people have been thinking about this for weeks if if months at advance, but you you only you only see the headline that it took a day to build. You don't see the fact that you know all this human effort went into thinking and testing and coming up with the idea in the first or the the details of the the plan in the first place or something or or all or all or all or all or all or all or all or all or all or all or all or the lessons learned rather. What what I I took away from long time ago was if you want to be a successful like at startup or founder or creating something you must be very critical of the world you must you must also see like >> I don't like this there must be a better way and then come up with it like if you have an inconvenience or or something that bothers you and that's our role right once we have these we discover these inconveniences and we think how could we solve this differently that's kind of like >> I'm just going to write some I'm just going to write some of these things down Oops. If I could just spell. >> I'll just carry on. Ignore me. >> Dictated. Dictated. >> I was just trying to capture the things that I think are kind of working in my favor at least. >> Right. The next thing um was Greg Mccluki's post. He's one of the creators of of uh you know within Google on on Kubernetes. And the post started with the very you know that when…\n\n[slide:4] [30:34–43:12]\nperfect you can do all of this. Yeah I don't care trust it. Um and I said look we're going to do practice interview right and it ask me these question and you go into voice mode and it goes into this very very it's it switches in another mode. I'm sure I'm not making this up. It go it switches in a special interview mode that they built in ChachiBT and it asks the question and then it waits for your answer until you stop talking and then it gives you the feedback. You went too deep on this. >> Yeah, it's amazing. >> You're using you're using JT advanced voice mode or something. >> Yeah, I I used and play with it before, but I I I thought you know >> I find it stutters back at me more than often. >> Your internet connection is pretty bad I think. >> Oh no, no it isn't actually. Actually, this this goes >> you're probably on like a more than >> on the topic of strategic thinking. I for some reason I randomly watched this video yesterday and it it didn't have many views and it looked like clickbait, but since I was doom scrolling, I I watched it anyway because it it was different to all the I was watching last night. on on the topic of strategic thinking. I think it's quite interesting because as a as a consultant when when I when I join a client, you know, they have a bunch of problems and usually since I'm in delivery and uh and usually since a client often doesn't really have a good vision yet. I mean, we we work on this problem, of course, but but often I'm thrown into the the deep end and uh we're just trying to sort out the delivery and then often there's lots of tasks in the backlog and I just I end up basically saying yes to a lot of these tasks. I will do them. I'll do them. I'll do them. And especially now that I have AI on my back, I can do these things very very quickly. I can just pick up cards. And I guess in my in my in my my caveman mind, I'm thinking like, you know, my velocity is going to look insane. I'm going to look great because I'm so much more productive than um the other people on this project. But it that's kind of stupid thinking after watching the video because because ultimately, you know, he was pointing out that no one no one gets like promoted or um by doing lots of work. You know what I mean? Like that's not how it works. You need strategic thinking. It's about saying it's by by showing that you've prioritized some things over another for a particular strategic reason. Uh it's it's about saying no. It's about it's about…\n\n[slide:5] [42:51–55:29]\nto be difficult to talk about have to prefix everything with AWS. So the way that this problem manifested itself with the AWS CDK uh diff it it showed like all these IM changes and then an AWS CDK deploy basically bailed out because of all these circular uh dependencies. >> Yeah, cloud formation can be very painful. Uh Terraform is going to tell you that very quickly. It's going to say I cannot plan this because there's a cycle detected early. If you do it within Exactly. So, so I guess my my my moan is about how diff and and and deploy >> were like >> not really lining up very well. I mean, >> yeah, >> it confused a lot of people and then I then as the most experienced person on the project, I picked it up and I was like banging my head for two days. >> Yeah. So, so the thing is that's exactly why I am doing what I'm doing which is I love AWS CDK developer experience but I do not like the things that you just described which is problems with cloud form not uh you know the same flexibility in how I do my plan and diff because uh with cl with terapform you have atlantis automation that you can use you have so many tooling around it you because with AWS CDK you are tied to the cloud for runners of AWS and however they make it available. It has pros because you don't have to deploy your runners. You don't have to worry about the state where you're going to store it because cloud form is taking care of all of it. It's all it's a full package solution. It even does the full roll back. You can do it across regions. It's amazing. But I do not like it. Terraform is is way more flexible. You control where you put your state. You control how you do your runners. Do you do it in GitHub workflows? Do you do it with a dedicated instance? Do you use spacelift? You can choose everything you want. So, so that's why I'm working on CDK terrain and that's why I'm working on my library. >> On the topic of CDK, another thing that sort of blew my mind was that the the client uh hadn't updated AW CDK uh library for uh for for like two years. No joke. and uh and that's something that I had to pick up >> and I picked it up and and when I looked at the change log um you know over a period of two years I was a little bit uh how do you say shocked at how many breaking changes there were cuz because this is a a large landscape I'm upgrading the CDK library across and I'm like oh um you know oh oh Oh Almost every release there's a breaking change. >> Terapform provider AWS from…\n\n[slide:6] [55:09–01:02:08]\nthis is a paint only feature which is ridiculous. >> Yeah. But like to be honest the the I don't know if you work like which line which language you work with in CDK because the Python upgrade story is not great in my opinion. >> Yeah. No, I I use TypeScript because if you want to do a cross compilation, you can only do it from TypeScript to the other languages. So if you are a producer of packages, you must use TypeScript. If you're a consumer, you can use Python, Golang, Java. You cannot produce >> the NodeJS gang knows how to update uh their package or JSON. >> They've got but like the >> they have like 20 different ways of updating your packages. >> Exactly. But in the Python world, um yeah, there's 20 different ways to updating uh well, you know, requirements.ext text your py project tunnel >> in language ecosystem at least the things like Google but even golang is kind of a horrible mess >> go go get minus you is uh >> yeah but go packaging has been solved years ago >> try to work with private and then uh you need to you private go modules >> yeah so it's been a while you want what are you going to ask me like it's broken oh god >> no you have like um you have to have like a way to expose the the key towards it um like SSH but if you have like two different um I remember it being a huge mess like very painful there are workarounds but it's >> anyway yeah I agree with you languages now have good story >> I I agree with you that that upgrading dependencies is the bane of my is is a very common problem in in our industry and and um yeah, I mean I'm just picking out the pieces here, but like in future I want to get the platform to to increment dependency updates all the time. >> Yes, exactly. And there's an extra bonus charge of getting data products. >> And there's there's there's a there's a culture I would say in especially in the data product. This is not relating to my current client, but I've seen it in other places like like when the data when the data engineers get their data product working in Airflow, they're like, \"Don't touch it. It's working now.\" >> And in the end, I have no idea how to validate it. >> And like, you know, I hate this data engineer because the these guys often They get like they get treated like royalty >> and then they get treated like a royalty and the platform engineers the people who make it work are like yeah that platform…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "Kai Hendry and Vincent discuss the evolving landscape of AI infrastructure engineering, focusing on how large language models (LLMs) are shifting the definition of seniority from manual coding to orchestration and strategic thinking. They explore recent industry milestones, such as the rapid development of complex software using agent swarms, and contrast the developer experiences of various infrastructure-as-code tools. The conversation highlights the friction between rapid AI-assisted delivery and the long-term maintenance of platform dependencies, offering a perspective on how engineers must adapt to remain effective as \"managers\" of AI agents.\n\n[slide:1]\n## Agentic workflows and task delegation\nThe discussion begins with a critique of current AI agent frameworks like Ralph, which aim to move beyond simple sequential task completion. Unlike traditional planning tools where a human defines a set of steps for an AI to follow, agentic frameworks focus on delegating the generation of the tasks themselves. This allows agents to fetch work, insert new tasks dynamically, and operate in parallel loops. The hosts note that while this approach is powerful, it requires a shift in how engineers interact with tools, moving away from micro-managing code toward managing the \"loop\" of work. They also touch on the recent trend of \"reaction\" content in the developer community, specifically regarding how major AI labs are beginning to restrict third-party access to their subscription plans, forcing a more direct relationship between developers and model providers.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Rapid development and browser engines\nA major theme is the unprecedented speed of development enabled by AI agent swarms. The team behind the Cursor editor recently built a browser engine in Rust, totaling approximately 3 million lines of code, in just one and a half weeks. While this is significantly smaller than the 31 million lines in Firefox, the fact that it functions as a rendering engine demonstrates the disruptive potential of AI. Similarly, an AI-generated HTML parser was created by feeding the HTML specification into a model, resulting in 3,000 lines of code that passed all standard test suites. This capability suggests that traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) models, like Jira, may face disruption as it becomes trivial for small teams or individuals to generate custom, complex applications from scratch. *Seniority is determined not by how much you code but by how well you can orchestrate and delegate.*\n\n[slide:3]\n## Maintaining quality in the AI era\nThe hosts address the concern of \"AI slop\"—low-quality, high-volume code generated without proper oversight. They reference insights from Google engineers regarding the erosion of open-source quality when contributors use AI without a rigorous review process. However, the conclusion is not to avoid AI, but to implement better frameworks for its use. Tools like Speckit and specific GitHub hooks can provide the necessary structure for AI-assisted contributions, ensuring they align with existing code quality and validation standards. They highlight a case where a Google team spent two years building a network routing system, only for it to be rebuilt in a week using modern AI tools. This underscores the reality that while the \"headline\" delivery time is short, the underlying human effort in thinking, testing, and planning remains the most valuable component of the process.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Strategic thinking and career growth\nAs AI makes the act of writing code trivial, the value of an engineer shifts toward strategic thinking and the ability to say \"no.\" Kai reflects on the trap of \"delivery mode,\" where an engineer focuses solely on increasing velocity and clearing backlogs. True career advancement, especially into staff engineer roles, requires prioritizing outcomes over output. They discuss using ChatGPT's advanced voice mode for mock interviews to practice these high-level skills, such as handling conflicts between short-term priorities and long-term goals. *The future depends on their ability to improve around delegation and orchestration, planning and strategic thinking.* The hosts emphasize that being a \"good manager\" of AI agents involves pausing to plan, being critical of the AI's path, and ensuring that the final product meets a logical, human-centric goal rather than just being a collection of generated features.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Infrastructure as Code challenges\nThe technical deep dive compares AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and Terraform. Kai shares a recent \"nightmare\" experience involving a two-year gap in AWS CDK library updates, which led to numerous breaking changes and circular dependency issues. While AWS CDK offers a high-level developer experience, it is tied to CloudFormation, which can be opaque when debugging deployment failures. In contrast, Terraform provides more flexibility in state management and runner configuration, often detecting dependency cycles during the planning phase rather than mid-deployment. The discussion highlights the \"accidental complexity\" of modern infrastructure, where multiple layers of abstraction—from service APIs to Terraform providers to L2 constructs—can create a \"world of pain\" for platform engineers who must maintain these systems over time.\n\n[slide:6]\n## The friction of platform engineering\nThe final segment explores the thankless nature of platform engineering and the difficulties of dependency management across different language ecosystems. While TypeScript and Go have relatively mature packaging stories, the Python ecosystem remains fragmented with multiple ways to handle project requirements. The hosts discuss the cultural divide between data engineers, who often resist updates to working systems, and platform engineers, who must enforce security and library upgrades. They also examine the cost and speed of CI/CD, noting that GitHub's default runners are often too slow for massive builds like Terraform providers. This has led to a market for specialized runners like Depot.dev and Blacksmith.sh, which offer higher performance at a lower cost. The conversation ends with a look at the future of the \"DevOps\" role, which is increasingly focused on surgical updates and maintaining the feedback loops that keep AI-generated code from becoming a liability."
