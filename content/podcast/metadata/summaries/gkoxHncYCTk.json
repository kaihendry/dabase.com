    "content": "Transcript:\nto uh the value add on Terraform.\nAs by means of introduction, Vincent and\nI are seasoned infrastructure engineers\nand the following is a conversation\nwhere we talk about Terraform CDK\ninfrastructurees code and I think it's\nthe best conversation I've ever had\nabout platform teams. It's a bit of a\nslow burn. I hope you enjoy it. like the\nvideo. Um, and I recommend listening\nthis to this in in a car. You don't need\nto look at the screen. I I did capture\nan angle of me from the side, which I\nthink is a bit unflattering. Uh, so you\ndon't need to watch this. We we do try\nshare the the screen and browse to the\nthings that we talk about, but\nessentially I feel this is a podcast\nformat. You don't need to watch the\nvideo, but the video helps. Do please\nenjoy and comment below.\n>> See you.\n>> Why did I rebuild it? I probably didn't\neven need to rebuild it. Okay, so the\nvalue on top of Terapform. Um last time\nwe talked about a lot of drama around\nthe cloud providers and the way that you\nmanage Terraform state and the resource\nunder um under management pricing that's\nexuberant and then some drama around\nsome open source projects and I'm very\nexcited about them because I have my own\nopen source project which is focused on\nstrongly typed terraform right um\noriginally terraform\n>> I mean just to interrupt you I mean like\nterraform is pretty typed I mean you\nhave your strings, you have your default\nvalues, you have your\n>> strings,\n>> strings for enum values.\n>> Uh, okay. You have strings, strings,\nstrings. No, you have um I'm sure you\nhave integers. I'm I'm sure.\n>> No, no, but the problem is\n>> you have reg x you have uh you have\nstuff, right?\n>> Yeah. So, Terraform basically\nis built on the concept of plugins or\nproviders for a for clouds and cloud or\nfor pro for SAS or whatever services\ncloud services that give you an API\nwhere you can create resources such as\nAWS creates gives you an EC2 API where\nyou can create an EC2 uh resource,\nright? And that was very good and well\num you know 10 years ago where you just\nneeded to create a VPC couple of subnets\nan instance or an autoscaling group and\nthe number of knobs and dials that you\ncould configure were not that much but\nthen you start to having like life cycle\nhoots on autoscaling groups that works\nwith lambdas and you have SNS topics and\nyou have a lot of different services and\ndifferent integration patterns between\nthem right the cloud became way more\ncomplex uh a lot more serverless is now\nbeing part of a lot of the tech stack\nAnd Terraform is originally just a\nconfig file and a lot of programmatic\nfeatures were completely omitted. So\nthey tried to keep it dumb. They tried\nto keep it as simple as possible to\navoid people shooting themselves in the\nfoot. Most of the time when you talk to\npeople about using actual programming\nactual programming language for for um\ncloud configuration, they say like that\nis a mistake. Like um what are you doing\nthat requires a programming language?\nyou should stick to the the proven path\n>> like a more declarative style of uh\n>> yeah declarative way of of doing things.\nBut then they introduce for each. Then\nthey introduce list comprehensions. Then\nthey introduce local blocks. And then\nyou look at the Terraform AWS community\nmodule that has like 45 different\nvariables for input and and like five of\nthem need to be set in a specific way to\nthat trickles down through different\nlocal blocks with different tertiary\nconditionals that then need to value\nlike that go down ultimately in one\nresource configuration and then you\ndon't even know how those variables\ninteract. Speaking speaking of\ncomplexity, I mean I always thought\nserverless was a godsend because it's\ngoing to uh simplify\nuh deployment of um of uh of application\ncode, simplify the you know the life\ncycle, simplify\nuh everything to do with with that sort\nof stuff. For some reason um in\nTerraform at least provisioning a lambda\nis just a nightmarish uh I wonder why\nlike why is that? How come Terraform\nnever managed to make lambda versioning\nsimple\n>> because Terraform's\nprovider is built on the bare minimum\nresources to cover the API. So you go\ninto very granular level to you know to\nto set up a lambda you must configure\nthe lambda permission resource you must\nconfigure the IM role you must couple it\nand bind it to the lambda\n>> so there was no good uh there was no\ngood abstraction or something um\n>> so the the abstraction in terraform is a\nterapform module which is very limited\nin the way that you can configure it. It\nprovides a fat set of variable inputs\nand it provides some outputs and there's\nno guarantee around the type system of\nthe output at all. Like the outputs are\nany they can be maps, they can be lists,\nthey can be strings, they change if you\ndepending on the internal of the module.\nIf you decide to put a count inside the\nresource and then you use those outputs\nuh or those attributes in an output,\nthen suddenly those outputs become a\nlist and you know for some reason\nbecause under the hood something\nchanged, right? Yeah, that's inherent to\nhow terrible modules are developed.\n>> Actually, I mean my usage of of of\nserverless is generally quite\n>> what what do you call it? uh\nstandardized\n>> you know I usually just run a go binary\nbut I guess that's the trouble with\nserverless is that you can do you can\nyou can do a lot with serverless you can\nintegrate it in lots of different ways\nright\n>> well so the great thing about serverless\nis that you you're able to configure\nvery expressive business logic across\ncloud resources but that's also\nimmediately why it becomes so complex\nright because now your business logic is\nspread across your serverless components\nand if you work with something like\nTerraform, those components are very\nlow-level resources that all need to be\nconfigured exactly right for your actual\nbusiness logic to work.\n>> I mean I mean\n>> think about like a simple lambda\nchaining setup where you have lambda.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I I want to definitely get away\nfrom that because my my usage of of of\nserverless and is to is to essentially\nrun my monolithic application.\nLike for me serverless is like a way\nbetter uh ECS\nBut of course that doesn't work. I guess\nthat is the crux of the problem with\nwith lambda because yeah you can get\nchaining, you can get uh distributed\nsystems, you can get microservices,\nyou can get all sorts of things with\nlambda and then of course the complexity\nexplodes.\n>> That's right. And the complexity\nexplodes not only just because of how\nyour business logic gets like trickled\ndown across all of your cloud resources\num but also because of how these cloud\nresources are spread across different\nservices of the cloud provider. For\nexample in AWS you have a cloudatch\nservice you have a uh where you define\nyour logging groups and then your\npermissions of your lambda must be\nconfigured to write to those logging\ngroups. So that's an integration between\ntwo different services. you have your S3\nbucket where you have to have your\nlambda notification like settings done\nor you use event bridge where you have\nto have like event bridge rules that\nthen need to be capturing the right\nevent fields that you want to propagate\ntowards the lambdas. So the main problem\nis the integration across the different\nservices and you know how to bind them\ntogether and that's where AWS does like\nsolves it really well\n>> but lambda and cloudatch should be a uh\nwhat do you call it a fixed pattern or\nsomething like that\n>> it changes a lot and and and it's funny\nbecause sometimes\nit could be very simple like you have a\nsituation where you want a lambda to be\ntriggered on an event bridge rule and\nyou can simply go to the lambda and say\nasync config and then say on success and\nthen it will you know trigger another\nlambda or something else right and if\nyou do a very simple like lambda\nchaining and you can do that directly on\nthe lambda resource it works until you\nhave a use case and that's a very fixed\npattern but then you have a use case\nwhere now when the lambda success\nhappens you want to extract some field\nfrom the um success event like you need\nto get the actual um I don't know result\nfield from the ext JSON of that success\nevent and you want to get the extract\nthe payload like extract a certain\npayload then suddenly you can't do that\nwith async evoke that's not possible\nwith the way that the the lambda API\nworks and you must use event bridge\nrules so you're very use like very\nsimple pattern of like integrating two\nthings together which should always be\nthe same thing no longer works because\nnow you have an event bridge rules that\nlike match messes up your whole like\nsituation because you need to parse the\npayload of the event and get out one\nfield. And that's an example that I\nlearned because I wrote a library to to\nimplement um these integration patterns\nfrom AWS CDK on top of Terraform. And so\nI saw that like this is very this is an\nintegration test actually that they have\non their Lambda function integration. Um\n>> okay. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So\n>> I can show you the the actual running\ncode for that.\n>> Okay. So so you're just showing some\nLambda REST API. That's actually quite\ninteresting because uh we we we use that\na lot at work.\n>> Yeah. So so that's where the reality of\nthe cloud today is that people are using\nthese type of patterns more and more and\nand that's also because you want to you\nknow leverage the cloud to accelerate\nyour business feature delivery. So you\ncan't be like completely decoupled from\nthe cloud. You start to be really\ningrained and integrated with the cloud\nfeatures. Even though a lot of original\ncloud adoption was like we want to be\ncloud agnostic, Kubernetes is great. The\nreality is even if you use Kubernetes,\nyou're going to have a whole bunch of\ncustom resources just for AWS um to use\nto to to integrate with the cloud that\nyou run. at at work we we love to use\nthe lambda rest API because because it\nintegrates with IM and then IM is the\nway that we uh uh mediate govern uh\ndifferent APIs between different uh\nteams and stuff and a lot of the things\nin AWS is like the benefits is that\ntight integration between services right\nbecause like you just said IM is is a is\na really nice way to control permissions\nacross all of across all of for\nresources. Um, and so yeah, but I I\npulled this up because this is kind of a\nnice example and this is a great example\nfrom originally when they released the\nAWS CDK workshop um in how it simplifies\nlike try to imagine how you would do\nthis with terapform modules. You're\ncreating a function,\n>> right? And and you're specifying here is\nsomething very special already which is\nthe from asset. So this is actually\ngoing to\n>> this is a whole asset pipeline built in\nright in there. It's going to take care\nof bundling the code, you know, putting\nit in S3, making sure that the lambda\ncan pick it up or you can, you know,\ndirectly put the code in line. That's\nsomething that you cannot imagine how to\nbuild this with Terraform modules,\nright? I mean, I know that there's an\nattempt serverless.tf\nto do this, but I mean, it's just it's\njust a mistake and I'm sorry because I\nknow the people behind this uh and I try\nto to to explain that, but yeah, they\nhave, you know, this their projects at\nPET. So uh so anyway yeah so this whole\nthis one line already is an asset\npipeline and then this one right here\nthe lambda rest API is a special rest\nAPI so this is object-oriented\nprogramming and it's it's like an\nextension it's just not a rest API it's\na lambda rest API that understands the\nconcept of a handler that is backed by a\nfunction so this handler must implement\nthe function interface and then it knows\nhow to bind and automatically create the\nthe API gateway integration and back end\nlender call right\n>> yeah So, so, so just these lines\nalready. Um,\n>> and you get all the LSP, you know, what\ndo you call it? Checking to make sure\nthat everything's there.\n>> So, because this is an actual\nprogramming language with enums and and\nTypeScript is specifically built to add\ntyping on top of a non-type language\nlike JavaScript. So, it has a lot of\nfunctionality to to inspect the type\nschema and to to really be strong around\nyour typing. So you do get like indeed\nlike the from asset then it will the\nhandler with the I function and it's\nstrongly typed right.\n>> Okay. So I I'm I think I know where\nyou're going with this. So you're not\ntalking just about primitive typing.\nYou're talking about like fun function\ntyping and such and so forth. I'm not\nsure if that's the right terminology.\n>> I'm also not sure about the terminology.\nBut what I'm trying to say is that if\nyou have the telephone provider you're\ngoing to have a string. You say it's\nvery strongly typed, but yeah,\n>> string has only like three possible\nvalues. And when I'm building my\nlibrary, I'm actually have to go to the\nEC2 or the Alumba um you know API docs\nto figure out what are the valid values\nbecause that's nowhere in Terraform,\n>> right? And and they they they can't\nreally because they they need to cover\nso many AWS services. It's manually\nwritten as well. And I'm still relying\non the Terapform provider AWS except I'm\nbuilding the CDK library on top of it.\nSo, so this is the example from AWS CDK,\nbut now it's running on top of\nterraform, right? So, I have the same\nthings. I have the code, the lambda\nfunction, the lambda rest API. Um, for\nsome reason, I didn't call it function.\nI called it lambda function. And that's\nbecause I put everything under under one\nname space. I put it all under AWS\ncompute, which maybe was a mistake, but\nokay. Uh, and then I have the AWS asset\nlike the stack, the AWS stack, which is\na um extension of the classic Terraform\nstack. This is a stack that understands\nabout AWS asset pipelines. So it knows\nabout ECR. It knows about S3. So it\nknows that if you use and that's\nnecessary because when you use AWS CDK\nit's built on top of AWS. It's built on\ntop of cloud form. So it has the ID of\nasset pipeline and things like that. So\nif I want to do this code from asset\nhere, I actually am building if I\nsynthesize this\n>> I I actually have the S3 bucket. If I\ndon't pass in the bucket to the the\nstack, it will create a bucket for me\nand it will automatically upload my uh\nlambda source code bundled up and put it\nstraight into my S3 bucket. Now some\npeople when you are doing terraform\nthey'd be like no your your code\ndelivery must be decoupled right on one\nside terraform stand up the the skeleton\nand on the other side you have your\nactual code that needs to be built and\nand deployed. But when you're in the\nserverless world the resources and your\nactual business logic are very tightly\ncoupled. That's so true. That's so true.\nSo I think the next question in my brain\nwas that okay you create a bucket for\nthe for the sourcing your your\napplication code but like what happens\nwhen you destroy that with the bucket go\n>> uh or yes or do\n>> so this is your terraform under the hood\nright um there is yeah the the terraform\ncall because the bucket is the object is\nalso managed by terraform so terapform\nwill first delete the object then if the\nbuck then it will delete the bucket AWS\nwill prevent that\n>> if there's still some some objects\ninside then it will not allow it.\n>> Okay. So, so you're saying that\nTerraform will completely handle all the\nobjects inside there I suppose.\n>> Yeah. So, so this is purely translating\nthe AWS CDK on a deep deep level\ndirectly to Terraform resources and not\njust any resources but the actual\nTerraform provider AWS resources. That\nmeans that all of your existing like\nterraform linting um you know code code\nscanning everything still works. Cool.\nAnd then and then another question\nbecause uh C CDK I believe has this\nbootstrap uh functionality where it does\ncreate its own bucket for the stack up\n>> right.\n>> Yeah. So I don't I don't do that. Um no\nmy AWS stack has like a it's called like\na singleton pattern. It will create an\nS3 bucket if it's necessary. You can\npass it in directly to the AWS stack as\nu stack as well. So when you invoke this\nlike my CDK workshops tag when I call\nthe constructor if I in the constructor\nproperties pass in my own bucket then it\nwill take that one right\n>> this is again\n>> the power of actual you know I mean a\nlot of people hate on object-oriented\nprogramming but the ability to define\nlike to use the basic object of a\nterapform stack and then extend it with\nfunctionality just reuse the constructor\nand have this capabilities built in\nmakes it so much nicer like you can't\nreally do that with terapform modules or\nlike bundling terapform models on top of\neach other. Right.\n>> Right. Right. But like Okay. So if you\nhad the option to use the CDK bootstrap,\nyou didn't that's obviously just not a\ndefault here like by default.\n>> Yeah. No, the CDK bootstrap does a lot.\nAnd the actual asset pipeline from AWS\nCDK is built into the CDK CLI. So it's\nnot a cloud for thing. The AWS CDK CLI\nhas the idea of uh bundling code and um\nputting it into a staging directory and\nthen preparing a manifest of what is\ninside the staging directory that needs\nto go into S3, what needs to go into\nECR. So that's what the CLI does.\nTerraform kind of like worked around\nthat by providing special provider\nfunctions. So it doesn't like Terraform\ndoesn't understand or doesn't care about\nAWS asset pipeline, right? But you do\nhave the ability to create like use a\nterapform provider to create an S3\nbucket and upload an S3 object. So I'm\nkind of offloading that asset pipeline\nto native Terapform provider\ncapabilities which I'm not sure if it's\nthe best way but it does allow me to\nlike hand off the life cycle completely\nto Terraform\n>> the way that it does.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n>> Those are all conscious decisions as\nwell.\n>> There's a there's a lot of details in\nhere too. So so say a company's using\nCDK. Um,\n>> but let's be honest, I think we talked\nabout this before. CDK got there um is\ngreat, but it it's only 80% of the way\nthere. Like it and and correct me if I'm\nwrong, like this the support from CDK on\nthe AWS side seems a bit weak right at\nthe moment or do you think they'll come\nback into it or like what?\n>> So that's interesting to hear. Um\n>> I'm trying to I'm trying to like map the\nfuture of CDK\n>> for me is a pivotal tool for or\ndeveloper tooling for AWS to hear that\nthey I know that they've withdrawn some\nof the stuff um but they are still\nactively developing it like they they\nadded the C the CDK refactoring for\nrefactoring stacks across was integrated\ndirectly I mean the cloud formation\nrefactoring feature was was integrated\ncompletely into the CDK. You can\nrefactor stacks now through the CDK CLI.\nThey added an API or like a programmatic\nway to call the AWS CDK as well. So they\nare developing and adding more features.\n>> Okay. So what does what is sorry what\ndoes refactoring actually mean in in the\nin CDK?\n>> Yeah. So in the in the world of\nTerraform or in the world of\ninfrastructure as code, the moment you\nthat you start treating your AWS\nresources as code, um you must be able\nto do things that are you know very\ncommon with code. And I can give you an\nexample for you may start with one\nproject and you create a network and you\ncreate a database and you create a\ncluster or you create something like\nthat and then you deploy your web\napplication. You're running a whole\nKubernetes cluster for your blog, right?\nI'm just kidding. H but then you decide\nthat you know you need to start a second\nproject and you don't want project two\nto completely depend on all the all of\nthe resources that belong to project\none, right? because one day maybe you\nwant to deprecate project one and you\nwant to um you know get rid of it and\nthen project two depends on half of the\nresources. So at that point you must\nmove those shared resources maybe to a\nshared layer or a shared ownership. So\nmaybe there becomes a platform team to\nmaintain the the network and the\nkubernetes cluster and then you have the\ndifferent product teams that deploy on\ntop of it and integrate within it. So\nyou asked me what re what refactoring\nwas, right? And I just said that I think\nrefactoring is a very central part of\ninfrastructure.\n>> Okay, I I got that. So okay, I for some\nreason I had I think you we were talking\nabout it a couple of weeks ago that like\nyou know the CDK the original AWS CDK\nteam um I can't remember the the name of\nthe guy who who Israel. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. He went on to to do wing lang but\nthat didn't that didn't fly\n>> reasons about it. A lot of the comments\nI saw was it's too early. Um people are\nnot ready for this.\n>> I I never really got into it. Um um\nthough, yeah. So in my mind, I thought\nto myself, okay, so CDK doesn't have its\nuh you know, BNFL.\nIs that the right word? I don't know. It\ndoesn't have its uh have a direction\nnow. Uh so um and\n>> I know that a lot of the original core\nmembers have moved on but there's still\na very large community and I think most\nof the projects I know that AWS uses it\nheavily internally like half the time\nwhen I look at like progen or\nbootstrapping or for example the PDK um\nkit\n>> okay so they're using it um\n>> when I look at the features and the\nissues the GitHub issues I see people I\nwork at this service team at AWS and we\nhave this problem and this is how this\nwould help.\n>> AWS project to make it. What is that?\n>> Oh, this is an a really cool um\nwhat I like about this is that it\nincludes like highle graph generation\nand which is another thing that I I\nbelieve is something that Terraform is\nhorrible at and also because of the way\nthat Terraform modules work.\n>> You can generate diagrams from CDK.\n>> Yeah. So there is a project called CDK\nDIA and and the thing is because you\nknow how these objects these constructs\nthey they they contain like a lot of\nhighle uh like intent and and meaning\nright so they actually capture what they\nrepresent. So you can pres represent\nthose in into logos nicely in here.\n>> Wow I can decorate your constructs.\n>> I need this at work. Wow. uh but but\n>> so there's an I inspectable interface\nthat you need you can implement to to\nbasically say how you want your\nconstruct to be shown on the diagram\nwhich you can't even imagine to do\nsomething like that with terraform\n>> this is fascinating so so so basically\nthis PDK is is some\n>> not just that it it has thread like\nplug-in thread composer it's integrated\nwith cloudscape react ts website so you\ncan you know build a their design system\nsetup up cloud cloudfront um you know do\nyour CDN um\n>> what the hell does cloudscape react\nsupposed to mean\n>> it's a system design um sorry not system\ndesign it's a design system from AWS\nthat's how they build their dashboards\nand their components\n>> oh interesting\n>> as far as I understood cloudscape\n>> okay so okay so CDK still has a lot of\nbuying because I mean sorry like\n>> I'm telling you it's a whole world and\nand\n>> because I I I mean yeah to be honest at\nwork clients are for example this client\nI'm working with\n>> has been using CDK and to be honest\n>> it's been fine I mean I I can get behind\nit there's some quality of things that I\nhate about CDK like it doesn't seem to\nbe able to plan\n>> so that's why Terra constructs would be\ngreat\n>> yeah uh so um but besides that um one of\nthe one of the technologies that they\nbought bought into is a is a database\nand the the only official uh\n>> provider is\n>> provider is terraform. So they're\nbasically\n>> those are all cloud form limitations.\n>> So basically they're stuck because they\nhave to they have to start using\nterraform. So at the moment their\npipeline like looks like you know CDK\ndeploy and then do your Terraform um\napplying cool beans but but of course\nthe question in my mind is like okay we\ncan't just keep on using CDK and keep uh\nand then and then use Terraform as a\nbaseline. We have to think about like\n>> aligning things.\n>> Yeah, aligning things. So, so I and\nyeah, we talked about it before, I'm\nsure, but like I think Terraform is the\nthe de facto winner of the day when it\ncomes to IA probably for the next god\nknows how many years\n>> mainly due to adoption.\n>> Yeah. Um\n>> yeah so\n>> I say that and yeah so so where does CDK\nfit in with this the fact that Terraform\nis is definitely not going away\n>> and it's got that sort of mind share uh\nyou know\n>> so at some organizations I worked\n>> the expectation was that the team\ndecides what they want to use if they\nwant to use CDK they can the platform\nteam had three years of platform team\nstuff so we were bootstrapping VPCs EKS\nclusters everything with with Terraform\nAnd so we just had to provide\nintegration points that is kind of\npainful for um because you now have to\ndeal with like different execution\nengines you know cloud formation and so\non. It can work if the team takes full\nownership of their CDK stack. Um but the\nmoment yeah I've also had experiences\nwhere a team has full ownership on their\nstack and then half the team leaves and\none guy is left to maintain it and he\nwas supposed to like work on really cool\ndata engineering stuff and now he has to\nmaintain an airflow cluster and he hates\nit. This sounds very accurate like too\nmany details like where does that come\nfrom?\n>> Yeah. Uh I know what you mean with\nairflow. I mean the whole MWA airflow\n3.0 I don't know if you know about that.\nThat's amaz\n>> I haven't used it for the last five\nyears.\n>> Okay. Well, there's there's basically no\nupgrade path between two and three,\nwhich makes life fun and interesting.\nUh,\n>> LLM upgrade path.\n>> Yeah. So, LLM upgrade. Um,\nyeah. Okay. So, I guess I guess what\nyou're saying is that CDK and Terraform\ncan live side by side. Then sorry where\ndoes Ter I thought when when you\nintroduced to me terror constructs to me\nI actually thought in the back of my\nmind since because of that problem that\nwe have at work we have CDK we have\nTerraform I thought you were like almost\ngifting me the the perfect solution to\nmy problem uh to align everything to\nTerraform\n>> right so what terror constructs does at\nthis point um it's my effort to\ntranslate the AWS CDK developer\nexperience on top of the core terraform\nresources and provider model. Right? So\nthere are some projects um Hashi Cororp\ncreated Terraform CDK to build the\nfoundation to automatically create\nTypeScript classes that wrap the\noriginal Terraform provider. So you can\nconfigure your Terapform resources using\nTypeScript or Golang or Python, right?\nBut Hashior never built the actual\nsystem like service integration\npatterns. it never built the IM um the\nidea of of you know connecting IM. For\nexample, in this case when I when I bind\nthe lambda the handler on top of the\nREST API, it automatically creates the\nservice role and gives the Lambda\nservice principle the ability to assume\nthat role like under the hood and it\nalso\n>> creates\n>> uh hold on. It also creates the Lambda\npermission for the gateway. Yeah,\n>> for the actual execute API gateway to\ncall that lambda and so on. So all of\nthat is is is built on top of the\nservice integration pattern between\nlambda lambda API gateway and IM. So so\nthat those are patterns that exist in\nAWS CDK.\n>> So Terraform CDK never did\n>> did that. But how but that that that to\nme you're saying that you can't imple\nyou can't deploy a lambda with terraform\nCDK then it's going to work\n>> you you just have to write your your\nvery very nice and and small um Hashi\nCororp language config file now you have\nto write a complex TypeScript program to\ngenerate that config file which of\ncourse a lot of people will say that why\nwould I use Terapform CDK. The idea is\nthat now that you have that TypeScript\nobject, you can build your own\nabstractions and you can build your own\nhigher level constructs around it. But\nthere's no interest for Hashi Corp to\nbuild that, right? They're not af Okay.\nSo, so they just got you bootstrapped\nbootstrapped.\n>> Yes, they got you bootstrapped.\n>> So, surely the whole community must have\ncropped up.\n>> This there's a few like\nattempts. So one of them is uh CDKTF\nplus which was from the original people\nbehind CDKTF. So they tried to build\nlike a level two um library of of or\nlayer 2 construct library which is like\n3 years ago but this is pretty much\narchived now. Um and they also built\nsomething else which is called the AWS\nCDK adapter where they automatically\nthey basically let AWS CDK do its job to\ngenerate cloud for resources and then\nmap those cloudformation resources on\ntop of terraform provider resources.\nUnfortunately that doesn't capture half\nof the of the functionality that is\nhidden between these objects interacting\nwith each other. like the way that you\ngenerate resources on for cloud form is\ndifferent from the way that you generate\nthem for um for terform providers and\nthey try to use a common generated\nautogenerated provider through the AWS\ncloud control API. So the cloud control\nAPI is an attempt to make available the\nthe engine behind cloud form. So you can\nactually autogenerate the terform\nprovider from the cloud controller API\nbut it's like it's gong ga I think this\nyear uh or maybe was it last year I'm\nlosing track of the years been working\non this for a year.\n>> Oh what do you mean gongji? What did\nthat word made?\n>> So it was under beta for like two or\nthree years and then it went generally\navailable. So the project to the AWSCC\nprovider\n>> because yeah because yeah like now that\nyou mention it cloud form to terraform\nmakes sense here because ultimately CDK\nis producing cloudformation.\n>> Yes. So they have an adapter but again\nit doesn't capture some of these\npatterns. So if you align the providers\nthen you should get the same\nfunctionality but there's still a whole\nbunch of like resources and patterns\nthat are not supported by this Terraform\nprovider. this autogenerated provider\nand to use it like nobody's really using\nit because when you look at these\nresources you basically get like no the\ngood thing about Terraform is that when\nyou talk to an API object you can expand\na JSON schema into like very strongly\ntype like an expanded um schema in\nterapform language right but in this\ncase the schema is not expanded like\nlet's go to the documentation and look\nat some of these resources maybe take um\nlet's look at the AP API gateway\n>> uh or maybe something simpler SNS or\nsomething I don't\n>> no no let's look at the API gateway\nbecause that is a real resour\n>> we talking\n>> so here we we we have the um you have\nthe open API spec that you pass in\n>> and then you have the deployment the\nstage but what's missing is the\nintegration right like if you hit here\nit's just doing a response\num but it's like it's an X X Amazon.\nAnyway, this is this is not strongly\ntyped. This is just JSON. You end up\njust shoving JSON all over the place.\n>> Yeah. So, so this is the Wait a minute.\nI\n>> understand it though.\n>> This project takes cloudformation and\ngenerates it those resources. Is that's\nwhat you're saying, right?\n>> No, this is the cloud control generated\nTerraform provider. So, there's two\nproviders for AWS. One is manually\nwritten and maintained by people. Every\ntime AWS releases a new feature, adds a\nnew field, adds a new whatever to any\nservice, somebody gets, you know, a pull\nrequest or somebody issue is created and\nthen it's added in\n>> um manually and manually mapped. So a\nlot of like decisions have been made to\ndo things a certain way which is like\ncompletely different from the way cloud\nform does it right.\n>> Interesting. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So the terraform provide AWS is\nwritten by humans. That also means it's\nkind of like a created experience\nbecause it kind of tries to make sense\nof where it expands things uh or how\ndoes it expose certain configuration\nfields. For example, the way that you\ndefine um I think it's like on the again\nbecause I did the API gateway conversion\nrecently there was uh the way that you\ndefine the method responses on on an API\ngateway. The way that the the actual API\nendpoint works is with like a JSON patch\nlike you have one endpoint and you have\nto like JSON patch in the differences\nand in the provider they made a\ndifferent resource for each one of them\nand when under the hood the provider\nwill build the JSON patch and send it to\nthat one endpoint to achieve what you're\ntrying to do. So this is the type of\nstuff that they can do because of the\nAPI endpoints that API gateway exposes\nis very complex for a human to you know\nbuild a JSON patch. uh and then cloud\nfor does a similar thing. It kind of\nlike like abstracts away this complexity\nof that the way that API is built and\nallows you to define it um in in one\nresource. But in terapform provider AWS,\nthey made like many different resources\nand the Golang code takes care of it\nlike building a nice little patch under\nthe hood. So the way that you write your\nconfig is really nice. Um so that's the\nadvantage of a manual written uh\nprovider right compared to like an AWSCC\nautogenerated provider. Um, but that\nalso means that most of the tooling like\nuh code scanning and everything is\naround this provider because everyone is\nthe one using it. Like all of the\nTerraform linting, all of the Terraform\nsecurity scanning, all of the Terapform\ncost calculation tooling is around this\nprovider because everyone's using this\nprovider.\n>> Yeah, I mean that's top provider by like\na way a long way I'm sure.\n>> Yes. I'm not sure about like I know some\npeople sometimes say like I we're using\nAWS CCC because the feature has never\nhas not been built on top of the\nmanually maintained one and the CC one\nhas a chance to adopt features faster\nbecause it's autogenerated.\n>> And do you know how AWSCC works? I mean\nthey they must have a pipeline that\nkicks off with uh\n>> yeah they have a they have a lightweight\nprox API to discover, provision and\nmanage cloud resources. So they they\nautogenerate it. Um I guess it\n>> the source of truth for um AWS if I\nremember is like like a Mason schema or\nsomething like that that describes the\nAPIs.\n>> Yeah, there's that's part of the of the\nPDK here as well. They they have the\ntype save API. Smitty smithy\n>> Smitty.\n>> Why did I say Mason?\n>> Smith because Mason Smith's same thing.\n>> Ah,\nit must be Yes, it must be. Yes, you're\nan LLM after all.\n>> Cuz like 10 years ago, I was working on\nuh in a video startup in Singapore. I'm\nsure I don't know if you remember.\nThat's probably when we met. And\ninterestingly,\num the the service hadn't launched and\nand AWS gave us like this JSON file that\nwas generated with Mason if I remember\ncorrectly. I don't know why Mason, it's\nprobably the wrong word, but they gave\nus a JSON file and then we just copied\nit under the AWS CLI directory and then\nall of a sudden we had all these\ncommands available to us, which I\nthought was really cool.\n>> Oh, I haven't heard about that. That's\nsounds really cool. Um, but yeah, as far\nas I know, Smithy is the the language\nthey use for API specifications or\ndefinition.\n>> Yeah. So, so that's a cool thing about\nthe like the AWS de project development\nkit again because they have this like\nREST API generation from Smithy. Um, and\nthis is how you build your your product.\nUm, so it's kind of like uh build on top\nof the AWS CDK to do that. But yeah, the\nwhole thing I was saying is that you\nhave different providers. Uh, one of\nthem is very popular but manually\nmaintained. The other one is\nautogenerated but doesn't have the full\ncoverage. And I hear from people that\nthere's still quite a few errors or\nproblems that they're facing. But but\nthat almost doesn't that almost doesn't\nmake sense. Surely something that's\nautogenerated has full coverage.\n>> No, it didn't have full No, because the\ncloud control API doesn't have full\ncoverage.\n>> The thing that backs this Yes, it's the\ncontrol. If you go to the website for\nthe AWS control uh cloud control API, it\nwill tell you how much of their actual\nservices they do cover on this.\n>> But that but that's I mean didn't Jeff\nBezel\n>> because every team developed it's like a\ntwo-piece pizza team in AWS, right? They\nbuild their own services. Nobody did a\ncentralized cloud control API, so they\nstarted building a centralized cloud\ncontrol API.\n>> To me, it kind of makes sense.\n>> Well, wait a minute. Like the the folk\nlaw goes that Jeff Bezos mandated that\nevery service team uh publishes their\nAPI. It sounds like they don't if if if\nthey can't if it can't be syndicated by\nthe cloud control API.\n>> Let's look at a year old LLM summary.\nUh\nah see see for example the the\ncertificate uh doesn't support update.\nMaybe that's simply because you can't do\nthat. But here's a little table for you\nof the coverage. Maybe this is also\nmaybe this relates directly to the\ncoverage. Looks like it has quite a lot.\nBut where are the services not covered\nthough? This is anything that is\ncovered. Um I'm wondering if cl if local\nstack is using this because they have a\nvery similar table. So local stack might\nbe using this to to generate their um\ntheir local stack.\n>> So just to reiterate what I think you're\nsaying to me, you're saying that the\nTerraform uh AWS provider has more\ncoverage than something that was\nautogenerated.\n>> When they G8, the AWSCC, they put out a\nnumber on the number of resources\ncovered. and it looked like it was the\nsame number, but when you looked into\nit, it was actually a bunch of like a\nsplit between some of the resources. Or\nmaybe I'm getting this wrong because the\nTerraform provider AWS has special\nresources that don't really have a\nbacking API. Um, but I I need to look\ninto it. They do have like that's\ndefinitely something maybe we can add in\nlater as a clarification on how much is\nthe coverage actually of the FCC\nprovider. But there is a difference.\n>> How did we even get here? Oh my god. We\ntalked about ter we talked about ter\nconstructs. We talked about why\n>> we started with spec kit. We started we\nstarted with spec kit and how it like\nformalizes or gives you workflow to do\nyour LLM work like um development. We\ntalked about some evolution in the cloud\ncode budget thing. We talked about you\nthen asked me more about um like more\nabout to towards Terraform and why I\nbuilt something like Terra constructs. I\nthink so. I gave some examples about the\nevolution of the cloud, the fact that it\nchanged and became so complex and that\nthe integration patterns between the\nservices are complex and therefore a\nsimple config file or terform module\ndoesn't do it anymore. So that's where\num I also give you examples of why the\nAWS CDK is so great. We talked a little\nbit about like it not really being\nmaintained but there's still being a lot\nof new features being added. But but\nwith Terra Constructs, I thought I I saw\nit as a way as as as migrating it. Now\nthat I'm speaking with you at length, it\nsounds like you are not thinking like\nthat. You're thinking that you're going\nto still leverage CDK, but your output\nis going to be Terraform.\n>> No. So, so there isn't an a project from\nHashi Cororp that puts uh a host service\na host um pro object around AWS CDK and\nthen encapsulates the process like when\nAWS CDK generates something it then\ngenerates the Terraform. I'm not doing\nthat. That's the adapter project and I\ndon't believe it can achieve the actual\nfunctionality required. Okay. And we\ntalked and that's why we ended up\ntalking about AWS CC because it uses\nthat AWS CC provider that not so many\npeople use that you know doesn't have\nall of this ecosystem tooling around it\nand and that doesn't like allow you I I\nbelieve like I talked to some people\nbehind the project and they told me that\nit's really just for early stage\ncompanies like quickly want to you know\nprototype how moving towards Terapform\nwould help them maybe get them halfway\nthere like you know have existing AWS\nCDK programs and put like a crud cr\ngrudge around it. So, so you understand\nwhat I'm saying? It's called the AWS\nadapter and um but it's not like a\nlong-term solution for um\nfor your\nYeah, it's called the AWS adapter for\nCDK. And as far as I understand, it's\nnot something like if you start\nGreenfield, you should start, oh, I'm\ngoing to write a CDK and I'm going to\nuse the adapter. I'm going to be using\nTerraform. That's not what it's for.\nIt's meant to be like we have a lot of\nCDK stacks, we want to like quickly\nconvert them over to Terapform and this\ncan give you like a quick uh bridge\ntowards Terraform. That's how I\nunderstand it. Okay. So I threw that\naway and I started on originally not so\ndetailed. I started just I want to be\nable to programmatically build terapform\nconfigurations and the Terraform CDK\nseemed like a good solution to me but\nthen I realized it's missing a lot of\nstuff. So I started building high level\nbut then I keep going lower and\nultimately ended up reimplementing all\nof the core features like asset pipeline\nbundling pipeline IM pipeline like the\nactual IM modules the the concept of the\nyou know the interfaces and the patterns\nthe way it works under the hood and\nthese these are called level two\nconstructs right\n>> yes okay\n>> correct uh asset pipeline is more like\nlike CLI tooling around it but it's part\nof it's part of you could say it's part\nof the L2 stack construct because it's\nlike a higher level. It's using the\nlow-level stack cloud for stack under\nthe hood, but it's adding a whole bunch\nof functionality around it.\n>> And just for my vocabulary, L1 is the\nlow level. L2 is like the asset\npipeline. Is it is there an L3? No.\nSo there are some L3 tries which are\ncreated by professional services at AWS\nwhere they have like some um more\nadvanced cloud patterns maybe for banks\nthat are building like a subscriber um\nlike producer type of pattern in the\ncloud. So they will use several L2s and\ncombine them into a cloud pattern so\nthat it can be used by businesses that\nwould be an L3 or an L3 might be um\nmaybe\nthe real product that that I'm building\nat my company um that is actually\ndeploying the front end deploy deploying\nthe back end.\n>> The whole product that makes sense so\nand then and then the other terminology\nI'm just mapping into into these L1 L2\nL3 is like construct and and pattern. So\na construct would maybe would be level\none and then a pattern would be level\ntwo like how do you or it's not a very\ngood mapping\n>> they they they this they this they this\nthey this they they apply the L label to\nall constructs. So constructs are either\nof L1 or L2 or L3. So the L1 constructs\nare autogenerated from the b basic\nresources that are available in cloud\nform or if you're talking about\nTerraform the L1 resources are the ones\nthat are the Terapform provider\nresources directly. Okay, that makes\nsense cuz I think I've seen I got\nconfused by that. So, and then where\ndoes the the word pattern fit in here?\nIt doesn't really fit in.\n>> Yeah, I think it's more like when they\ntalk about L3, there is like the service\nteam. I know that there is like a\nwebsite from AWS service team that says\nthat these are L3 patterns. These are a\nbucket with a in with a with a lambda\ninvocation triggers for example. That's\na pattern that you may want which is a\nvery common pattern that you build in\nterraform as well right um you have a\nmodule that creates I have a bucket and\nthen I have a handler for a function\nthat whenever an object get pushed in\nmaybe have some type of filtering logic\nto invoke the lambda that's like a\nmodule that you would build right um and\nin in Terraform you would build that\nmodule from the low-level L1 um you know\nlambda resource and and the bucket and\nthe service permission the IM rule\nresource and all that in in AWS CDK you\nwill build that L3 using the L2\nconstruct which is encapsulating the\nlambda and knows how to bind itself uh\nlike it it it's backed by an I principle\nthat means that the lambda has a IM role\nbehind it right so so it it it exposes\nitself as a as a interface so it's I am\na principle and a principle you can\ngrant things right so when you have a\nlum when you have a bucket and then you\nneed to give a permission to the lambda\nyou are basically you you're using the\ngrant method method that accept an I\nprinciple. It can the I principle can be\na lambda in this case but it can also be\nan EC2 instance. Isn't Isn't the better\nterminology would be to call it like a\nservice principle because it's a it's\nit's the service is\n>> it's I think it's closely tied to the IM\nuh terminology which like in an IM\npolicy you have the principle the\nresource the action\n>> I forgot the rest so they they use the\nthe same idea the I principle the only\nnew yeah\n>> the only new one is the grant\n>> but but there can be different types of\nprinciples right you can have a user\nprinciple but you can als you can have a\nhuman all of behind I principle in the I\nmodule. Yeah.\n>> Okay. Okay. Let's we're probably just\nsplitting hands at this point. Okay. So,\nso terra constructs\num\nso I still actually don't quite\nunderstand. So where is it going to fit\nin in a in a company just just where\nwhere people\n>> So the way that we use it at my\norganization is we have two three years\nof Terraform landing zone and so on and\nthen we had the product teams that\nwanted to build with CDKTF uh because\nthey prefer Typescript they write uh\ntheir lambdas in Typescript. they write\ntheir nextgs front end, back end, BFF,\nwhatever, and they like TypeScript and\nthey want a CDKFF and I I had experience\nwith AWS CDK and I was like, yeah,\nthat's I I encourage it. I mean, um I I\nwould rather you not use AWS CDK because\nof cloud formation than I have, like you\nsaid, I have to build uh CI/CD pipeline\nto do the plan to post the the preview\nin my PR. I've got all of that already.\nI've got Terraform, I've got Atlantis,\nI've got, you know, coordination,\ncollaboration. So, we need\n>> So, basically, how does the pipeline\nwork? The product has its repo. it\nwrites its uh their CDK and then you\nhave a you have like a GitHub action or\nsomething that basically turns their CDK\ninto Terraform and runs it or do you or\ndo you like get a snapshot and then you\ncommit it to your own Terraform uh repo\nor something?\n>> Yeah. So I just did this presentation at\nthe um AWS community day in Koala Lumpur\nMalaysia.\n>> Oh yeah. How was that by the way? Was\nthat was that at the AWS offices right\nor\n>> Yeah, it was no it was at the university\nuh in in Koala Lumpur. Oh\n>> um but I do cover exactly how does the\nworkflow work between the team. So how\ndo I\n>> Okay, we need to link this link link in\nthe description.\n>> Yeah. So this is an example of an L2. Um\nit's actually more like an L3 because\nthis is like a load balanced Fargate\nservice. So this uses under the hood it\nuse you see it uses something called\npatterns. So under the hood it actually\nset up a load balancer. It set up an ECS\nfar task definition.\n>> So that's that's something that comes\nout of AWS CDK right?\n>> Yes. There's a separate library of\npatterns and an application load\nbalanced fargate service is a\ncomposition of several of the L2\nconstructs to to expose this.\n>> Okay. Okay. So pattern does exist. Okay.\nI wasn't going crazy. Okay.\nI think patterns is like the service\nteam um built L trees. I think\n>> I I think when when you talk about L\ntrees, it's like you can build L trees\nand we build a couple of L tries and we\nwe have we expose them as a pattern\nlibrary. Yeah, I also forgot about that\nit exist that that's the name of the\nlibrary. Yeah. So our workflow at at my\norganization with CDKTF is that the\nproduct team lives in their own\nrepository, right? And we're trying to\nreduce the number of repositories. So if\na product team has front end and back\nend uh and and an infrastructure, we're\ntrying to use more of a monor repos now\nbecause we became good good at them. We\nuse like a many monor repos. So it's\nkind of like\n>> so the so one product one one repo,\nright? That's what you're aiming for.\nOkay, that make sense.\n>> Yes. Kind of like you know the idea of\nof is it Conway's law where you organize\nyour services based on your team or your\norganization layout. So if you have one\nteam working on one product\n>> so so we have the product mono\n>> and they are defining their product in\nTypescript lambdas whatever tightly\nintegrated with their infra resources\nthat they require for their product.\nsome of the resources like in this case\nthe the the cluster the VPC they will be\ninjected when they integrate into the\nlending zone right but then but they\nmust be able to define those and they do\nthat in a very strongly typed language\nTypeScript and they use SEO constructs\noriginally they use CDKTF but that means\nthey have to build their own L2s instead\nwe are building the L2s publicly make\nthem available on Apache 2 and then we\nare using them internally within our\norganization okay\n>> nice nice so\n>> so then yeah\n>> okay So\nI mean like I'm just thinking of um my\ncurrent client\nthey use CDK\nand then they also use Terraform. So So\nwhy what I mean surely didn't didn't you\nthink about uh allowing the product team\nto run their CDK?\nI was lucky they didn't ask they didn't\npush for it. I did I think about it. I\nwas I was thinking actually about\ntalking pointing them towards Palumi SST\nbecause that's kind of a bit of a\nsimilar idea but then we would need to\nadopt Palumi because Pulumi is\ncrosscloud but then I wasn't sure about\nlike the self-hosted Palumi story and at\nthe time I didn't know that you could\nlike self-host Palumi. I only heard that\nit was expensive and that you had to pay\nfor the cloud and so on.\n>> But I'm not too sure why you're talking\nabout Palumian because you can't just\nyou could have a\n>> Yeah, I could have let them use cloud\nformation, right? And then it could\npublish the cloud.\n>> You didn't even you didn't want to go\nthere or something. What were you\n>> No, I have experience with that in the\npast. Um we had one team heavily in\ncloud formation and then we had the\nwhole rest of the company data team\neveryone else using terraform and I was\nput as part of the team that was using\nAWS CDK and I was completely convinced\nthat AWCK was way better. I was I was\nput in there to convert them to\nTerraform and they converted me to you\nknow the this the the CDK story and then\nI spent a year trying to build um\nintegration patterns between Terraform\nand cloud formation. So you must consume\nlike integration between two different\nproducts and then you must expose them.\nSo I was using SSM parameter store as an\nintegration registry which is Keith\nMorris um you know infrastructure as\ncode.\n>> Keith Morris is my line manager. I don't\nknow if\n>> exactly right you told me that. So, so I\nfollowed his advice uh about his\ninfrastructure as code third edition\nwhatever uh book and follow the\nintegration pattern of um integration\nregistry using SSM parameter store. Now\nthe\n>> tell him I sent him a message on\nLinkedIn and he never replied.\n>> Okay, I'll I'll uh I'll let Ke know. Ke,\nif you're watching respond. Uh okay, so\nchapter what 17? You you're oddly\nspecific here, Vincent, but carry on.\nYeah, because I did a presentation about\nit. Um,\nI called it integrate this. I did it\nlike at the time when I had just\nfinished building the integration\npatterns and I thought uh this is great.\nUm,\n>> and that's the latest book, right?\nBecause he he had a\n>> yes I I I have already uh subscription\nso I get access early early access and I\nread it. Um so these are the actual\ndiagrams from his book and he's talking\nabout organizing your infrastructure and\nthen the different in integration\npatterns. You have one provider, you\nhave one consumer and then you can do\nresource matching which is you look up\nthe resources based on some tags or you\ncan do um stack data lookup. So if you\nhave one stack in cloud form and then it\nhas some outputs. So you need to read\nthose cloud form outputs and then um\nintegrate them within another cloud for\nstack for example. But you know need to\nknow what the team is using. And then\nthe other one is the integration p uh\nregistry lookup pattern where everyone\nwrites to a different key convention and\nthen you can look up through the\nintegration registry. Right.\n>> Okay. Okay. I mean this is quite common\nactually. So Keith basically wrote it\nup. I mean I've seen this everywhere.\n>> SSM SSM is the registry.\n>> Yeah. So when we adopted it we didn't\nhave strong conventions about the the\nformat of the keys. What are the like\nthe different paths that you need to\ncapture. We didn't have a clear\nguideline of how to write your\ndependencies out and how to read them\nback because if you put some rules\naround that then you can you know\ndetermine that this will be like a\nnetwork will have a a list of certain\nideas and so you read it out the right\nway the right way because now you're in\ntype languages like CDK and Terraform\nmaybe you can read it properly.\n>> So the key go specify the actual typing.\n>> No I don't think that's part of it. uh\nit just mentioned that this is a pattern\nyou can follow. It's just my personal\nexperience when I I started to use it.\nWe had problems like that like teams\ndidn't have a clear way or convention on\nhow to write to it. Uh another problem\nis that this becomes an a layer of\nindirection and becomes stale like how\ndo you you know keep it up to date? How\ndo you know that the value has changed?\nHow do you notify also because it's a\nlayer of interaction how do you have\ndirect connectivity between provider and\nconsumer? How do you know everyone that\nconsumes that key if you don't have like\na an actual like point po point po point\npo point po point po point po point po\npoint po point po point po point pointer\ncounting like if you do this in memory\nyou will you keep track of how many um\nactual variables point to the stack\nright so you have some counter and then\nyou can know if anyone is still reading\nit and so none of that right and so when\nyou start it sounds very simple and I\nwas very confident I did this\npresentation I say this solves all of\nour problems but at that time I already\nrealized that like having some type of\ngenerics around it so that we and type\nwhen we read it back out is actually\nreally nice. Um, but that never really\nhappened, right? Our teams had written a\nwhole bunch of stuff into SSM parameter\nstore and then we couldn't really keep\ntrack of like who was consuming it. I\nalso thought that this was great that\nthis was a a read indirection layer\nbecause now it meant that I could move\nthings around and then just update the\nregistry from different places. Big\nmistake because you have no idea where\nit comes from. So, so this pattern um is\nwhy I did not like my teams to use cloud\nformation and then adopt some type of\nindirection layer to communicate with\nthem, right? So, I actually tried to\nroll this out and I had my landing zone\npublish all of its like integration\npoints into the SSM parameter store. Uh\nand then you get other problems like how\ndo you control the consumer permissions\nor who can write to these keys? How do\nyou, you know, do you cross-ost like do\nyou do you have a central one or do you\nhave this one provider right to\ndifferent accounts where they have to\nfind it? So, there's a lot of of of\nproblems there and I decided I'm just\ngoing to get rid of this whole problem\nby just using the native built-in\nTerapform stack feature which is, you\nknow, Terraform outputs. Right.\n>> Right. I mean, I'm just thinking I'm\njust mapping this to my own experience\nabout a registry. I think the one at my\nworkplace that we ended up just doing is\nis essentially we keep a huge a like a a\nsource of truth a JSON file in GitHub\nand we use that to sort of coordinate a\nlot of stuff because like hey you want\nto know where this is which account this\ngoes into what what secret you need.\n>> It's horrible isn't it?\n>> I I like it. I like\n>> it's horrible. I like a single uh large\nJSON file. I mean because you know\n>> JSON even even worse if it was YAML\nyou wouldn't have all these like\ntrailing commas or next line changes\nwhen you know these git tips would look\na little bit better.\n>> In my opinion the JSON can is is just an\noutput uh here but but it's good. It's\nit's it's a better paradigm than\nsprinkling stuff across an SSM paths for\nChrist's sake.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Agree. Um so so very common\nlike you said is the TFRs in terapform\nworld where people you know copy paste\nTFRS files around for this environment\nwe need those TFRs from that environment\nwe need this TFRS it's a bit similar\n>> but like but this but this is like even\nbigger this is across environments\nuh\n>> with Terrant you also have the ability\nto like define dependencies and it\nautomatically create the JSON files and\ncaches them under the hood and then it\nkeeps track of them to like more quickly\nrun like consumer provider interactions\nand so on. But Teragrant again also very\nquickly becomes like sprawls out of\ncontrol, right? So, so you're asking me\nlike why did I not just allow them to\nwrite their infrastructure in AWS CDK\nand I I'm telling you that my biggest\nproblem was the integration patterns.\nYou're saying one solution could have\nbeen to create more like a central file\nso that they would need to read from\nthere um and things like that. But when\nyou say central file, it sounds very\nsimilar to SSM parameter store.\n>> Yeah, but but SSM parameter store gets\nout of hand because you could you could\nuse arbitrary paths. You can use\n>> what about the JSON file? What are the\narbitrary like fields paths that you use\nin JSON files?\n>> They're just they're just keys and you\nknow,\n>> but what's the structure of the keys and\nare they nested keys?\n>> Well, you have the same problem.\n>> Well, they are they are nested. Yeah. Uh\n>> yeah. how\nthat's where you then get similar\nproblems.\n>> I think I think majority of them are\njust are are just keys. They're not like\nlists if that makes sense.\n>> That's I think one thing I learned about\nTerraform because a lot of people when\nthey write a module they go like well\nthis resource that I just created should\nreally be accessible and they just you\nknow output the all of the attributes of\nthe resource to the module and then you\nknow you're basically have zero\nencapsulation. The idea of modules is a\nbit encapsulation so that you don't\ncreate these deeply nested attributes\ndictionary key values um but you rather\ncreate individual outputs like if you\nwant the gateway uh endpoint there's a\nvariable there's one key for the gateway\nendpoint if you want the subnet ID uh\nmaybe um you know maybe that's a list\nbecause subnet ID is usually like three\nwhatever but but not deeply nested\nobjects basically detailed attributes as\nindividual outputs\n>> yeah I think That's I think we're\naligned there. Yeah. But like\n>> it it works well. Um um and the the best\nthing of all cuz I don't think SSM can\nreally do this very well except you can\nlook back in the versions. But like the\nbrilliant thing about central registry\nis that you have the really nice change\nlog.\nYou have logs on on SSM parameter store.\nBut I think I think the idea is this.\neither you put it in git or you have\nsomething wrapping more as a service\naround SSM parameter store but just like\nno control over parameter store\n>> is definitely a recipe for disaster.\n>> Yeah. A config file in git is the sweet\nspot for me. I know it works well.\n>> Okay.\n>> We're getting a little bit distracted. I\nmean, so you you were saying you you\nwere pushing people you you didn't want\npeople to to deploy to run CDK deploy\njust because of coordination issues, I\nguess, is what I'm hearing.\n>> Yes. Um, one of the main issues was to\navoid stale values and copy value across\nthe source of truth of the integration\nbecause this again is not in a single\nrepo, right? It's across many\nrepositories and\nbecause of that we originally had tried\nto have the product monor repo run the\nterraform apply and consume across um\nyou know SSM parameter store but that\ndidn't really work so instead we still\nkeep the dev infra directly applied from\nthe product manual repo. So for the dev\nenvironment they can run terraform apply\nevery time they make a change without\ngoing through any integration\nrepository. But when they want to go\ntowards\num so when they run apply here on the\ndev infra folder basically the package\ngets consumed in the dev infra\napplication uh or environment and when\nthe developer runs apply it creates the\nenvironment the the the resources in\npink here purple here and then the\nintegration with like the dev ingress\nALB and the dev VPC and so on right so\nso we are copying over the VPC ID the\nALB reference as values into the dev F\nmonor repo but it we're not copying\nstaging and prod and all the other\nenvironments just one only dev okay\n>> okay okay environment they're completely\nthey have full full control over the dev\nenvironments which they should they\nshould be able to do what they need\nright and then when it comes to actually\npromoting this out of dev um they've\ndone their QA themselves and they want\nto put this into like staging or prepro\nthat's where they are um versioning and\nreleasing\na an actual artifact. So they're\npublishing their infra package which no\nlonger is a module. We don't need\nspecial terapform registry or anything\nlike that. We can just use their\nexisting u pnpm workflow or npm\npackaging workflow or python if they\nwant because cdk can be python but we\ndon't do that. So so so you don't need\nlike special artifact management for\ninfrastructure anymore. Infrastructure\nis managed the same way as your code.\nYou're deploying, you're publishing and\nminting, versioning, change lock,\neverything. All of your tools can just\nbe reused and we p push it into code at\neffect.\n>> So, okay,\n>> I'm still a little bit puzzled here. You\ncall it a package, but is surely it's\nit's it's not a whole bunch of code.\nSurely it's just some\n>> Oh, it is a bunch of code. It is a bunch\nof code. It is like\n>> So basic so basically the code and dev\nand the code and\n>> it's if you are familiar with\nKubernetes, we don't use Kubernetes. So\nit's like a Kubernetes Helm chart. Oh,\nokay. Okay. Sorry. I I read product as\nuh as production. Sorry. Sorry. I think\nthat's where I was confused.\n>> It's good you asked this because this is\nthe most common question I get about\nTerra constructs. Like sounds great, but\nhow do you actually use it? And that's\nwhat I try to focus on on this\npresentation.\n>> So yeah, you're saying that this is the\nmost common questions uh why of the\nthing.\n>> Yeah. So after I talk about all of the\ngreat things that you can, you know,\nthat you get because now you get these\nreally nice developer patterns or\nservice integration patterns.\n>> Now, now that you mentioned Atlantis,\nyeah, Atlantis is uh is great. I\nactually need to work out how to\nintroduce that into my into my uh\ncompany. M so I'm I'm I have a\ncustomuilt EMI and I have custom CDKTF\nworkflows and I want to for Terra\nconstructs and I want to publish my AMI\nas like the bootstrap for Terra\nConstruct. So if you want to start with\nTerra Constructs in your organization\nhere is your construct to bootstrapped\nAtlantis. So it deploys Atlantis with\nall of the settings for running CDKTF\nsynthesis to Terapform running Terapform\napply integration with your pull request\nand all that.\n>> That's my I mean if you yeah like if if\nyou\n>> but I don't have if your elevator pitch\nis basically how to use Atlantis with\nCDK I think I get it actually. My my\npitch is you want better devx for your\ndevelopers and most people are like\nuh it's complicated why do I need an\nadditional synthesis step how do I\nintegrate it into my Atlantis um I can't\ncontrol my developers and my engineers\nthey are very creative they create\nreally convoluted\ninfrastructure if I let them write them\nin typescript uh how do you control that\nwell that's where I think part of\nproduct like platform team is that you\nsurface is the pattern so that you can\nyou know with bootstraps so that you can\n>> so that you extract the convoluted\npatterns into reusable patterns I don't\nknow\n>> to keep the things align I mean the same\nthing with modules right people are\ngoing to write crazy modules\n>> it sounds like you are doing a a great\nthing in a sense like allowing the\nproduct team to use a code that's\nfamiliar to them but ultimately uh\nkeeping Terraformers\n>> the first class infrastructure uh uh\nDevX I think that makes a lot of sense\nactually\n>> I'm trying to bridge the platform team\nand the product team because the\nplatform team lives in breeds terapform\nthey have three years of you know code\nscanning they have their whatever maybe\nthey're not using Atlantis but they have\ntheir own GitHub workflows to run and\napply um their Terraform with pull\nrequest like PR reviews uh previews\nsorry yeah\n>> I I love what you just said there uh\nbuilding a bridge between platform and\nand product team though like I'm just\nalso mapping this to my current uh gig\nright now. I mean I think if I showed\nthem this at at my workplace they would\nbe terrified because we don't want\nproducts to develop to write\ninfrastructure as code. We want them to\nconfig like we want a very very tight\nconfiguration for them like all all\n>> find this funny because there's a saying\nis it from\nwe want products to be able to do what\nthey need to do without being blocked by\nplatform right platform must provide\ngolden paths must provide easy adoption\nfor the um for the cloud but they cannot\nbe the bottleneck they cannot be the\nones that are preventing\nthe team. Um,\n>> well, that's I I agree. I totally agree\nwith that. But like but in a in a\n>> uh Yeah, but in a in a but in a big\ncompany it it's not scalable.\nI I can see it making a thousand.\n>> No, that's why platform teams exist,\nright? Platform teams are supposed to\nprovide the tools so that you can keep\nit under control so that the product\nteams can still evolve. So you in like\nbig banks you will have like a\ndeclarative YAML config file that under\nthe hood sets up 10 different terraform\nmodules in just the right way so that\nthey get deploy uh what they need or\nmaybe use custom resources because\nyou're on Kubernetes or whatever right\nso this is from platform con 20 uh 2024\ntalk from Gregor Hop and he talks like\nnobody wants 80% of Dynamob like your\nmodule is not just like exposing sane\ndefaults as a better Dynamob under under\nthe hood, they still need the features\nof Dynamob and if your module doesn't\nexpose it, your module is not better,\nright? It's just it's just restricting\naccess to it. But it's\n>> that's a very that's very interesting.\nUh\ndid you ever meet Gregor? Because he\nused he lived in Singapore a few fair\nfew years.\n>> I was at a few conferences where he was\nas well, but I never really interacted\nmuch with him. Yeah, he he spoke at the\nAWS meetup, too. That this is very\ninteresting because like I think I mean\nI feel like I've been drinking through a\nstraw somehow because every every gig\nI'm on, we make a module to give give,\nyou know, 80% to the developer. And now\nyou're sort of you're sort of flipping\nthe table over here by saying that no\nyou're uh\nyour platform team should be allowing\nthem to do\n>> one of my previous CTOs at uh previous\ncompany he was ex AWS as well I don't\nthink he was in a technical role there\nbut he um basically had a lot of\nexperience on how they did things at AWS\nand he says the platform team's\nresponsibility is to put in guard rails\nthey're not the bottleneck they just\nneed to make sure that teams can do what\nthey need to do without shooting\nthemselves in the foot. So your job\nreally is put in place, you know, the\nthe scanners, the llinters and the\ndashboards around it. So if we do have a\nmisconfiguration, we can catch it as\nmost of the lift as possible.\n>> I mean, I'm I I'm fully behind that.\nLike so basically the platform team\nisn't uh producing modules, they're more\nlike producing confest type stuff,\nright? Or linting type stuff. But like\nI've just never seen\n>> but at the same time like the goal of\nthe platform team is to observe teams\nusage of the cloud and extract golden PS\nso that we can keep teams aligned so\nthat you know teams don't do completely\ndifferent things so that if a new team\nwants to start a new project they have a\ntech radar and they can figure out today\nthe recommended way of doing that is\nusing this golden path and if I follow\nthis golden path\n>> that definitely doesn't happen in my\ncurrent workplace like The idea is that\nis that uh we're laying the tracks\nbefore the product teams get there and\nuh hopefully it's the tracks that they\nwant to take which is something that\nI've always heard as a complaint around\nplatform teams and actually one company\nI worked at was very resistant and very\nagainst towards moving towards a\nplatform team they had embedded SRE\nthere was a huge um compliance\ninitiative and they completely refused\nbecause they were like you guys are\ngoing to be a bottleneck. You're going\nto prevent us to do what we want to do.\n>> And and to just to be clear, uh I as an\ninfrastructure engineer, I I hate\nplatform teams. The whole idea for me is\njust terrible. I'm more in favor of a\ncross functional embedded uh so uh\nembedded infrastructure engineer\npattern,\n>> but I always end up as the\ninfrastructure engineer in a platform\nteam essentially. Uh and the funny thing\nis I've been at a lot of organization\nthat try to push me towards in embedded\nSR role and I always end up completely\nwithdrawing myself from product and\nfocusing 100% on the cloud and the CI/CD\nand how to make a solution that\nstretches across all the teams and then\ncomplaining if people are not using it.\nSo I I have like the the opposite like\nhabits of view\n>> but I I try to really focus now like I\nwant to be part of the of the product\nteam. I want to be part of the road map\nbut it's very hard for me.\n>> There's some very interesting approaches\nhere. I mean can you I mean I can't\nclaim to I can't claim the current\nworking uh approach in my client is is\nsuccessful. I can't claim that at all\nbut it's very uh conservative and very u\nestablished way of doing things. Can you\nhonestly say to me, Vincent, that you've\nyou've worked with product teams and\nyou've given them a golden what did you\nsay? A golden\n>> golden path.\n>> A golden path and they loved it. I mean,\nthat sounds also kind of Let's be\nhonest.\n>> I did I say that I give them a golden\npath and they loved it.\n>> Well, I mean,\n>> I I did work at one organization.\n>> That's what you're alluding to, right?\nSo we did I did in in that same\norganization where they went full in on\nAWS CDK um where the platform team had a\nlot of Terraform. We had a very heavy\nKubernetes footprint and we built a\nGolang CLI that bootstrapped deployments\non top of Kubernetes and\nwe had the funny thing is we had like 40\nbrands and but it was behind it was\nalways this two teams and so it was very\neasy to roll it out across the teams and\nwe were able to like align all of the\nteams but we did get the feedback from\nthe CTO like I I didn't mean to create\nlike an isolated team that built the\nplatform and then another isolated and\nthen the product team. We want I wanted\nDevOps. I wanted you know embedded\nSRRES. I wanted you guys to to build on\nyou know for the product and I mean\nI don't know um we rolled it out we used\nit. It was we used Argo CD so it was\ngenerating all of the uh manifests for\nour GitOps and it was able to centralize\nthe Helm charts. So we had like the\nability to roll out and ch make changes.\nI think the biggest problem right when\npeople when teams move away from like\nembedded SRS towards platform teams is\ncompliance. When you start doing audits\nand sock 2 and all that then suddenly\nnow you have to integrate the zero trust\nall over the company. Now you certainly\nhave to have the you know bill of uh\nsoftware bill of material asbomb and you\nhave to track and you know provide audit\nreports that you are addressing uh\nvulnerabilities um on on time. You have\nto provide your full uh network\ninfrastructure and your firewall rules\nas a compliance audit report quarterly.\nYou have to have great glassass\nfunctionality. When all of that becomes\nimperative to the product teams,\nsuddenly you need to have a more\ncentralized approach towards managing\nyour infrastructure. And that's where\norganizations tend to then switch more\ntowards platform teams. That's also I\nthink one of Hashikcom's um\npresentations from like evolution of\nlike maturity. So all of the\norganizations start with this um\nno that's not what I wanted. I just\nwanted\n>> center view. Who who does that?\n>> Uh I'm clearly not a a dude that's used\nto make presentations. Anyway, so so\nstage one like singular teams, ad hoc\napproach, everyone does whatever they\nwant. Sing to standardizing, centralized\ndeploys, policy enforcement, team\ncollaborations, and then platform team\nself-service.\n>> Yeah. I'm I'm usually in that stage\nthree uh uh what do you call it journey?\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. So so and and that's also funny\nbecause like most Most startups or\norganizations don't hire DevOps until\nthey start hitting these centralization\nproblems, right? And then they're hiring\nDevOps because they have reliability\nissues. They have a disparity in\ntechnology stacks across different\nteams. They have no way of like rolling\nout compliance. Uh but the good thing is\nthey have money, they have revenue and\nso they can hire DevOps team which is\nDevOps. the whole idea of like being\nembedded in like breaking down the walls\nuh being doing agile now becomes no we\nactually are hiring a system\nadministration team to help us adopt the\ncloud and tame it and\n>> are you suggesting standardizing is uh\nis dev is is the embedded approach\nbecause\n>> no no no no standardizing is the\nplatform approach.\nYeah, because I thought\n>> a lot of organizations they will have um\n>> so so so so stage one so stage one is\nthe is the uh cross functional team\napproach right? Yeah. And then and then\nalready in stage two we have to have\n>> So what do you mean with cross\nfunctional? I think stage one is when\nevery team has like ah cross functional\nmeaning every team has a guy doing\nDevOps or the CI/CD.\n>> Yeah. Exactly.\n>> More like embedded. Right. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. It's interchangeable here to me.\nSo stage one is embedded because that's\nbecause we because at my my employ my my\nconsultancy employer we we always\nadvocate uh a cross functional embedded\nuh infrastructure engineer but it never\nreally happens for one reason or another\nas I mentioned. So and that's already\nstage one. I feel that's that's kind of\nfrightening because there's a very\ninteresting book that one of a candidate\nI interviewed pointed me out. I think he\nworked at works as well. He told me that\nto read team topologies which is there's\nan evolution of the teams and and how\nyou like there's there's an in between\nthere's like fully embedded everyone\ndoes its own there's like platform at\ncomplete opposite and then there's like\na cross like a lot of like bandwidth\nbetween um how you may have\n>> because because this diagram doesn't\nseem to even it's it's either like\n>> yeah no this is a sales pitch from Hashi\nCorp which sells a platform solution\nright\n>> yeah I get it I get Uh yeah, so this was\na original slideshow that I made for\nbefore I started Terra Constructs which\nwas the idea was to make something\ncalled the environment toolkit and I\ndon't know why I cannot zoom in uh zoom\nout anymore. Um but basically\nthe problem is that we have two personas\nin a lot of organizations. We have\nproduct teams, we have platform teams.\nWell, there's a few others, but like uh\nand the idea was like the app team, they\nare the ones that need the like a very\nnice interface. They should\n>> if you just give them YAML without any\nschema, then they may shoot them, they\nmay not really know how it works. Um and\nand it's not a very nice experience for\nthem, but that's commonly what's done\ntoday, which is like you give them a\nYAML spec file that they have to fill in\nand then under the hood, the platform\nteam builds the actual modules. like you\nsay they set the path they they\n>> the things right um\n>> why do you say why do you say it's not\nvery nice\n>> cuz well\n>> I think YL is not very nice\n>> well I mean it's I mean it's a lot\neasier than them bloody writing code CDK\nlet's be honest\n>> why is the file read only this is my\nfile\n>> and maybe maybe a separate comp\n>> sorry did you say again about what's not\nvery nice.\n>> The the YAML driven\nuh product team. What's wrong with that?\n>> Um the problem with YAML is that\nif you miss a space, you get an error.\nIf you you don't know exactly where\n>> use pickle, guys.\n>> No, you should use a proper programming\nlanguage. Stop inventing all these\nadditional like Q and um what's the\nother ones? JSON net and like there's a\nthousands of them there's a hundreds of\nthem and all of them have the same\nproblem\n>> but they become a programming language\nultimately in the end all of them become\nprogramming languages\n>> during that conf\nI I I met some Apple engineers and they\nwere they pitched pickle and I was\nconvinced that pickle is the is is a\nreally good way of uh\n>> yeah so so that that's what I'm trying\nto say with this thing here um there's a\nwhole bunch of like you just told me the\nIDE experience. Does Spickle have a nice\nIDE in terms?\n>> It does. Unfortunately, it seems to\n>> Wrong example.\n>> They they seem to favor Jet Brains, but\nuh you know\n>> Oh, so anyway, does Pickle have a proper\npackage manager and registry?\n>> Yes. Yes.\n>> It's so good. It's so good.\n>> This is is pickle touring complete?\n>> I think so. Yes.\n>> Wrong. Copic language shouldn't be too\nincomplete.\n>> Then why are you not writing it in\nGolang?\n>> Uh you can't expect people to pick up\nGolang.\n>> Yeah. So So\n>> Pickle's designed to\n>> for one task in mind. Uh is explained to\nme by by the um the Apple engineer. He\nsays like uh you know you need it's the\nalarm has gone up gone off. It's 2:00\na.m. and you need to make that change\nsafely.\nSo, so essentially you're logging into\nthat m to that machine at 2 a.m. and\nmaking a config change that you could\nliterally cannot mess up.\n>> Okay. Well, I don't know why I'm getting\nthese results here, but it says the\nlearning curve is really difficult. It\nhas a GVM depend because I entered why\nyou should not use pickle.\n>> That's actually a very good answer. U\nyeah that that's that's very good\nanswer. like but yeah you're right it\ndoes require JVM but uh you know I can\nlook past that\nand it it does have a learning curve but\nlike oh my god I mean\n>> it's enhance safety and maintainability\nit's reduced duplication it's\nabstraction of modality to me pickle\nsounds like JSON net like why why should\nI use pickle and not JSON net\n>> JSON is horrible when I last looked at\nit\n>> yeah so agree like I never really got\nJSON at properly. Um, so\n>> also very very both like pickle's very\ntight actually. It looks looks and reads\nvery nicely.\n>> Uh,\n>> I may have to play with it. But I have\nmy my reason to get into Terra\nconstructs and Typescript was\nspecifically because TypeScript is\neverywhere. Uh, it's that's one of my my\nmy\ntenets in life\n>> but still but still\n>> the last five years\n>> I I I don't think I can get behind. I\nmean, I can maybe you're working with\nstartups, but I still think\n>> product teams maybe I've been working\nfor too many big companies and stuff.\n>> Product teams shouldn't be writing uh\nCDK. It's going to get crazy real quick.\n>> That's always like when I talk about\nthis is a standard reply. Startups\nshouldn't be writing CD like product\nengineers shouldn't be touching infra\ncode and\n>> I mean I mean startups and midsize\ncompanies I think it's actually pretty\nquite good but if you're like a large\nheavily regulated industry that's never\ngoing to fly\n>> and I I think at that point you don't\nask the product engineer to write it but\nyou give the platform engineer the right\ntools to build better extractions for\nthe pro for the product engineer. there\nbecause again like this is what we\ntalked about last time as well. There's\nthis deck CDK\nwhich gives you the ability to build a a\nstrict types like strongly typed schema\nYAML um interface or front end which\nPulumi also has which is like\n>> it reminds me of the the serverless\napplication.\n>> Oh yes like SLA SAML\n>> uh not SAML sorry SAM. Oh yeah.\nServerless applica. What is the end\nserver?\n>> I've been doing too much authorization\nand authentication.\n>> Yeah. So, so but but this is a bit\nfunny, right? Because it kind of like\ngives you the L2 con L2 or L3 construct\nas a YAML uh composition thing.\n>> Actually, I I love it. I love it. It\nworks for me like uh nine out of 10\ntimes.\n>> And and I think that's kind of the\nexperience that we can build on top of\nTerra constructs or CDKF. basically a\nfront end question right under the hood\nlike docker file is a front end they\ncompletely reworked uh docker as well\nlike docker file does is not the\nstandard like you can have different\nfront ends you can have a yaml front end\nyou can have an other front end because\nnow you're building actual proper\nprogramming objects that can you know\nbind themselves and evolve and can be\nconfigured differently you're not stuck\nwith static terraform modules that you\nthen have to bunch put a whole bunch of\ngo templating around because you're\nasking you're giving your engineers um a\nYAML interface to basically configure\nmodules under the hood. That's what I\nhear banks do, right? And and it's the\nsame with with Kubernetes. That's\nexactly what Helm is. You're just\nputting Go templating around bunch of\nYAML, which is Kubernetes um resource\ndefinitions or manifests, right? And and\nand\nwe see where that goes. We see a Helm\nchart with like a values.yamel where you\nhave no idea how that gets, you know,\ninterpolated by the gold templates under\nthe hood. The gold templates are\nextremely complicated with like\n>> well\n>> too much logic within the template\nengine.\n>> That's why I showed you that Terraform\nproject that I was cooking up the other\nday because because I use pickle and and\nwhen you run it through pickle you can\nsee the pickle schema. You can see your\npickle. You can see how it it it becomes\nTerraform JSON. But why do I have to\nlearn a new language when Typescript is\nalready a TypeScript compiler that gives\nme strong typing and capabilities like\nPickle except I don't have to learn\nPickle and I can just run TypeScript.\n>> Well, the thing that I like about it is\nthat it's clear to me\nwhat\nwhat is the entry point into Terraform\nwhen I'm writing in Pickle. It's it's\nvery it's clear as day. But if you're\nwriting CDK\nuh and using Terra constructs, then then\nyou you really don't know what the\nTerraform resources are going to look\nlike until the\n>> No, that's not the same thing as what\nyou just started the sentence with. You\nsaid you you you know the entry point\nand then you say you don't know what's\ngoing to look like. That is a very\ndifferent\nI know the entry point when I use CDK. I\nknow exactly how this is going to get\ninvoked uh because I have a strongly\ntyped interface now that is defined\nunder TypeScript and TypeScript compiles\nto JSON schema. So I can expose that\ntyped interface as a with a JSON schema\non top of a YAML file and then my\nengineers can write YAML uh except they\nget an error message if they don't put\nthe field in the right place or if they\nhave a typo or if they put misplace a a\nspace. Maybe you get the same with\npickle because you get a strongly typed\npickle file or pickle config. But you\nget exactly the same with TypeScript.\nYou can expose it as a JSON schema and\nyou can allow people to provide config\nfiles and you can control the entry\npoints.\n>> Okay. Okay. I I might have misspoke here\nbut what I'm trying to say is that the\nthe translation is is more is more uh\nstraightforward in my mind because\n>> but then you're not dealing with\ncomplicated terapform configurations.\nYou're probably I I need to know exactly\nwhat is a terapform configuration.\n>> Yeah. I mean, am I rec\nI'm just I'm just mapping it into a\nmodule and you're right when you when\nyou in your example when you're messing\naround with API gateway or or lambda\n>> which is a realistic cloud because you\njust cloud workloads because what you\njust said this is what we all use and\nterapform modules are horrible at it and\nthen you're going to have to write\npickle to wrap the horrible terapform\nexperience which is very limited because\nit only has like 40 different variable\ninputs the outputs are not even typed\nyou write pickle again to do that. But\nhow about we go back to the source? How\nabout we build a proper L2 construct and\nthen we they know how to bind each\nother. And this example here, these 230\nlines of Terraform is not to tell you\nlike this is what you're going to work\nwith. This is to show you the complexity\nand the ugliness of what's under the\nhood.\n>> This is what you write.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And this is a well-known pattern because\nthis is actually the AWS CDK pattern.\nThis is literally the CDK workshop\nexample except it's on my landing page\nand now it spits out terraform.\nI I think it I think it it definitely\nmakes sense to empower product teams,\nbut I I I keep on going back to the to\nthe thought that in a in a heavy\nregulated company, you you would have to\njust give them a very locked down uh\n>> Yeah. And that's where a platform team\nwould need to build using these\nconstructs instead of these modules\nactually with a proper programming\nlanguage.\n>> Um they would be able to build what they\nneed.\n>> Okay. So the platform team uses terror\nconstructs to create the golden paths\n>> for example. Yes. Um like the pattern\nhere that I showed on the other slide uh\nwhich was\nI'm allowing my teams to deploy onto\nFargate and we use an application load\nbalancer. In our case the application\nload balancer is part of the landing\nzone. So they must import it using from\napplication load balancer attributes.\nMaybe I can wrap all of that up in as my\nsample app. um you know Typescript\ninterface. So you must provide the\nnecessary attributes to import the load\nbalancer, the VPC and the cluster. And\nthis is a strongly typed interface of\nwhat are my my integration points?\n>> Okay. And then how complete is Terra\nConstructs? Do you do you support like\neverything CDK throws at it or is it\nlike some\n>> No, no, no. So, so I started with like\nevery single AWS module that is in AWS\nCDK and more moving it over into on top\nof Terraform and that's been very\nmanual. Then I also used LLMs to\nautomate that process. But I still need\nto write all of the unit tests. I need\nto write all of the integration tests. I\nneed to validate everything.\n>> So just you're just getting started sort\nof thing. I mean\n>> like a year getting started. Um, so at\nthis point I I I'm focused on building\nthe the features that I need at my\norganization, right? Um, what what I\nwant\n>> that's a great slide deck actually. I\nreally like that.\n>> Yeah. What what I want\nat this point if people are interested\nthey should reach out and they say like\ngreat we use Fargate a lot. I don't see\nFargate right now. Like this pattern\nthat I show here it's a little asterisk\nat the bottom there. pending the ECS\npattern module public release. So this\nis not in Terra construct integrated\nyet. I need to make that public.\n>> Just just very quickly why why Fargate\ninstead of uh serverless? It just there\nneeded to be persistent.\n>> We use a lot of serverless at at my\norganization and um at some point\nthere's longunning job like services\nthat you need to run and better to run\nthem in containers\n>> without the whole Kubernetes\n>> um complexity. So we use Terraform a\nlot.\n>> I'm with you. I'm with you. Kubernetes\nis such a nightmare.\n>> So it's very funny because when we met,\nI was running the Docker and Kubernetes\nmeetups and you would tell me like why\ndon't you just use Compose? It's so much\nsimpler. And I would be like Compose\ndoesn't have all the dials and knobs\nthat you need and Kubernetes is like\nproperly designed and easy.\n>> This this must have been years ago.\n>> Yeah. 2017 maybe. Yeah. Well, oh, well,\nthat's back when uh what was that? Core\nOS. I love core OS. Don't know what\nhappened to it.\n>> They were acquired by IBM. Now there's a\nflat car Linux. It was fully integrated.\nNo, they were acquired by Redhead and\nRedhead was acquired by IBM, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, so Coras was acquired by\nRedhead. All of the core OS projects\nsuch as tectonic were integrated within\nopen shift and then they replaced like\nthe CentOS or whatever the Redhead\ncontainer Linux became was rebranded\nCoros really really so all of the\nCororez like um systemd integrations\nwhich ultimately systemd is a redhead\nproject as well right um core was 100%\nbuilt on top of systemd\n>> so the so so then some of the original\ncororos people that were not part of the\nacquisition or some people involved with\nthe project created flat car Linux. I\ndon't know where that went, but um today\num Talos is super interesting because\nthey're they're taking this whole like\nexposing the the the Linux\nadministration\nsurface completely through the API,\nwhich was another OS also had this idea.\nI don't know if it was Talos, but there\nwas another one doing the same thing.\n>> Not sure what what Talos is. Sounds like\na security product.\n>> Uh Talos. Talos. Talos.\nBut anyway, just to to defend my Oh, you\nknow what it is. Yeah, and I think I\nknow what it is. Yeah.\n>> Yeah, they just have a new landing zone\nuh landing page. Sorry.\n>> They expose\n>> But going going back to my going back I\nI don't remember talking to you about\nDocker Compose, but I think actually\nDocker Compose is one of those\ntechnologies that I I still regularly\nuse and love.\n>> Oh yes, absolutely. It's just when when\nDocker tried to take it and replace it\nwith Swarm, right? They they like,\n>> \"Oh that was a show.\"\n>> No, nobody liked Swarm. Um, so so yeah,\ndoctor time with it.\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay. I think we need to somehow end\nthis uh because I'm uh but I\n>> getting tired running out of time.\n>> I did really really enjoy this. I think\nwe covered a lot of things. I think\nmaybe I'm in the right. Okay, one more\nthing.",

It's a bit of a\n[0:23] slow burn. I hope you enjoy it. like the\n[0:26] video. Um, and I recommend listening\n[0:29] this to this in in a car. You don't need\n[0:32] to look at the screen. I I did capture\n[0:35] an angle of me from the side, which I\n[0:37] think is a bit unflattering. Uh, so you\n[0:40] don't need to watch this. We we do try\n[0:43] share the the screen and browse to the\n[0:46] things that we talk about, but\n[0:47] essentially I feel this is a podcast\n[0:50] format. You don't need to watch the\n[0:52] video, but the video helps. Do please\n[0:55] enjoy and comment below.\n[0:58] >> See you.\n[0:58] >> Why did I rebuild it? I probably didn't\n[1:00] even need to rebuild it. Okay, so the\n[1:02] value on top of Terapform. Um last time\n[1:04] we talked about a lot of drama around\n[1:06] the cloud providers and the way that you\n[1:08] manage Terraform state and the resource\n[1:11] under um under management pricing that's\n[1:14] exuberant and then some drama around\n[1:16] some open source projects and I'm very\n[1:18] excited about them because I have my own\n[1:20] open source project which is focused on\n[1:22] strongly typed terraform right um\n[1:26] originally terraform\n[1:28] >> I mean just to interrupt you I mean like\n[1:30] terraform is pretty typed I mean you\n[1:33] have your strings, you have your default\n[1:36] values, you have your\n[1:37] >> strings,\n[1:38] >> strings for enum values.\n[1:40] >> Uh, okay. You have strings, strings,\n[1:41] strings. No, you have um I'm sure you\n[1:43] have integers. I'm I'm sure.\n[1:45] >> No, no, but the problem is\n[1:47] >> you have reg x you have uh you have\n[1:50] stuff, right?\n[1:51] >> Yeah. So, Terraform basically\n[1:54] is built on the concept of plugins or\n[1:58] providers for a for clouds and cloud or\n[2:01] for pro for SAS or whatever services\n[2:05] cloud services that give you an API\n[2:07] where you can create resources such as\n[2:09] AWS creates gives you an EC2 API where\n[2:11] you can create an EC2 uh resource,\n[2:13] right? And that was very good and well\n[2:16] um you know 10 years ago where you just\n[2:18] needed to create a VPC couple of subnets\n[2:20] an instance or an autoscaling group and\n[2:22] the number of knobs and dials that you\n[2:24] could configure were not that much but\n[2:26] then you start to having like life cycle\n[2:28] hoots on autoscaling groups that works\n[2:30] with lambdas and you have SNS topics and\n[2:32] you have a lot of different services and\n[2:34] different integration patterns between\n[2:36] them right the cloud became way more\n[2:38] complex uh a lot more serverless is now\n[2:40] being part of a lot of the tech stack\n[2:43] And Terraform is originally just a\n[2:45] config file and a lot of programmatic\n[2:47] features were completely omitted. So\n[2:49] they tried to keep it dumb. They tried\n[2:50] to keep it as simple as possible to\n[2:52] avoid people shooting themselves in the\n[2:54] foot. Most of the time when you talk to\n[2:56] people about using actual programming\n[2:59] actual programming language for for um\n[3:02] cloud configuration, they say like that\n[3:05] is a mistake. Like um what are you doing\n[3:07] that requires a programming language?\n[3:09] you should stick to the the proven path\n[3:12] >> like a more declarative style of uh\n[3:15] >> yeah declarative way of of doing things.\n[3:17] But then they introduce for each. Then\n[3:18] they introduce list comprehensions. Then\n[3:20] they introduce local blocks. And then\n[3:22] you look at the Terraform AWS community\n[3:24] module that has like 45 different\n[3:26] variables for input and and like five of\n[3:30] them need to be set in a specific way to\n[3:33] that trickles down through different\n[3:35] local blocks with different tertiary\n[3:37] conditionals that then need to value\n[3:39] like that go down ultimately in one\n[3:41] resource configuration and then you\n[3:43] don't even know how those variables\n[3:44] interact. Speaking speaking of\n[3:46] complexity, I mean I always thought\n[3:48] serverless was a godsend because it's\n[3:50] going to uh simplify\n[3:53] uh deployment of um of uh of application\n[3:58] code, simplify the you know the life\n[4:01] cycle, simplify\n[4:03] uh everything to do with with that sort\n[4:06] of stuff. For some reason um in\n[4:08] Terraform at least provisioning a lambda\n[4:11] is just a nightmarish uh I wonder why\n[4:16] like why is that? How come Terraform\n[4:19] never managed to make lambda versioning\n[4:22] simple\n[4:24] >> because Terraform's\n[4:26] provider is built on the bare minimum\n[4:28] resources to cover the API. So you go\n[4:31] into very granular level to you know to\n[4:33] to set up a lambda you must configure\n[4:36] the lambda permission resource you must\n[4:38] configure the IM role you must couple it\n[4:40] and bind it to the lambda\n[4:42] >> so there was no good uh there was no\n[4:43] good abstraction or something um\n[4:45] >> so the the abstraction in terraform is a\n[4:48] terapform module which is very limited\n[4:51] in the way that you can configure it. It\n[4:53] provides a fat set of variable inputs\n[4:56] and it provides some outputs and there's\n[4:59] no guarantee around the type system of\n[5:00] the output at all. Like the outputs are\n[5:02] any they can be maps, they can be lists,\n[5:04] they can be strings, they change if you\n[5:06] depending on the internal of the module.\n[5:08] If you decide to put a count inside the\n[5:10] resource and then you use those outputs\n[5:12] uh or those attributes in an output,\n[5:14] then suddenly those outputs become a\n[5:16] list and you know for some reason\n[5:18] because under the hood something\n[5:19] changed, right? Yeah, that's inherent to\n[5:20] how terrible modules are developed.\n[5:23] >> Actually, I mean my usage of of of\n[5:26] serverless is generally quite\n[5:29] >> what what do you call it? uh\n[5:30] standardized\n[5:32] >> you know I usually just run a go binary\n[5:34] but I guess that's the trouble with\n[5:36] serverless is that you can do you can\n[5:38] you can do a lot with serverless you can\n[5:40] integrate it in lots of different ways\n[5:42] right\n[5:42] >> well so the great thing about serverless\n[5:44] is that you you're able to configure\n[5:47] very expressive business logic across\n[5:50] cloud resources but that's also\n[5:52] immediately why it becomes so complex\n[5:54] right because now your business logic is\n[5:56] spread across your serverless components\n[5:58] and if you work with something like\n[6:00] Terraform, those components are very\n[6:02] low-level resources that all need to be\n[6:04] configured exactly right for your actual\n[6:06] business logic to work.\n[6:07] >> I mean I mean\n[6:08] >> think about like a simple lambda\n[6:10] chaining setup where you have lambda.\n[6:12] >> Yeah.\n[6:13] >> Yeah. I I want to definitely get away\n[6:15] from that because my my usage of of of\n[6:18] serverless and is to is to essentially\n[6:21] run my monolithic application.\n[6:23] Like for me serverless is like a way\n[6:26] better uh ECS\n[6:30] But of course that doesn't work. I guess\n[6:33] that is the crux of the problem with\n[6:34] with lambda because yeah you can get\n[6:36] chaining, you can get uh distributed\n[6:39] systems, you can get microservices,\n[6:41] you can get all sorts of things with\n[6:42] lambda and then of course the complexity\n[6:45] explodes.\n[6:46] >> That's right. And the complexity\n[6:49] explodes not only just because of how\n[6:52] your business logic gets like trickled\n[6:54] down across all of your cloud resources\n[6:56] um but also because of how these cloud\n[6:59] resources are spread across different\n[7:01] services of the cloud provider. For\n[7:02] example in AWS you have a cloudatch\n[7:05] service you have a uh where you define\n[7:07] your logging groups and then your\n[7:08] permissions of your lambda must be\n[7:10] configured to write to those logging\n[7:11] groups. So that's an integration between\n[7:13] two different services. you have your S3\n[7:14] bucket where you have to have your\n[7:16] lambda notification like settings done\n[7:18] or you use event bridge where you have\n[7:19] to have like event bridge rules that\n[7:21] then need to be capturing the right\n[7:23] event fields that you want to propagate\n[7:25] towards the lambdas. So the main problem\n[7:27] is the integration across the different\n[7:29] services and you know how to bind them\n[7:32] together and that's where AWS does like\n[7:35] solves it really well\n[7:36] >> but lambda and cloudatch should be a uh\n[7:40] what do you call it a fixed pattern or\n[7:42] something like that\n[7:45] >> it changes a lot and and and it's funny\n[7:47] because sometimes\n[7:49] it could be very simple like you have a\n[7:52] situation where you want a lambda to be\n[7:55] triggered on an event bridge rule and\n[7:57] you can simply go to the lambda and say\n[7:59] async config and then say on success and\n[8:02] then it will you know trigger another\n[8:04] lambda or something else right and if\n[8:06] you do a very simple like lambda\n[8:07] chaining and you can do that directly on\n[8:09] the lambda resource it works until you\n[8:12] have a use case and that's a very fixed\n[8:13] pattern but then you have a use case\n[8:15] where now when the lambda success\n[8:17] happens you want to extract some field\n[8:19] from the um success event like you need\n[8:22] to get the actual um I don't know result\n[8:26] field from the ext JSON of that success\n[8:28] event and you want to get the extract\n[8:31] the payload like extract a certain\n[8:33] payload then suddenly you can't do that\n[8:35] with async evoke that's not possible\n[8:37] with the way that the the lambda API\n[8:39] works and you must use event bridge\n[8:40] rules so you're very use like very\n[8:43] simple pattern of like integrating two\n[8:45] things together which should always be\n[8:47] the same thing no longer works because\n[8:49] now you have an event bridge rules that\n[8:50] like match messes up your whole like\n[8:53] situation because you need to parse the\n[8:55] payload of the event and get out one\n[8:58] field. And that's an example that I\n[9:00] learned because I wrote a library to to\n[9:02] implement um these integration patterns\n[9:06] from AWS CDK on top of Terraform. And so\n[9:08] I saw that like this is very this is an\n[9:11] integration test actually that they have\n[9:12] on their Lambda function integration. Um\n[9:15] >> okay. Okay.\n[9:16] >> Yeah. So\n[9:17] >> I can show you the the actual running\n[9:19] code for that.\n[9:20] >> Okay. So so you're just showing some\n[9:22] Lambda REST API. That's actually quite\n[9:25] interesting because uh we we we use that\n[9:28] a lot at work.\n[9:30] >> Yeah. So so that's where the reality of\n[9:32] the cloud today is that people are using\n[9:34] these type of patterns more and more and\n[9:36] and that's also because you want to you\n[9:38] know leverage the cloud to accelerate\n[9:40] your business feature delivery. So you\n[9:42] can't be like completely decoupled from\n[9:46] the cloud. You start to be really\n[9:47] ingrained and integrated with the cloud\n[9:49] features. Even though a lot of original\n[9:51] cloud adoption was like we want to be\n[9:52] cloud agnostic, Kubernetes is great. The\n[9:55] reality is even if you use Kubernetes,\n[9:57] you're going to have a whole bunch of\n[9:58] custom resources just for AWS um to use\n[10:01] to to to integrate with the cloud that\n[10:03] you run. at at work we we love to use\n[10:05] the lambda rest API because because it\n[10:08] integrates with IM and then IM is the\n[10:11] way that we uh uh mediate govern uh\n[10:15] different APIs between different uh\n[10:18] teams and stuff and a lot of the things\n[10:20] in AWS is like the benefits is that\n[10:24] tight integration between services right\n[10:26] because like you just said IM is is a is\n[10:28] a really nice way to control permissions\n[10:31] across all of across all of for\n[10:33] resources. Um, and so yeah, but I I\n[10:37] pulled this up because this is kind of a\n[10:40] nice example and this is a great example\n[10:42] from originally when they released the\n[10:43] AWS CDK workshop um in how it simplifies\n[10:47] like try to imagine how you would do\n[10:48] this with terapform modules. You're\n[10:50] creating a function,\n[10:51] >> right? And and you're specifying here is\n[10:54] something very special already which is\n[10:55] the from asset. So this is actually\n[10:57] going to\n[10:58] >> this is a whole asset pipeline built in\n[11:00] right in there. It's going to take care\n[11:01] of bundling the code, you know, putting\n[11:03] it in S3, making sure that the lambda\n[11:05] can pick it up or you can, you know,\n[11:06] directly put the code in line. That's\n[11:08] something that you cannot imagine how to\n[11:10] build this with Terraform modules,\n[11:11] right? I mean, I know that there's an\n[11:13] attempt serverless.tf\n[11:16] to do this, but I mean, it's just it's\n[11:19] just a mistake and I'm sorry because I\n[11:22] know the people behind this uh and I try\n[11:24] to to to explain that, but yeah, they\n[11:28] have, you know, this their projects at\n[11:29] PET. So uh so anyway yeah so this whole\n[11:32] this one line already is an asset\n[11:33] pipeline and then this one right here\n[11:35] the lambda rest API is a special rest\n[11:37] API so this is object-oriented\n[11:39] programming and it's it's like an\n[11:41] extension it's just not a rest API it's\n[11:43] a lambda rest API that understands the\n[11:45] concept of a handler that is backed by a\n[11:47] function so this handler must implement\n[11:50] the function interface and then it knows\n[11:52] how to bind and automatically create the\n[11:54] the API gateway integration and back end\n[11:57] lender call right\n[11:59] >> yeah So, so, so just these lines\n[12:01] already. Um,\n[12:02] >> and you get all the LSP, you know, what\n[12:05] do you call it? Checking to make sure\n[12:07] that everything's there.\n[12:09] >> So, because this is an actual\n[12:11] programming language with enums and and\n[12:13] TypeScript is specifically built to add\n[12:16] typing on top of a non-type language\n[12:19] like JavaScript. So, it has a lot of\n[12:20] functionality to to inspect the type\n[12:22] schema and to to really be strong around\n[12:25] your typing. So you do get like indeed\n[12:27] like the from asset then it will the\n[12:30] handler with the I function and it's\n[12:31] strongly typed right.\n[12:33] >> Okay. So I I'm I think I know where\n[12:35] you're going with this. So you're not\n[12:36] talking just about primitive typing.\n[12:38] You're talking about like fun function\n[12:40] typing and such and so forth. I'm not\n[12:42] sure if that's the right terminology.\n[12:45] >> I'm also not sure about the terminology.\n[12:47] But what I'm trying to say is that if\n[12:49] you have the telephone provider you're\n[12:51] going to have a string. You say it's\n[12:52] very strongly typed, but yeah,\n[12:54] >> string has only like three possible\n[12:55] values. And when I'm building my\n[12:57] library, I'm actually have to go to the\n[12:59] EC2 or the Alumba um you know API docs\n[13:03] to figure out what are the valid values\n[13:05] because that's nowhere in Terraform,\n[13:07] >> right? And and they they they can't\n[13:10] really because they they need to cover\n[13:12] so many AWS services. It's manually\n[13:14] written as well. And I'm still relying\n[13:15] on the Terapform provider AWS except I'm\n[13:18] building the CDK library on top of it.\n[13:21] So, so this is the example from AWS CDK,\n[13:23] but now it's running on top of\n[13:25] terraform, right? So, I have the same\n[13:27] things. I have the code, the lambda\n[13:29] function, the lambda rest API. Um, for\n[13:31] some reason, I didn't call it function.\n[13:33] I called it lambda function. And that's\n[13:35] because I put everything under under one\n[13:37] name space. I put it all under AWS\n[13:39] compute, which maybe was a mistake, but\n[13:41] okay. Uh, and then I have the AWS asset\n[13:44] like the stack, the AWS stack, which is\n[13:46] a um extension of the classic Terraform\n[13:49] stack. This is a stack that understands\n[13:50] about AWS asset pipelines. So it knows\n[13:53] about ECR. It knows about S3. So it\n[13:55] knows that if you use and that's\n[13:57] necessary because when you use AWS CDK\n[14:00] it's built on top of AWS. It's built on\n[14:02] top of cloud form. So it has the ID of\n[14:05] asset pipeline and things like that. So\n[14:06] if I want to do this code from asset\n[14:08] here, I actually am building if I\n[14:11] synthesize this\n[14:13] >> I I actually have the S3 bucket. If I\n[14:17] don't pass in the bucket to the the\n[14:18] stack, it will create a bucket for me\n[14:20] and it will automatically upload my uh\n[14:24] lambda source code bundled up and put it\n[14:26] straight into my S3 bucket. Now some\n[14:28] people when you are doing terraform\n[14:30] they'd be like no your your code\n[14:31] delivery must be decoupled right on one\n[14:33] side terraform stand up the the skeleton\n[14:35] and on the other side you have your\n[14:36] actual code that needs to be built and\n[14:38] and deployed. But when you're in the\n[14:40] serverless world the resources and your\n[14:43] actual business logic are very tightly\n[14:45] coupled. That's so true. That's so true.\n[14:48] So I think the next question in my brain\n[14:50] was that okay you create a bucket for\n[14:52] the for the sourcing your your\n[14:55] application code but like what happens\n[14:57] when you destroy that with the bucket go\n[15:01] >> uh or yes or do\n[15:03] >> so this is your terraform under the hood\n[15:05] right um there is yeah the the terraform\n[15:08] call because the bucket is the object is\n[15:11] also managed by terraform so terapform\n[15:13] will first delete the object then if the\n[15:15] buck then it will delete the bucket AWS\n[15:18] will prevent that\n[15:19] >> if there's still some some objects\n[15:21] inside then it will not allow it.\n[15:23] >> Okay. So, so you're saying that\n[15:25] Terraform will completely handle all the\n[15:27] objects inside there I suppose.\n[15:30] >> Yeah. So, so this is purely translating\n[15:32] the AWS CDK on a deep deep level\n[15:35] directly to Terraform resources and not\n[15:37] just any resources but the actual\n[15:39] Terraform provider AWS resources. That\n[15:41] means that all of your existing like\n[15:43] terraform linting um you know code code\n[15:45] scanning everything still works. Cool.\n[15:47] And then and then another question\n[15:48] because uh C CDK I believe has this\n[15:52] bootstrap uh functionality where it does\n[15:54] create its own bucket for the stack up\n[15:57] >> right.\n[15:58] >> Yeah. So I don't I don't do that. Um no\n[16:01] my AWS stack has like a it's called like\n[16:04] a singleton pattern. It will create an\n[16:06] S3 bucket if it's necessary. You can\n[16:08] pass it in directly to the AWS stack as\n[16:10] u stack as well. So when you invoke this\n[16:13] like my CDK workshops tag when I call\n[16:15] the constructor if I in the constructor\n[16:18] properties pass in my own bucket then it\n[16:20] will take that one right\n[16:22] >> this is again\n[16:23] >> the power of actual you know I mean a\n[16:27] lot of people hate on object-oriented\n[16:28] programming but the ability to define\n[16:30] like to use the basic object of a\n[16:32] terapform stack and then extend it with\n[16:33] functionality just reuse the constructor\n[16:35] and have this capabilities built in\n[16:37] makes it so much nicer like you can't\n[16:39] really do that with terapform modules or\n[16:41] like bundling terapform models on top of\n[16:42] each other. Right.\n[16:43] >> Right. Right. But like Okay. So if you\n[16:45] had the option to use the CDK bootstrap,\n[16:49] you didn't that's obviously just not a\n[16:51] default here like by default.\n[16:52] >> Yeah. No, the CDK bootstrap does a lot.\n[16:54] And the actual asset pipeline from AWS\n[16:57] CDK is built into the CDK CLI. So it's\n[17:00] not a cloud for thing. The AWS CDK CLI\n[17:04] has the idea of uh bundling code and um\n[17:08] putting it into a staging directory and\n[17:10] then preparing a manifest of what is\n[17:12] inside the staging directory that needs\n[17:14] to go into S3, what needs to go into\n[17:15] ECR. So that's what the CLI does.\n[17:18] Terraform kind of like worked around\n[17:20] that by providing special provider\n[17:22] functions. So it doesn't like Terraform\n[17:24] doesn't understand or doesn't care about\n[17:25] AWS asset pipeline, right? But you do\n[17:28] have the ability to create like use a\n[17:29] terapform provider to create an S3\n[17:31] bucket and upload an S3 object. So I'm\n[17:34] kind of offloading that asset pipeline\n[17:36] to native Terapform provider\n[17:38] capabilities which I'm not sure if it's\n[17:40] the best way but it does allow me to\n[17:42] like hand off the life cycle completely\n[17:44] to Terraform\n[17:45] >> the way that it does.\n[17:46] >> Yeah.\n[17:46] >> Okay.\n[17:47] >> Those are all conscious decisions as\n[17:49] well.\n[17:49] >> There's a there's a lot of details in\n[17:51] here too. So so say a company's using\n[17:54] CDK. Um,\n[17:56] >> but let's be honest, I think we talked\n[17:58] about this before. CDK got there um is\n[18:01] great, but it it's only 80% of the way\n[18:03] there. Like it and and correct me if I'm\n[18:06] wrong, like this the support from CDK on\n[18:09] the AWS side seems a bit weak right at\n[18:12] the moment or do you think they'll come\n[18:14] back into it or like what?\n[18:16] >> So that's interesting to hear. Um\n[18:18] >> I'm trying to I'm trying to like map the\n[18:20] future of CDK\n[18:23] >> for me is a pivotal tool for or\n[18:27] developer tooling for AWS to hear that\n[18:29] they I know that they've withdrawn some\n[18:31] of the stuff um but they are still\n[18:33] actively developing it like they they\n[18:35] added the C the CDK refactoring for\n[18:38] refactoring stacks across was integrated\n[18:41] directly I mean the cloud formation\n[18:42] refactoring feature was was integrated\n[18:44] completely into the CDK. You can\n[18:46] refactor stacks now through the CDK CLI.\n[18:48] They added an API or like a programmatic\n[18:51] way to call the AWS CDK as well. So they\n[18:53] are developing and adding more features.\n[18:55] >> Okay. So what does what is sorry what\n[18:56] does refactoring actually mean in in the\n[18:59] in CDK?\n[19:00] >> Yeah. So in the in the world of\n[19:01] Terraform or in the world of\n[19:03] infrastructure as code, the moment you\n[19:04] that you start treating your AWS\n[19:06] resources as code, um you must be able\n[19:10] to do things that are you know very\n[19:12] common with code. And I can give you an\n[19:13] example for you may start with one\n[19:16] project and you create a network and you\n[19:17] create a database and you create a\n[19:19] cluster or you create something like\n[19:21] that and then you deploy your web\n[19:22] application. You're running a whole\n[19:24] Kubernetes cluster for your blog, right?\n[19:26] I'm just kidding. H but then you decide\n[19:29] that you know you need to start a second\n[19:31] project and you don't want project two\n[19:33] to completely depend on all the all of\n[19:35] the resources that belong to project\n[19:36] one, right? because one day maybe you\n[19:37] want to deprecate project one and you\n[19:39] want to um you know get rid of it and\n[19:42] then project two depends on half of the\n[19:43] resources. So at that point you must\n[19:46] move those shared resources maybe to a\n[19:48] shared layer or a shared ownership. So\n[19:51] maybe there becomes a platform team to\n[19:53] maintain the the network and the\n[19:54] kubernetes cluster and then you have the\n[19:56] different product teams that deploy on\n[19:58] top of it and integrate within it. So\n[20:00] you asked me what re what refactoring\n[20:02] was, right? And I just said that I think\n[20:04] refactoring is a very central part of\n[20:06] infrastructure.\n[20:06] >> Okay, I I got that. So okay, I for some\n[20:10] reason I had I think you we were talking\n[20:12] about it a couple of weeks ago that like\n[20:13] you know the CDK the original AWS CDK\n[20:16] team um I can't remember the the name of\n[20:19] the guy who who Israel. Yeah.\n[20:21] >> Yeah. He went on to to do wing lang but\n[20:25] that didn't that didn't fly\n[20:27] >> reasons about it. A lot of the comments\n[20:29] I saw was it's too early. Um people are\n[20:31] not ready for this.\n[20:32] >> I I never really got into it. Um um\n[20:37] though, yeah. So in my mind, I thought\n[20:39] to myself, okay, so CDK doesn't have its\n[20:42] uh you know, BNFL.\n[20:44] Is that the right word? I don't know. It\n[20:46] doesn't have its uh have a direction\n[20:49] now. Uh so um and\n[20:51] >> I know that a lot of the original core\n[20:53] members have moved on but there's still\n[20:56] a very large community and I think most\n[20:58] of the projects I know that AWS uses it\n[21:01] heavily internally like half the time\n[21:03] when I look at like progen or\n[21:05] bootstrapping or for example the PDK um\n[21:08] kit\n[21:10] >> okay so they're using it um\n[21:13] >> when I look at the features and the\n[21:14] issues the GitHub issues I see people I\n[21:17] work at this service team at AWS and we\n[21:18] have this problem and this is how this\n[21:20] would help.\n[21:20] >> AWS project to make it. What is that?\n[21:24] >> Oh, this is an a really cool um\n[21:27] what I like about this is that it\n[21:30] includes like highle graph generation\n[21:33] and which is another thing that I I\n[21:35] believe is something that Terraform is\n[21:37] horrible at and also because of the way\n[21:39] that Terraform modules work.\n[21:40] >> You can generate diagrams from CDK.\n[21:43] >> Yeah. So there is a project called CDK\n[21:45] DIA and and the thing is because you\n[21:48] know how these objects these constructs\n[21:50] they they they contain like a lot of\n[21:52] highle uh like intent and and meaning\n[21:56] right so they actually capture what they\n[21:59] represent. So you can pres represent\n[22:00] those in into logos nicely in here.\n[22:04] >> Wow I can decorate your constructs.\n[22:06] >> I need this at work. Wow. uh but but\n[22:10] >> so there's an I inspectable interface\n[22:11] that you need you can implement to to\n[22:13] basically say how you want your\n[22:15] construct to be shown on the diagram\n[22:18] which you can't even imagine to do\n[22:19] something like that with terraform\n[22:22] >> this is fascinating so so so basically\n[22:25] this PDK is is some\n[22:28] >> not just that it it has thread like\n[22:30] plug-in thread composer it's integrated\n[22:32] with cloudscape react ts website so you\n[22:35] can you know build a their design system\n[22:38] setup up cloud cloudfront um you know do\n[22:41] your CDN um\n[22:42] >> what the hell does cloudscape react\n[22:44] supposed to mean\n[22:45] >> it's a system design um sorry not system\n[22:48] design it's a design system from AWS\n[22:50] that's how they build their dashboards\n[22:52] and their components\n[22:53] >> oh interesting\n[22:53] >> as far as I understood cloudscape\n[22:55] >> okay so okay so CDK still has a lot of\n[22:57] buying because I mean sorry like\n[22:59] >> I'm telling you it's a whole world and\n[23:01] and\n[23:02] >> because I I I mean yeah to be honest at\n[23:07] work clients are for example this client\n[23:11] I'm working with\n[23:12] >> has been using CDK and to be honest\n[23:16] >> it's been fine I mean I I can get behind\n[23:18] it there's some quality of things that I\n[23:21] hate about CDK like it doesn't seem to\n[23:23] be able to plan\n[23:26] >> so that's why Terra constructs would be\n[23:27] great\n[23:29] >> yeah uh so um but besides that um one of\n[23:34] the one of the technologies that they\n[23:36] bought bought into is a is a database\n[23:39] and the the only official uh\n[23:43] >> provider is\n[23:44] >> provider is terraform. So they're\n[23:46] basically\n[23:46] >> those are all cloud form limitations.\n[23:48] >> So basically they're stuck because they\n[23:50] have to they have to start using\n[23:52] terraform. So at the moment their\n[23:54] pipeline like looks like you know CDK\n[23:57] deploy and then do your Terraform um\n[23:59] applying cool beans but but of course\n[24:03] the question in my mind is like okay we\n[24:05] can't just keep on using CDK and keep uh\n[24:08] and then and then use Terraform as a\n[24:11] baseline. We have to think about like\n[24:14] >> aligning things.\n[24:15] >> Yeah, aligning things. So, so I and\n[24:19] yeah, we talked about it before, I'm\n[24:20] sure, but like I think Terraform is the\n[24:23] the de facto winner of the day when it\n[24:25] comes to IA probably for the next god\n[24:28] knows how many years\n[24:30] >> mainly due to adoption.\n[24:32] >> Yeah. Um\n[24:33] >> yeah so\n[24:35] >> I say that and yeah so so where does CDK\n[24:38] fit in with this the fact that Terraform\n[24:41] is is definitely not going away\n[24:43] >> and it's got that sort of mind share uh\n[24:45] you know\n[24:46] >> so at some organizations I worked\n[24:48] >> the expectation was that the team\n[24:50] decides what they want to use if they\n[24:52] want to use CDK they can the platform\n[24:54] team had three years of platform team\n[24:57] stuff so we were bootstrapping VPCs EKS\n[25:00] clusters everything with with Terraform\n[25:02] And so we just had to provide\n[25:04] integration points that is kind of\n[25:06] painful for um because you now have to\n[25:10] deal with like different execution\n[25:11] engines you know cloud formation and so\n[25:13] on. It can work if the team takes full\n[25:15] ownership of their CDK stack. Um but the\n[25:19] moment yeah I've also had experiences\n[25:21] where a team has full ownership on their\n[25:23] stack and then half the team leaves and\n[25:25] one guy is left to maintain it and he\n[25:27] was supposed to like work on really cool\n[25:29] data engineering stuff and now he has to\n[25:30] maintain an airflow cluster and he hates\n[25:32] it. This sounds very accurate like too\n[25:36] many details like where does that come\n[25:37] from?\n[25:38] >> Yeah. Uh I know what you mean with\n[25:39] airflow. I mean the whole MWA airflow\n[25:42] 3.0 I don't know if you know about that.\n[25:44] That's amaz\n[25:45] >> I haven't used it for the last five\n[25:46] years.\n[25:47] >> Okay. Well, there's there's basically no\n[25:49] upgrade path between two and three,\n[25:51] which makes life fun and interesting.\n[25:53] Uh,\n[25:55] >> LLM upgrade path.\n[25:57] >> Yeah. So, LLM upgrade. Um,\n[26:01] yeah. Okay. So, I guess I guess what\n[26:03] you're saying is that CDK and Terraform\n[26:05] can live side by side. Then sorry where\n[26:07] does Ter I thought when when you\n[26:09] introduced to me terror constructs to me\n[26:11] I actually thought in the back of my\n[26:12] mind since because of that problem that\n[26:15] we have at work we have CDK we have\n[26:17] Terraform I thought you were like almost\n[26:20] gifting me the the perfect solution to\n[26:22] my problem uh to align everything to\n[26:25] Terraform\n[26:27] >> right so what terror constructs does at\n[26:30] this point um it's my effort to\n[26:34] translate the AWS CDK developer\n[26:37] experience on top of the core terraform\n[26:40] resources and provider model. Right? So\n[26:43] there are some projects um Hashi Cororp\n[26:46] created Terraform CDK to build the\n[26:49] foundation to automatically create\n[26:52] TypeScript classes that wrap the\n[26:54] original Terraform provider. So you can\n[26:55] configure your Terapform resources using\n[26:57] TypeScript or Golang or Python, right?\n[26:59] But Hashior never built the actual\n[27:02] system like service integration\n[27:04] patterns. it never built the IM um the\n[27:08] idea of of you know connecting IM. For\n[27:11] example, in this case when I when I bind\n[27:14] the lambda the handler on top of the\n[27:16] REST API, it automatically creates the\n[27:19] service role and gives the Lambda\n[27:22] service principle the ability to assume\n[27:24] that role like under the hood and it\n[27:27] also\n[27:28] >> creates\n[27:30] >> uh hold on. It also creates the Lambda\n[27:32] permission for the gateway. Yeah,\n[27:34] >> for the actual execute API gateway to\n[27:36] call that lambda and so on. So all of\n[27:38] that is is is built on top of the\n[27:40] service integration pattern between\n[27:42] lambda lambda API gateway and IM. So so\n[27:45] that those are patterns that exist in\n[27:48] AWS CDK.\n[27:49] >> So Terraform CDK never did\n[27:52] >> did that. But how but that that that to\n[27:56] me you're saying that you can't imple\n[27:58] you can't deploy a lambda with terraform\n[28:00] CDK then it's going to work\n[28:03] >> you you just have to write your your\n[28:05] very very nice and and small um Hashi\n[28:08] Cororp language config file now you have\n[28:10] to write a complex TypeScript program to\n[28:12] generate that config file which of\n[28:14] course a lot of people will say that why\n[28:16] would I use Terapform CDK. The idea is\n[28:19] that now that you have that TypeScript\n[28:20] object, you can build your own\n[28:22] abstractions and you can build your own\n[28:24] higher level constructs around it. But\n[28:26] there's no interest for Hashi Corp to\n[28:27] build that, right? They're not af Okay.\n[28:29] So, so they just got you bootstrapped\n[28:33] bootstrapped.\n[28:34] >> Yes, they got you bootstrapped.\n[28:35] >> So, surely the whole community must have\n[28:39] cropped up.\n[28:39] >> This there's a few like\n[28:43] attempts. So one of them is uh CDKTF\n[28:46] plus which was from the original people\n[28:49] behind CDKTF. So they tried to build\n[28:52] like a level two um library of of or\n[28:56] layer 2 construct library which is like\n[28:58] 3 years ago but this is pretty much\n[29:00] archived now. Um and they also built\n[29:03] something else which is called the AWS\n[29:04] CDK adapter where they automatically\n[29:08] they basically let AWS CDK do its job to\n[29:10] generate cloud for resources and then\n[29:12] map those cloudformation resources on\n[29:14] top of terraform provider resources.\n[29:16] Unfortunately that doesn't capture half\n[29:18] of the of the functionality that is\n[29:21] hidden between these objects interacting\n[29:23] with each other. like the way that you\n[29:26] generate resources on for cloud form is\n[29:29] different from the way that you generate\n[29:30] them for um for terform providers and\n[29:34] they try to use a common generated\n[29:37] autogenerated provider through the AWS\n[29:39] cloud control API. So the cloud control\n[29:41] API is an attempt to make available the\n[29:44] the engine behind cloud form. So you can\n[29:46] actually autogenerate the terform\n[29:48] provider from the cloud controller API\n[29:50] but it's like it's gong ga I think this\n[29:54] year uh or maybe was it last year I'm\n[29:56] losing track of the years been working\n[29:58] on this for a year.\n[29:59] >> Oh what do you mean gongji? What did\n[30:02] that word made?\n[30:02] >> So it was under beta for like two or\n[30:04] three years and then it went generally\n[30:05] available. So the project to the AWSCC\n[30:08] provider\n[30:08] >> because yeah because yeah like now that\n[30:10] you mention it cloud form to terraform\n[30:12] makes sense here because ultimately CDK\n[30:16] is producing cloudformation.\n[30:19] >> Yes. So they have an adapter but again\n[30:21] it doesn't capture some of these\n[30:23] patterns. So if you align the providers\n[30:25] then you should get the same\n[30:27] functionality but there's still a whole\n[30:31] bunch of like resources and patterns\n[30:33] that are not supported by this Terraform\n[30:35] provider. this autogenerated provider\n[30:37] and to use it like nobody's really using\n[30:40] it because when you look at these\n[30:41] resources you basically get like no the\n[30:45] good thing about Terraform is that when\n[30:46] you talk to an API object you can expand\n[30:49] a JSON schema into like very strongly\n[30:51] type like an expanded um schema in\n[30:54] terapform language right but in this\n[30:56] case the schema is not expanded like\n[30:59] let's go to the documentation and look\n[31:00] at some of these resources maybe take um\n[31:04] let's look at the AP API gateway\n[31:07] >> uh or maybe something simpler SNS or\n[31:09] something I don't\n[31:10] >> no no let's look at the API gateway\n[31:12] because that is a real resour\n[31:18] >> we talking\n[31:18] >> so here we we we have the um you have\n[31:22] the open API spec that you pass in\n[31:25] >> and then you have the deployment the\n[31:26] stage but what's missing is the\n[31:28] integration right like if you hit here\n[31:30] it's just doing a response\n[31:33] um but it's like it's an X X Amazon.\n[31:38] Anyway, this is this is not strongly\n[31:39] typed. This is just JSON. You end up\n[31:41] just shoving JSON all over the place.\n[31:44] >> Yeah. So, so this is the Wait a minute.\n[31:45] I\n[31:46] >> understand it though.\n[31:47] >> This project takes cloudformation and\n[31:50] generates it those resources. Is that's\n[31:52] what you're saying, right?\n[31:53] >> No, this is the cloud control generated\n[31:55] Terraform provider. So, there's two\n[31:57] providers for AWS. One is manually\n[31:59] written and maintained by people. Every\n[32:00] time AWS releases a new feature, adds a\n[32:02] new field, adds a new whatever to any\n[32:05] service, somebody gets, you know, a pull\n[32:07] request or somebody issue is created and\n[32:09] then it's added in\n[32:11] >> um manually and manually mapped. So a\n[32:15] lot of like decisions have been made to\n[32:17] do things a certain way which is like\n[32:18] completely different from the way cloud\n[32:20] form does it right.\n[32:21] >> Interesting. Okay.\n[32:22] >> Yeah. So the terraform provide AWS is\n[32:24] written by humans. That also means it's\n[32:27] kind of like a created experience\n[32:28] because it kind of tries to make sense\n[32:31] of where it expands things uh or how\n[32:33] does it expose certain configuration\n[32:36] fields. For example, the way that you\n[32:38] define um I think it's like on the again\n[32:43] because I did the API gateway conversion\n[32:45] recently there was uh the way that you\n[32:47] define the method responses on on an API\n[32:51] gateway. The way that the the actual API\n[32:54] endpoint works is with like a JSON patch\n[32:56] like you have one endpoint and you have\n[32:58] to like JSON patch in the differences\n[33:00] and in the provider they made a\n[33:02] different resource for each one of them\n[33:04] and when under the hood the provider\n[33:06] will build the JSON patch and send it to\n[33:08] that one endpoint to achieve what you're\n[33:10] trying to do. So this is the type of\n[33:12] stuff that they can do because of the\n[33:13] API endpoints that API gateway exposes\n[33:16] is very complex for a human to you know\n[33:19] build a JSON patch. uh and then cloud\n[33:21] for does a similar thing. It kind of\n[33:23] like like abstracts away this complexity\n[33:25] of that the way that API is built and\n[33:27] allows you to define it um in in one\n[33:29] resource. But in terapform provider AWS,\n[33:31] they made like many different resources\n[33:33] and the Golang code takes care of it\n[33:35] like building a nice little patch under\n[33:37] the hood. So the way that you write your\n[33:39] config is really nice. Um so that's the\n[33:40] advantage of a manual written uh\n[33:42] provider right compared to like an AWSCC\n[33:45] autogenerated provider. Um, but that\n[33:48] also means that most of the tooling like\n[33:50] uh code scanning and everything is\n[33:52] around this provider because everyone is\n[33:53] the one using it. Like all of the\n[33:55] Terraform linting, all of the Terraform\n[33:57] security scanning, all of the Terapform\n[33:58] cost calculation tooling is around this\n[34:01] provider because everyone's using this\n[34:02] provider.\n[34:03] >> Yeah, I mean that's top provider by like\n[34:05] a way a long way I'm sure.\n[34:08] >> Yes. I'm not sure about like I know some\n[34:10] people sometimes say like I we're using\n[34:12] AWS CCC because the feature has never\n[34:13] has not been built on top of the\n[34:15] manually maintained one and the CC one\n[34:17] has a chance to adopt features faster\n[34:18] because it's autogenerated.\n[34:20] >> And do you know how AWSCC works? I mean\n[34:22] they they must have a pipeline that\n[34:24] kicks off with uh\n[34:26] >> yeah they have a they have a lightweight\n[34:27] prox API to discover, provision and\n[34:29] manage cloud resources. So they they\n[34:31] autogenerate it. Um I guess it\n[34:33] >> the source of truth for um AWS if I\n[34:36] remember is like like a Mason schema or\n[34:38] something like that that describes the\n[34:40] APIs.\n[34:42] >> Yeah, there's that's part of the of the\n[34:43] PDK here as well. They they have the\n[34:45] type save API. Smitty smithy\n[34:47] >> Smitty.\n[34:48] >> Why did I say Mason?\n[34:50] >> Smith because Mason Smith's same thing.\n[34:53] >> Ah,\n[34:55] it must be Yes, it must be. Yes, you're\n[34:58] an LLM after all.\n[35:00] >> Cuz like 10 years ago, I was working on\n[35:02] uh in a video startup in Singapore. I'm\n[35:06] sure I don't know if you remember.\n[35:07] That's probably when we met. And\n[35:09] interestingly,\n[35:11] um the the service hadn't launched and\n[35:14] and AWS gave us like this JSON file that\n[35:16] was generated with Mason if I remember\n[35:19] correctly. I don't know why Mason, it's\n[35:20] probably the wrong word, but they gave\n[35:22] us a JSON file and then we just copied\n[35:24] it under the AWS CLI directory and then\n[35:27] all of a sudden we had all these\n[35:29] commands available to us, which I\n[35:30] thought was really cool.\n[35:32] >> Oh, I haven't heard about that. That's\n[35:34] sounds really cool. Um, but yeah, as far\n[35:37] as I know, Smithy is the the language\n[35:39] they use for API specifications or\n[35:41] definition.\n[35:43] >> Yeah. So, so that's a cool thing about\n[35:45] the like the AWS de project development\n[35:47] kit again because they have this like\n[35:49] REST API generation from Smithy. Um, and\n[35:52] this is how you build your your product.\n[35:54] Um, so it's kind of like uh build on top\n[35:56] of the AWS CDK to do that. But yeah, the\n[35:59] whole thing I was saying is that you\n[36:00] have different providers. Uh, one of\n[36:02] them is very popular but manually\n[36:04] maintained. The other one is\n[36:05] autogenerated but doesn't have the full\n[36:07] coverage. And I hear from people that\n[36:08] there's still quite a few errors or\n[36:10] problems that they're facing. But but\n[36:12] that almost doesn't that almost doesn't\n[36:14] make sense. Surely something that's\n[36:15] autogenerated has full coverage.\n[36:18] >> No, it didn't have full No, because the\n[36:20] cloud control API doesn't have full\n[36:21] coverage.\n[36:22] >> The thing that backs this Yes, it's the\n[36:25] control. If you go to the website for\n[36:27] the AWS control uh cloud control API, it\n[36:30] will tell you how much of their actual\n[36:32] services they do cover on this.\n[36:34] >> But that but that's I mean didn't Jeff\n[36:36] Bezel\n[36:36] >> because every team developed it's like a\n[36:38] two-piece pizza team in AWS, right? They\n[36:40] build their own services. Nobody did a\n[36:41] centralized cloud control API, so they\n[36:44] started building a centralized cloud\n[36:45] control API.\n[36:46] >> To me, it kind of makes sense.\n[36:48] >> Well, wait a minute. Like the the folk\n[36:50] law goes that Jeff Bezos mandated that\n[36:53] every service team uh publishes their\n[36:56] API. It sounds like they don't if if if\n[37:00] they can't if it can't be syndicated by\n[37:02] the cloud control API.\n[37:05] >> Let's look at a year old LLM summary.\n[37:10] Uh\n[37:13] ah see see for example the the\n[37:17] certificate uh doesn't support update.\n[37:19] Maybe that's simply because you can't do\n[37:21] that. But here's a little table for you\n[37:22] of the coverage. Maybe this is also\n[37:26] maybe this relates directly to the\n[37:27] coverage. Looks like it has quite a lot.\n[37:29] But where are the services not covered\n[37:31] though? This is anything that is\n[37:32] covered. Um I'm wondering if cl if local\n[37:36] stack is using this because they have a\n[37:38] very similar table. So local stack might\n[37:40] be using this to to generate their um\n[37:43] their local stack.\n[37:44] >> So just to reiterate what I think you're\n[37:47] saying to me, you're saying that the\n[37:48] Terraform uh AWS provider has more\n[37:52] coverage than something that was\n[37:54] autogenerated.\n[37:56] >> When they G8, the AWSCC, they put out a\n[37:59] number on the number of resources\n[38:01] covered. and it looked like it was the\n[38:05] same number, but when you looked into\n[38:06] it, it was actually a bunch of like a\n[38:10] split between some of the resources. Or\n[38:13] maybe I'm getting this wrong because the\n[38:14] Terraform provider AWS has special\n[38:16] resources that don't really have a\n[38:17] backing API. Um, but I I need to look\n[38:20] into it. They do have like that's\n[38:22] definitely something maybe we can add in\n[38:23] later as a clarification on how much is\n[38:26] the coverage actually of the FCC\n[38:28] provider. But there is a difference.\n[38:30] >> How did we even get here? Oh my god. We\n[38:32] talked about ter we talked about ter\n[38:34] constructs. We talked about why\n[38:36] >> we started with spec kit. We started we\n[38:38] started with spec kit and how it like\n[38:39] formalizes or gives you workflow to do\n[38:41] your LLM work like um development. We\n[38:44] talked about some evolution in the cloud\n[38:46] code budget thing. We talked about you\n[38:49] then asked me more about um like more\n[38:52] about to towards Terraform and why I\n[38:54] built something like Terra constructs. I\n[38:56] think so. I gave some examples about the\n[38:58] evolution of the cloud, the fact that it\n[39:00] changed and became so complex and that\n[39:02] the integration patterns between the\n[39:03] services are complex and therefore a\n[39:05] simple config file or terform module\n[39:07] doesn't do it anymore. So that's where\n[39:09] um I also give you examples of why the\n[39:11] AWS CDK is so great. We talked a little\n[39:13] bit about like it not really being\n[39:15] maintained but there's still being a lot\n[39:17] of new features being added. But but\n[39:19] with Terra Constructs, I thought I I saw\n[39:21] it as a way as as as migrating it. Now\n[39:25] that I'm speaking with you at length, it\n[39:27] sounds like you are not thinking like\n[39:30] that. You're thinking that you're going\n[39:32] to still leverage CDK, but your output\n[39:34] is going to be Terraform.\n[39:36] >> No. So, so there isn't an a project from\n[39:39] Hashi Cororp that puts uh a host service\n[39:43] a host um pro object around AWS CDK and\n[39:49] then encapsulates the process like when\n[39:51] AWS CDK generates something it then\n[39:53] generates the Terraform. I'm not doing\n[39:56] that. That's the adapter project and I\n[39:58] don't believe it can achieve the actual\n[40:01] functionality required. Okay. And we\n[40:03] talked and that's why we ended up\n[40:04] talking about AWS CC because it uses\n[40:06] that AWS CC provider that not so many\n[40:09] people use that you know doesn't have\n[40:11] all of this ecosystem tooling around it\n[40:13] and and that doesn't like allow you I I\n[40:16] believe like I talked to some people\n[40:18] behind the project and they told me that\n[40:20] it's really just for early stage\n[40:22] companies like quickly want to you know\n[40:24] prototype how moving towards Terapform\n[40:27] would help them maybe get them halfway\n[40:28] there like you know have existing AWS\n[40:31] CDK programs and put like a crud cr\n[40:33] grudge around it. So, so you understand\n[40:35] what I'm saying? It's called the AWS\n[40:36] adapter and um but it's not like a\n[40:41] long-term solution for um\n[40:45] for your\n[40:48] Yeah, it's called the AWS adapter for\n[40:50] CDK. And as far as I understand, it's\n[40:52] not something like if you start\n[40:53] Greenfield, you should start, oh, I'm\n[40:55] going to write a CDK and I'm going to\n[40:56] use the adapter. I'm going to be using\n[40:57] Terraform. That's not what it's for.\n[40:59] It's meant to be like we have a lot of\n[41:01] CDK stacks, we want to like quickly\n[41:03] convert them over to Terapform and this\n[41:05] can give you like a quick uh bridge\n[41:06] towards Terraform. That's how I\n[41:08] understand it. Okay. So I threw that\n[41:11] away and I started on originally not so\n[41:14] detailed. I started just I want to be\n[41:16] able to programmatically build terapform\n[41:18] configurations and the Terraform CDK\n[41:21] seemed like a good solution to me but\n[41:23] then I realized it's missing a lot of\n[41:24] stuff. So I started building high level\n[41:27] but then I keep going lower and\n[41:29] ultimately ended up reimplementing all\n[41:30] of the core features like asset pipeline\n[41:32] bundling pipeline IM pipeline like the\n[41:35] actual IM modules the the concept of the\n[41:38] you know the interfaces and the patterns\n[41:39] the way it works under the hood and\n[41:41] these these are called level two\n[41:42] constructs right\n[41:44] >> yes okay\n[41:46] >> correct uh asset pipeline is more like\n[41:48] like CLI tooling around it but it's part\n[41:50] of it's part of you could say it's part\n[41:52] of the L2 stack construct because it's\n[41:55] like a higher level. It's using the\n[41:57] low-level stack cloud for stack under\n[41:59] the hood, but it's adding a whole bunch\n[42:01] of functionality around it.\n[42:02] >> And just for my vocabulary, L1 is the\n[42:04] low level. L2 is like the asset\n[42:06] pipeline. Is it is there an L3? No.\n[42:10] So there are some L3 tries which are\n[42:12] created by professional services at AWS\n[42:14] where they have like some um more\n[42:16] advanced cloud patterns maybe for banks\n[42:18] that are building like a subscriber um\n[42:21] like producer type of pattern in the\n[42:24] cloud. So they will use several L2s and\n[42:26] combine them into a cloud pattern so\n[42:28] that it can be used by businesses that\n[42:30] would be an L3 or an L3 might be um\n[42:33] maybe\n[42:35] the real product that that I'm building\n[42:37] at my company um that is actually\n[42:39] deploying the front end deploy deploying\n[42:41] the back end.\n[42:42] >> The whole product that makes sense so\n[42:43] and then and then the other terminology\n[42:45] I'm just mapping into into these L1 L2\n[42:47] L3 is like construct and and pattern. So\n[42:50] a construct would maybe would be level\n[42:52] one and then a pattern would be level\n[42:54] two like how do you or it's not a very\n[42:57] good mapping\n[42:57] >> they they they this they this they this\n[42:58] they this they they apply the L label to\n[43:00] all constructs. So constructs are either\n[43:02] of L1 or L2 or L3. So the L1 constructs\n[43:06] are autogenerated from the b basic\n[43:10] resources that are available in cloud\n[43:11] form or if you're talking about\n[43:13] Terraform the L1 resources are the ones\n[43:15] that are the Terapform provider\n[43:16] resources directly. Okay, that makes\n[43:18] sense cuz I think I've seen I got\n[43:20] confused by that. So, and then where\n[43:22] does the the word pattern fit in here?\n[43:24] It doesn't really fit in.\n[43:26] >> Yeah, I think it's more like when they\n[43:29] talk about L3, there is like the service\n[43:32] team. I know that there is like a\n[43:34] website from AWS service team that says\n[43:36] that these are L3 patterns. These are a\n[43:40] bucket with a in with a with a lambda\n[43:42] invocation triggers for example. That's\n[43:44] a pattern that you may want which is a\n[43:46] very common pattern that you build in\n[43:47] terraform as well right um you have a\n[43:50] module that creates I have a bucket and\n[43:51] then I have a handler for a function\n[43:52] that whenever an object get pushed in\n[43:54] maybe have some type of filtering logic\n[43:56] to invoke the lambda that's like a\n[43:58] module that you would build right um and\n[44:00] in in Terraform you would build that\n[44:02] module from the low-level L1 um you know\n[44:06] lambda resource and and the bucket and\n[44:08] the service permission the IM rule\n[44:10] resource and all that in in AWS CDK you\n[44:13] will build that L3 using the L2\n[44:16] construct which is encapsulating the\n[44:17] lambda and knows how to bind itself uh\n[44:20] like it it it's backed by an I principle\n[44:23] that means that the lambda has a IM role\n[44:25] behind it right so so it it it exposes\n[44:29] itself as a as a interface so it's I am\n[44:32] a principle and a principle you can\n[44:34] grant things right so when you have a\n[44:36] lum when you have a bucket and then you\n[44:38] need to give a permission to the lambda\n[44:40] you are basically you you're using the\n[44:43] grant method method that accept an I\n[44:45] principle. It can the I principle can be\n[44:47] a lambda in this case but it can also be\n[44:49] an EC2 instance. Isn't Isn't the better\n[44:51] terminology would be to call it like a\n[44:53] service principle because it's a it's\n[44:56] it's the service is\n[44:58] >> it's I think it's closely tied to the IM\n[45:00] uh terminology which like in an IM\n[45:02] policy you have the principle the\n[45:04] resource the action\n[45:06] >> I forgot the rest so they they use the\n[45:08] the same idea the I principle the only\n[45:10] new yeah\n[45:11] >> the only new one is the grant\n[45:13] >> but but there can be different types of\n[45:15] principles right you can have a user\n[45:16] principle but you can als you can have a\n[45:18] human all of behind I principle in the I\n[45:22] module. Yeah.\n[45:24] >> Okay. Okay. Let's we're probably just\n[45:26] splitting hands at this point. Okay. So,\n[45:29] so terra constructs\n[45:31] um\n[45:33] so I still actually don't quite\n[45:35] understand. So where is it going to fit\n[45:37] in in a in a company just just where\n[45:40] where people\n[45:41] >> So the way that we use it at my\n[45:43] organization is we have two three years\n[45:45] of Terraform landing zone and so on and\n[45:48] then we had the product teams that\n[45:49] wanted to build with CDKTF uh because\n[45:52] they prefer Typescript they write uh\n[45:54] their lambdas in Typescript. they write\n[45:56] their nextgs front end, back end, BFF,\n[45:59] whatever, and they like TypeScript and\n[46:03] they want a CDKFF and I I had experience\n[46:05] with AWS CDK and I was like, yeah,\n[46:06] that's I I encourage it. I mean, um I I\n[46:10] would rather you not use AWS CDK because\n[46:12] of cloud formation than I have, like you\n[46:14] said, I have to build uh CI/CD pipeline\n[46:17] to do the plan to post the the preview\n[46:19] in my PR. I've got all of that already.\n[46:20] I've got Terraform, I've got Atlantis,\n[46:22] I've got, you know, coordination,\n[46:24] collaboration. So, we need\n[46:28] >> So, basically, how does the pipeline\n[46:30] work? The product has its repo. it\n[46:33] writes its uh their CDK and then you\n[46:37] have a you have like a GitHub action or\n[46:38] something that basically turns their CDK\n[46:42] into Terraform and runs it or do you or\n[46:44] do you like get a snapshot and then you\n[46:47] commit it to your own Terraform uh repo\n[46:49] or something?\n[46:51] >> Yeah. So I just did this presentation at\n[46:53] the um AWS community day in Koala Lumpur\n[46:56] Malaysia.\n[46:57] >> Oh yeah. How was that by the way? Was\n[46:58] that was that at the AWS offices right\n[47:02] or\n[47:03] >> Yeah, it was no it was at the university\n[47:06] uh in in Koala Lumpur. Oh\n[47:08] >> um but I do cover exactly how does the\n[47:11] workflow work between the team. So how\n[47:13] do I\n[47:14] >> Okay, we need to link this link link in\n[47:16] the description.\n[47:20] >> Yeah. So this is an example of an L2. Um\n[47:23] it's actually more like an L3 because\n[47:25] this is like a load balanced Fargate\n[47:27] service. So this uses under the hood it\n[47:30] use you see it uses something called\n[47:31] patterns. So under the hood it actually\n[47:33] set up a load balancer. It set up an ECS\n[47:35] far task definition.\n[47:37] >> So that's that's something that comes\n[47:39] out of AWS CDK right?\n[47:42] >> Yes. There's a separate library of\n[47:44] patterns and an application load\n[47:46] balanced fargate service is a\n[47:48] composition of several of the L2\n[47:50] constructs to to expose this.\n[47:53] >> Okay. Okay. So pattern does exist. Okay.\n[47:55] I wasn't going crazy. Okay.\n[47:58] I think patterns is like the service\n[48:00] team um built L trees. I think\n[48:05] >> I I think when when you talk about L\n[48:07] trees, it's like you can build L trees\n[48:09] and we build a couple of L tries and we\n[48:11] we have we expose them as a pattern\n[48:13] library. Yeah, I also forgot about that\n[48:15] it exist that that's the name of the\n[48:17] library. Yeah. So our workflow at at my\n[48:20] organization with CDKTF is that the\n[48:24] product team lives in their own\n[48:26] repository, right? And we're trying to\n[48:28] reduce the number of repositories. So if\n[48:30] a product team has front end and back\n[48:31] end uh and and an infrastructure, we're\n[48:34] trying to use more of a monor repos now\n[48:37] because we became good good at them. We\n[48:39] use like a many monor repos. So it's\n[48:42] kind of like\n[48:43] >> so the so one product one one repo,\n[48:46] right? That's what you're aiming for.\n[48:47] Okay, that make sense.\n[48:49] >> Yes. Kind of like you know the idea of\n[48:51] of is it Conway's law where you organize\n[48:54] your services based on your team or your\n[48:56] organization layout. So if you have one\n[48:58] team working on one product\n[49:00] >> so so we have the product mono\n[49:03] >> and they are defining their product in\n[49:05] Typescript lambdas whatever tightly\n[49:07] integrated with their infra resources\n[49:08] that they require for their product.\n[49:10] some of the resources like in this case\n[49:12] the the the cluster the VPC they will be\n[49:14] injected when they integrate into the\n[49:16] lending zone right but then but they\n[49:18] must be able to define those and they do\n[49:19] that in a very strongly typed language\n[49:21] TypeScript and they use SEO constructs\n[49:23] originally they use CDKTF but that means\n[49:25] they have to build their own L2s instead\n[49:27] we are building the L2s publicly make\n[49:29] them available on Apache 2 and then we\n[49:32] are using them internally within our\n[49:33] organization okay\n[49:35] >> nice nice so\n[49:36] >> so then yeah\n[49:38] >> okay So\n[49:40] I mean like I'm just thinking of um my\n[49:43] current client\n[49:45] they use CDK\n[49:48] and then they also use Terraform. So So\n[49:52] why what I mean surely didn't didn't you\n[49:55] think about uh allowing the product team\n[49:57] to run their CDK?\n[50:00] I was lucky they didn't ask they didn't\n[50:02] push for it. I did I think about it. I\n[50:06] was I was thinking actually about\n[50:08] talking pointing them towards Palumi SST\n[50:11] because that's kind of a bit of a\n[50:13] similar idea but then we would need to\n[50:15] adopt Palumi because Pulumi is\n[50:17] crosscloud but then I wasn't sure about\n[50:19] like the self-hosted Palumi story and at\n[50:21] the time I didn't know that you could\n[50:23] like self-host Palumi. I only heard that\n[50:25] it was expensive and that you had to pay\n[50:26] for the cloud and so on.\n[50:27] >> But I'm not too sure why you're talking\n[50:29] about Palumian because you can't just\n[50:31] you could have a\n[50:32] >> Yeah, I could have let them use cloud\n[50:33] formation, right? And then it could\n[50:35] publish the cloud.\n[50:36] >> You didn't even you didn't want to go\n[50:39] there or something. What were you\n[50:40] >> No, I have experience with that in the\n[50:42] past. Um we had one team heavily in\n[50:44] cloud formation and then we had the\n[50:46] whole rest of the company data team\n[50:47] everyone else using terraform and I was\n[50:50] put as part of the team that was using\n[50:52] AWS CDK and I was completely convinced\n[50:55] that AWCK was way better. I was I was\n[50:57] put in there to convert them to\n[50:59] Terraform and they converted me to you\n[51:01] know the this the the CDK story and then\n[51:04] I spent a year trying to build um\n[51:07] integration patterns between Terraform\n[51:09] and cloud formation. So you must consume\n[51:14] like integration between two different\n[51:16] products and then you must expose them.\n[51:18] So I was using SSM parameter store as an\n[51:20] integration registry which is Keith\n[51:22] Morris um you know infrastructure as\n[51:24] code.\n[51:25] >> Keith Morris is my line manager. I don't\n[51:26] know if\n[51:27] >> exactly right you told me that. So, so I\n[51:30] followed his advice uh about his\n[51:32] infrastructure as code third edition\n[51:34] whatever uh book and follow the\n[51:36] integration pattern of um integration\n[51:38] registry using SSM parameter store. Now\n[51:40] the\n[51:41] >> tell him I sent him a message on\n[51:42] LinkedIn and he never replied.\n[51:44] >> Okay, I'll I'll uh I'll let Ke know. Ke,\n[51:46] if you're watching respond. Uh okay, so\n[51:51] chapter what 17? You you're oddly\n[51:53] specific here, Vincent, but carry on.\n[51:54] Yeah, because I did a presentation about\n[51:56] it. Um,\n[51:58] I called it integrate this. I did it\n[52:01] like at the time when I had just\n[52:03] finished building the integration\n[52:04] patterns and I thought uh this is great.\n[52:07] Um,\n[52:08] >> and that's the latest book, right?\n[52:10] Because he he had a\n[52:11] >> yes I I I have already uh subscription\n[52:14] so I get access early early access and I\n[52:16] read it. Um so these are the actual\n[52:19] diagrams from his book and he's talking\n[52:21] about organizing your infrastructure and\n[52:24] then the different in integration\n[52:25] patterns. You have one provider, you\n[52:27] have one consumer and then you can do\n[52:29] resource matching which is you look up\n[52:30] the resources based on some tags or you\n[52:33] can do um stack data lookup. So if you\n[52:36] have one stack in cloud form and then it\n[52:38] has some outputs. So you need to read\n[52:40] those cloud form outputs and then um\n[52:42] integrate them within another cloud for\n[52:44] stack for example. But you know need to\n[52:45] know what the team is using. And then\n[52:47] the other one is the integration p uh\n[52:49] registry lookup pattern where everyone\n[52:52] writes to a different key convention and\n[52:55] then you can look up through the\n[52:56] integration registry. Right.\n[52:57] >> Okay. Okay. I mean this is quite common\n[52:59] actually. So Keith basically wrote it\n[53:01] up. I mean I've seen this everywhere.\n[53:03] >> SSM SSM is the registry.\n[53:06] >> Yeah. So when we adopted it we didn't\n[53:07] have strong conventions about the the\n[53:09] format of the keys. What are the like\n[53:11] the different paths that you need to\n[53:13] capture. We didn't have a clear\n[53:14] guideline of how to write your\n[53:16] dependencies out and how to read them\n[53:18] back because if you put some rules\n[53:20] around that then you can you know\n[53:23] determine that this will be like a\n[53:25] network will have a a list of certain\n[53:26] ideas and so you read it out the right\n[53:28] way the right way because now you're in\n[53:30] type languages like CDK and Terraform\n[53:33] maybe you can read it properly.\n[53:34] >> So the key go specify the actual typing.\n[53:38] >> No I don't think that's part of it. uh\n[53:41] it just mentioned that this is a pattern\n[53:42] you can follow. It's just my personal\n[53:44] experience when I I started to use it.\n[53:46] We had problems like that like teams\n[53:49] didn't have a clear way or convention on\n[53:51] how to write to it. Uh another problem\n[53:54] is that this becomes an a layer of\n[53:56] indirection and becomes stale like how\n[53:59] do you you know keep it up to date? How\n[54:01] do you know that the value has changed?\n[54:03] How do you notify also because it's a\n[54:05] layer of interaction how do you have\n[54:06] direct connectivity between provider and\n[54:08] consumer? How do you know everyone that\n[54:10] consumes that key if you don't have like\n[54:13] a an actual like point po point po point\n[54:15] po point po point po point po point po\n[54:15] point po point po point po point pointer\n[54:15] counting like if you do this in memory\n[54:16] you will you keep track of how many um\n[54:19] actual variables point to the stack\n[54:22] right so you have some counter and then\n[54:24] you can know if anyone is still reading\n[54:26] it and so none of that right and so when\n[54:28] you start it sounds very simple and I\n[54:30] was very confident I did this\n[54:32] presentation I say this solves all of\n[54:33] our problems but at that time I already\n[54:35] realized that like having some type of\n[54:37] generics around it so that we and type\n[54:39] when we read it back out is actually\n[54:41] really nice. Um, but that never really\n[54:43] happened, right? Our teams had written a\n[54:45] whole bunch of stuff into SSM parameter\n[54:46] store and then we couldn't really keep\n[54:48] track of like who was consuming it. I\n[54:51] also thought that this was great that\n[54:52] this was a a read indirection layer\n[54:54] because now it meant that I could move\n[54:56] things around and then just update the\n[54:57] registry from different places. Big\n[54:59] mistake because you have no idea where\n[55:01] it comes from. So, so this pattern um is\n[55:05] why I did not like my teams to use cloud\n[55:08] formation and then adopt some type of\n[55:10] indirection layer to communicate with\n[55:12] them, right? So, I actually tried to\n[55:14] roll this out and I had my landing zone\n[55:17] publish all of its like integration\n[55:18] points into the SSM parameter store. Uh\n[55:20] and then you get other problems like how\n[55:22] do you control the consumer permissions\n[55:24] or who can write to these keys? How do\n[55:26] you, you know, do you cross-ost like do\n[55:29] you do you have a central one or do you\n[55:31] have this one provider right to\n[55:33] different accounts where they have to\n[55:34] find it? So, there's a lot of of of\n[55:36] problems there and I decided I'm just\n[55:39] going to get rid of this whole problem\n[55:41] by just using the native built-in\n[55:43] Terapform stack feature which is, you\n[55:44] know, Terraform outputs. Right.\n[55:46] >> Right. I mean, I'm just thinking I'm\n[55:49] just mapping this to my own experience\n[55:51] about a registry. I think the one at my\n[55:54] workplace that we ended up just doing is\n[55:57] is essentially we keep a huge a like a a\n[56:02] source of truth a JSON file in GitHub\n[56:06] and we use that to sort of coordinate a\n[56:09] lot of stuff because like hey you want\n[56:11] to know where this is which account this\n[56:12] goes into what what secret you need.\n[56:16] >> It's horrible isn't it?\n[56:17] >> I I like it. I like\n[56:19] >> it's horrible. I like a single uh large\n[56:22] JSON file. I mean because you know\n[56:25] >> JSON even even worse if it was YAML\n[56:29] you wouldn't have all these like\n[56:30] trailing commas or next line changes\n[56:32] when you know these git tips would look\n[56:33] a little bit better.\n[56:34] >> In my opinion the JSON can is is just an\n[56:36] output uh here but but it's good. It's\n[56:39] it's it's a better paradigm than\n[56:42] sprinkling stuff across an SSM paths for\n[56:46] Christ's sake.\n[56:47] >> Yeah. Yeah. Agree. Um so so very common\n[56:51] like you said is the TFRs in terapform\n[56:53] world where people you know copy paste\n[56:55] TFRS files around for this environment\n[56:57] we need those TFRs from that environment\n[56:59] we need this TFRS it's a bit similar\n[57:02] >> but like but this but this is like even\n[57:04] bigger this is across environments\n[57:07] uh\n[57:08] >> with Terrant you also have the ability\n[57:10] to like define dependencies and it\n[57:12] automatically create the JSON files and\n[57:14] caches them under the hood and then it\n[57:16] keeps track of them to like more quickly\n[57:19] run like consumer provider interactions\n[57:22] and so on. But Teragrant again also very\n[57:24] quickly becomes like sprawls out of\n[57:26] control, right? So, so you're asking me\n[57:29] like why did I not just allow them to\n[57:31] write their infrastructure in AWS CDK\n[57:34] and I I'm telling you that my biggest\n[57:36] problem was the integration patterns.\n[57:38] You're saying one solution could have\n[57:40] been to create more like a central file\n[57:42] so that they would need to read from\n[57:44] there um and things like that. But when\n[57:47] you say central file, it sounds very\n[57:49] similar to SSM parameter store.\n[57:51] >> Yeah, but but SSM parameter store gets\n[57:53] out of hand because you could you could\n[57:55] use arbitrary paths. You can use\n[57:58] >> what about the JSON file? What are the\n[57:59] arbitrary like fields paths that you use\n[58:02] in JSON files?\n[58:03] >> They're just they're just keys and you\n[58:06] know,\n[58:06] >> but what's the structure of the keys and\n[58:08] are they nested keys?\n[58:09] >> Well, you have the same problem.\n[58:12] >> Well, they are they are nested. Yeah. Uh\n[58:15] >> yeah. how\n[58:17] that's where you then get similar\n[58:19] problems.\n[58:19] >> I think I think majority of them are\n[58:21] just are are just keys. They're not like\n[58:22] lists if that makes sense.\n[58:26] >> That's I think one thing I learned about\n[58:28] Terraform because a lot of people when\n[58:29] they write a module they go like well\n[58:31] this resource that I just created should\n[58:33] really be accessible and they just you\n[58:35] know output the all of the attributes of\n[58:38] the resource to the module and then you\n[58:40] know you're basically have zero\n[58:42] encapsulation. The idea of modules is a\n[58:43] bit encapsulation so that you don't\n[58:45] create these deeply nested attributes\n[58:48] dictionary key values um but you rather\n[58:51] create individual outputs like if you\n[58:53] want the gateway uh endpoint there's a\n[58:55] variable there's one key for the gateway\n[58:57] endpoint if you want the subnet ID uh\n[59:00] maybe um you know maybe that's a list\n[59:02] because subnet ID is usually like three\n[59:04] whatever but but not deeply nested\n[59:06] objects basically detailed attributes as\n[59:10] individual outputs\n[59:11] >> yeah I think That's I think we're\n[59:13] aligned there. Yeah. But like\n[59:15] >> it it works well. Um um and the the best\n[59:19] thing of all cuz I don't think SSM can\n[59:22] really do this very well except you can\n[59:24] look back in the versions. But like the\n[59:26] brilliant thing about central registry\n[59:28] is that you have the really nice change\n[59:30] log.\n[59:33] You have logs on on SSM parameter store.\n[59:36] But I think I think the idea is this.\n[59:39] either you put it in git or you have\n[59:42] something wrapping more as a service\n[59:44] around SSM parameter store but just like\n[59:46] no control over parameter store\n[59:49] >> is definitely a recipe for disaster.\n[59:51] >> Yeah. A config file in git is the sweet\n[59:56] spot for me. I know it works well.\n[59:59] >> Okay.\n[1:00:03] >> We're getting a little bit distracted. I\n[1:00:04] mean, so you you were saying you you\n[1:00:08] were pushing people you you didn't want\n[1:00:10] people to to deploy to run CDK deploy\n[1:00:13] just because of coordination issues, I\n[1:00:15] guess, is what I'm hearing.\n[1:00:18] >> Yes. Um, one of the main issues was to\n[1:00:22] avoid stale values and copy value across\n[1:00:24] the source of truth of the integration\n[1:00:27] because this again is not in a single\n[1:00:28] repo, right? It's across many\n[1:00:30] repositories and\n[1:00:34] because of that we originally had tried\n[1:00:38] to have the product monor repo run the\n[1:00:42] terraform apply and consume across um\n[1:00:45] you know SSM parameter store but that\n[1:00:47] didn't really work so instead we still\n[1:00:50] keep the dev infra directly applied from\n[1:00:53] the product manual repo. So for the dev\n[1:00:55] environment they can run terraform apply\n[1:00:57] every time they make a change without\n[1:00:58] going through any integration\n[1:01:00] repository. But when they want to go\n[1:01:02] towards\n[1:01:03] um so when they run apply here on the\n[1:01:05] dev infra folder basically the package\n[1:01:09] gets consumed in the dev infra\n[1:01:11] application uh or environment and when\n[1:01:14] the developer runs apply it creates the\n[1:01:17] environment the the the resources in\n[1:01:19] pink here purple here and then the\n[1:01:20] integration with like the dev ingress\n[1:01:22] ALB and the dev VPC and so on right so\n[1:01:25] so we are copying over the VPC ID the\n[1:01:27] ALB reference as values into the dev F\n[1:01:31] monor repo but it we're not copying\n[1:01:32] staging and prod and all the other\n[1:01:34] environments just one only dev okay\n[1:01:36] >> okay okay environment they're completely\n[1:01:39] they have full full control over the dev\n[1:01:41] environments which they should they\n[1:01:43] should be able to do what they need\n[1:01:44] right and then when it comes to actually\n[1:01:48] promoting this out of dev um they've\n[1:01:50] done their QA themselves and they want\n[1:01:53] to put this into like staging or prepro\n[1:01:56] that's where they are um versioning and\n[1:01:59] releasing\n[1:02:00] a an actual artifact. So they're\n[1:02:04] publishing their infra package which no\n[1:02:07] longer is a module. We don't need\n[1:02:09] special terapform registry or anything\n[1:02:10] like that. We can just use their\n[1:02:12] existing u pnpm workflow or npm\n[1:02:15] packaging workflow or python if they\n[1:02:17] want because cdk can be python but we\n[1:02:19] don't do that. So so so you don't need\n[1:02:21] like special artifact management for\n[1:02:22] infrastructure anymore. Infrastructure\n[1:02:24] is managed the same way as your code.\n[1:02:26] You're deploying, you're publishing and\n[1:02:28] minting, versioning, change lock,\n[1:02:29] everything. All of your tools can just\n[1:02:31] be reused and we p push it into code at\n[1:02:33] effect.\n[1:02:33] >> So, okay,\n[1:02:34] >> I'm still a little bit puzzled here. You\n[1:02:36] call it a package, but is surely it's\n[1:02:38] it's it's not a whole bunch of code.\n[1:02:40] Surely it's just some\n[1:02:42] >> Oh, it is a bunch of code. It is a bunch\n[1:02:43] of code. It is like\n[1:02:45] >> So basic so basically the code and dev\n[1:02:48] and the code and\n[1:02:50] >> it's if you are familiar with\n[1:02:51] Kubernetes, we don't use Kubernetes. So\n[1:02:53] it's like a Kubernetes Helm chart. Oh,\n[1:02:55] okay. Okay. Sorry. I I read product as\n[1:02:58] uh as production. Sorry. Sorry. I think\n[1:03:00] that's where I was confused.\n[1:03:02] >> It's good you asked this because this is\n[1:03:04] the most common question I get about\n[1:03:05] Terra constructs. Like sounds great, but\n[1:03:07] how do you actually use it? And that's\n[1:03:10] what I try to focus on on this\n[1:03:12] presentation.\n[1:03:13] >> So yeah, you're saying that this is the\n[1:03:15] most common questions uh why of the\n[1:03:18] thing.\n[1:03:19] >> Yeah. So after I talk about all of the\n[1:03:21] great things that you can, you know,\n[1:03:22] that you get because now you get these\n[1:03:24] really nice developer patterns or\n[1:03:26] service integration patterns.\n[1:03:28] >> Now, now that you mentioned Atlantis,\n[1:03:29] yeah, Atlantis is uh is great. I\n[1:03:32] actually need to work out how to\n[1:03:33] introduce that into my into my uh\n[1:03:35] company. M so I'm I'm I have a\n[1:03:39] customuilt EMI and I have custom CDKTF\n[1:03:43] workflows and I want to for Terra\n[1:03:45] constructs and I want to publish my AMI\n[1:03:49] as like the bootstrap for Terra\n[1:03:52] Construct. So if you want to start with\n[1:03:53] Terra Constructs in your organization\n[1:03:56] here is your construct to bootstrapped\n[1:03:59] Atlantis. So it deploys Atlantis with\n[1:04:02] all of the settings for running CDKTF\n[1:04:04] synthesis to Terapform running Terapform\n[1:04:06] apply integration with your pull request\n[1:04:08] and all that.\n[1:04:08] >> That's my I mean if you yeah like if if\n[1:04:13] you\n[1:04:13] >> but I don't have if your elevator pitch\n[1:04:16] is basically how to use Atlantis with\n[1:04:18] CDK I think I get it actually. My my\n[1:04:23] pitch is you want better devx for your\n[1:04:26] developers and most people are like\n[1:04:31] uh it's complicated why do I need an\n[1:04:32] additional synthesis step how do I\n[1:04:34] integrate it into my Atlantis um I can't\n[1:04:37] control my developers and my engineers\n[1:04:39] they are very creative they create\n[1:04:40] really convoluted\n[1:04:42] infrastructure if I let them write them\n[1:04:44] in typescript uh how do you control that\n[1:04:46] well that's where I think part of\n[1:04:49] product like platform team is that you\n[1:04:51] surface is the pattern so that you can\n[1:04:53] you know with bootstraps so that you can\n[1:04:56] >> so that you extract the convoluted\n[1:04:59] patterns into reusable patterns I don't\n[1:05:01] know\n[1:05:01] >> to keep the things align I mean the same\n[1:05:03] thing with modules right people are\n[1:05:04] going to write crazy modules\n[1:05:06] >> it sounds like you are doing a a great\n[1:05:09] thing in a sense like allowing the\n[1:05:10] product team to use a code that's\n[1:05:13] familiar to them but ultimately uh\n[1:05:16] keeping Terraformers\n[1:05:19] >> the first class infrastructure uh uh\n[1:05:22] DevX I think that makes a lot of sense\n[1:05:24] actually\n[1:05:25] >> I'm trying to bridge the platform team\n[1:05:27] and the product team because the\n[1:05:29] platform team lives in breeds terapform\n[1:05:31] they have three years of you know code\n[1:05:33] scanning they have their whatever maybe\n[1:05:36] they're not using Atlantis but they have\n[1:05:37] their own GitHub workflows to run and\n[1:05:39] apply um their Terraform with pull\n[1:05:42] request like PR reviews uh previews\n[1:05:45] sorry yeah\n[1:05:46] >> I I love what you just said there uh\n[1:05:48] building a bridge between platform and\n[1:05:51] and product team though like I'm just\n[1:05:53] also mapping this to my current uh gig\n[1:05:56] right now. I mean I think if I showed\n[1:05:58] them this at at my workplace they would\n[1:06:00] be terrified because we don't want\n[1:06:02] products to develop to write\n[1:06:04] infrastructure as code. We want them to\n[1:06:07] config like we want a very very tight\n[1:06:09] configuration for them like all all\n[1:06:13] >> find this funny because there's a saying\n[1:06:15] is it from\n[1:06:19] we want products to be able to do what\n[1:06:22] they need to do without being blocked by\n[1:06:24] platform right platform must provide\n[1:06:26] golden paths must provide easy adoption\n[1:06:28] for the um for the cloud but they cannot\n[1:06:32] be the bottleneck they cannot be the\n[1:06:34] ones that are preventing\n[1:06:35] the team. Um,\n[1:06:38] >> well, that's I I agree. I totally agree\n[1:06:41] with that. But like but in a in a\n[1:06:45] >> uh Yeah, but in a in a but in a big\n[1:06:47] company it it's not scalable.\n[1:06:50] I I can see it making a thousand.\n[1:06:52] >> No, that's why platform teams exist,\n[1:06:54] right? Platform teams are supposed to\n[1:06:56] provide the tools so that you can keep\n[1:06:58] it under control so that the product\n[1:07:00] teams can still evolve. So you in like\n[1:07:02] big banks you will have like a\n[1:07:03] declarative YAML config file that under\n[1:07:05] the hood sets up 10 different terraform\n[1:07:08] modules in just the right way so that\n[1:07:10] they get deploy uh what they need or\n[1:07:12] maybe use custom resources because\n[1:07:13] you're on Kubernetes or whatever right\n[1:07:18] so this is from platform con 20 uh 2024\n[1:07:20] talk from Gregor Hop and he talks like\n[1:07:23] nobody wants 80% of Dynamob like your\n[1:07:26] module is not just like exposing sane\n[1:07:28] defaults as a better Dynamob under under\n[1:07:30] the hood, they still need the features\n[1:07:33] of Dynamob and if your module doesn't\n[1:07:35] expose it, your module is not better,\n[1:07:37] right? It's just it's just restricting\n[1:07:39] access to it. But it's\n[1:07:41] >> that's a very that's very interesting.\n[1:07:44] Uh\n[1:07:46] did you ever meet Gregor? Because he\n[1:07:47] used he lived in Singapore a few fair\n[1:07:49] few years.\n[1:07:50] >> I was at a few conferences where he was\n[1:07:53] as well, but I never really interacted\n[1:07:56] much with him. Yeah, he he spoke at the\n[1:07:59] AWS meetup, too. That this is very\n[1:08:01] interesting because like I think I mean\n[1:08:04] I feel like I've been drinking through a\n[1:08:06] straw somehow because every every gig\n[1:08:08] I'm on, we make a module to give give,\n[1:08:13] you know, 80% to the developer. And now\n[1:08:18] you're sort of you're sort of flipping\n[1:08:19] the table over here by saying that no\n[1:08:22] you're uh\n[1:08:24] your platform team should be allowing\n[1:08:27] them to do\n[1:08:29] >> one of my previous CTOs at uh previous\n[1:08:32] company he was ex AWS as well I don't\n[1:08:34] think he was in a technical role there\n[1:08:36] but he um basically had a lot of\n[1:08:38] experience on how they did things at AWS\n[1:08:40] and he says the platform team's\n[1:08:42] responsibility is to put in guard rails\n[1:08:44] they're not the bottleneck they just\n[1:08:46] need to make sure that teams can do what\n[1:08:47] they need to do without shooting\n[1:08:49] themselves in the foot. So your job\n[1:08:51] really is put in place, you know, the\n[1:08:54] the scanners, the llinters and the\n[1:08:56] dashboards around it. So if we do have a\n[1:08:58] misconfiguration, we can catch it as\n[1:09:01] most of the lift as possible.\n[1:09:02] >> I mean, I'm I I'm fully behind that.\n[1:09:04] Like so basically the platform team\n[1:09:08] isn't uh producing modules, they're more\n[1:09:11] like producing confest type stuff,\n[1:09:13] right? Or linting type stuff. But like\n[1:09:16] I've just never seen\n[1:09:16] >> but at the same time like the goal of\n[1:09:19] the platform team is to observe teams\n[1:09:22] usage of the cloud and extract golden PS\n[1:09:26] so that we can keep teams aligned so\n[1:09:28] that you know teams don't do completely\n[1:09:30] different things so that if a new team\n[1:09:32] wants to start a new project they have a\n[1:09:34] tech radar and they can figure out today\n[1:09:36] the recommended way of doing that is\n[1:09:38] using this golden path and if I follow\n[1:09:41] this golden path\n[1:09:42] >> that definitely doesn't happen in my\n[1:09:44] current workplace like The idea is that\n[1:09:46] is that uh we're laying the tracks\n[1:09:49] before the product teams get there and\n[1:09:52] uh hopefully it's the tracks that they\n[1:09:54] want to take which is something that\n[1:09:57] I've always heard as a complaint around\n[1:09:59] platform teams and actually one company\n[1:10:01] I worked at was very resistant and very\n[1:10:04] against towards moving towards a\n[1:10:06] platform team they had embedded SRE\n[1:10:08] there was a huge um compliance\n[1:10:10] initiative and they completely refused\n[1:10:13] because they were like you guys are\n[1:10:14] going to be a bottleneck. You're going\n[1:10:15] to prevent us to do what we want to do.\n[1:10:17] >> And and to just to be clear, uh I as an\n[1:10:21] infrastructure engineer, I I hate\n[1:10:23] platform teams. The whole idea for me is\n[1:10:26] just terrible. I'm more in favor of a\n[1:10:28] cross functional embedded uh so uh\n[1:10:30] embedded infrastructure engineer\n[1:10:32] pattern,\n[1:10:33] >> but I always end up as the\n[1:10:35] infrastructure engineer in a platform\n[1:10:36] team essentially. Uh and the funny thing\n[1:10:40] is I've been at a lot of organization\n[1:10:41] that try to push me towards in embedded\n[1:10:43] SR role and I always end up completely\n[1:10:47] withdrawing myself from product and\n[1:10:49] focusing 100% on the cloud and the CI/CD\n[1:10:51] and how to make a solution that\n[1:10:53] stretches across all the teams and then\n[1:10:56] complaining if people are not using it.\n[1:10:57] So I I have like the the opposite like\n[1:11:00] habits of view\n[1:11:01] >> but I I try to really focus now like I\n[1:11:04] want to be part of the of the product\n[1:11:06] team. I want to be part of the road map\n[1:11:07] but it's very hard for me.\n[1:11:08] >> There's some very interesting approaches\n[1:11:11] here. I mean can you I mean I can't\n[1:11:14] claim to I can't claim the current\n[1:11:16] working uh approach in my client is is\n[1:11:21] successful. I can't claim that at all\n[1:11:23] but it's very uh conservative and very u\n[1:11:27] established way of doing things. Can you\n[1:11:29] honestly say to me, Vincent, that you've\n[1:11:32] you've worked with product teams and\n[1:11:34] you've given them a golden what did you\n[1:11:36] say? A golden\n[1:11:37] >> golden path.\n[1:11:38] >> A golden path and they loved it. I mean,\n[1:11:40] that sounds also kind of Let's be\n[1:11:42] honest.\n[1:11:43] >> I did I say that I give them a golden\n[1:11:45] path and they loved it.\n[1:11:47] >> Well, I mean,\n[1:11:48] >> I I did work at one organization.\n[1:11:50] >> That's what you're alluding to, right?\n[1:11:52] So we did I did in in that same\n[1:11:54] organization where they went full in on\n[1:11:57] AWS CDK um where the platform team had a\n[1:12:00] lot of Terraform. We had a very heavy\n[1:12:03] Kubernetes footprint and we built a\n[1:12:05] Golang CLI that bootstrapped deployments\n[1:12:07] on top of Kubernetes and\n[1:12:11] we had the funny thing is we had like 40\n[1:12:14] brands and but it was behind it was\n[1:12:16] always this two teams and so it was very\n[1:12:19] easy to roll it out across the teams and\n[1:12:22] we were able to like align all of the\n[1:12:24] teams but we did get the feedback from\n[1:12:26] the CTO like I I didn't mean to create\n[1:12:28] like an isolated team that built the\n[1:12:31] platform and then another isolated and\n[1:12:33] then the product team. We want I wanted\n[1:12:36] DevOps. I wanted you know embedded\n[1:12:37] SRRES. I wanted you guys to to build on\n[1:12:41] you know for the product and I mean\n[1:12:47] I don't know um we rolled it out we used\n[1:12:50] it. It was we used Argo CD so it was\n[1:12:53] generating all of the uh manifests for\n[1:12:56] our GitOps and it was able to centralize\n[1:13:00] the Helm charts. So we had like the\n[1:13:02] ability to roll out and ch make changes.\n[1:13:05] I think the biggest problem right when\n[1:13:07] people when teams move away from like\n[1:13:09] embedded SRS towards platform teams is\n[1:13:11] compliance. When you start doing audits\n[1:13:13] and sock 2 and all that then suddenly\n[1:13:16] now you have to integrate the zero trust\n[1:13:17] all over the company. Now you certainly\n[1:13:19] have to have the you know bill of uh\n[1:13:21] software bill of material asbomb and you\n[1:13:23] have to track and you know provide audit\n[1:13:25] reports that you are addressing uh\n[1:13:27] vulnerabilities um on on time. You have\n[1:13:30] to provide your full uh network\n[1:13:32] infrastructure and your firewall rules\n[1:13:34] as a compliance audit report quarterly.\n[1:13:37] You have to have great glassass\n[1:13:39] functionality. When all of that becomes\n[1:13:41] imperative to the product teams,\n[1:13:44] suddenly you need to have a more\n[1:13:46] centralized approach towards managing\n[1:13:48] your infrastructure. And that's where\n[1:13:50] organizations tend to then switch more\n[1:13:52] towards platform teams. That's also I\n[1:13:54] think one of Hashikcom's um\n[1:13:56] presentations from like evolution of\n[1:13:59] like maturity. So all of the\n[1:14:01] organizations start with this um\n[1:14:05] no that's not what I wanted. I just\n[1:14:06] wanted\n[1:14:07] >> center view. Who who does that?\n[1:14:10] >> Uh I'm clearly not a a dude that's used\n[1:14:14] to make presentations. Anyway, so so\n[1:14:16] stage one like singular teams, ad hoc\n[1:14:18] approach, everyone does whatever they\n[1:14:19] want. Sing to standardizing, centralized\n[1:14:21] deploys, policy enforcement, team\n[1:14:23] collaborations, and then platform team\n[1:14:24] self-service.\n[1:14:26] >> Yeah. I'm I'm usually in that stage\n[1:14:28] three uh uh what do you call it journey?\n[1:14:32] Yeah.\n[1:14:33] >> Yeah. So so and and that's also funny\n[1:14:36] because like most Most startups or\n[1:14:39] organizations don't hire DevOps until\n[1:14:41] they start hitting these centralization\n[1:14:43] problems, right? And then they're hiring\n[1:14:45] DevOps because they have reliability\n[1:14:46] issues. They have a disparity in\n[1:14:49] technology stacks across different\n[1:14:50] teams. They have no way of like rolling\n[1:14:52] out compliance. Uh but the good thing is\n[1:14:54] they have money, they have revenue and\n[1:14:56] so they can hire DevOps team which is\n[1:14:59] DevOps. the whole idea of like being\n[1:15:01] embedded in like breaking down the walls\n[1:15:04] uh being doing agile now becomes no we\n[1:15:06] actually are hiring a system\n[1:15:07] administration team to help us adopt the\n[1:15:09] cloud and tame it and\n[1:15:11] >> are you suggesting standardizing is uh\n[1:15:14] is dev is is the embedded approach\n[1:15:18] because\n[1:15:18] >> no no no no standardizing is the\n[1:15:21] platform approach.\n[1:15:24] Yeah, because I thought\n[1:15:26] >> a lot of organizations they will have um\n[1:15:28] >> so so so so stage one so stage one is\n[1:15:32] the is the uh cross functional team\n[1:15:35] approach right? Yeah. And then and then\n[1:15:38] already in stage two we have to have\n[1:15:40] >> So what do you mean with cross\n[1:15:41] functional? I think stage one is when\n[1:15:43] every team has like ah cross functional\n[1:15:45] meaning every team has a guy doing\n[1:15:46] DevOps or the CI/CD.\n[1:15:47] >> Yeah. Exactly.\n[1:15:48] >> More like embedded. Right. Yeah.\n[1:15:50] >> Yeah. It's interchangeable here to me.\n[1:15:53] So stage one is embedded because that's\n[1:15:56] because we because at my my employ my my\n[1:15:59] consultancy employer we we always\n[1:16:02] advocate uh a cross functional embedded\n[1:16:04] uh infrastructure engineer but it never\n[1:16:07] really happens for one reason or another\n[1:16:09] as I mentioned. So and that's already\n[1:16:11] stage one. I feel that's that's kind of\n[1:16:14] frightening because there's a very\n[1:16:15] interesting book that one of a candidate\n[1:16:17] I interviewed pointed me out. I think he\n[1:16:18] worked at works as well. He told me that\n[1:16:20] to read team topologies which is there's\n[1:16:23] an evolution of the teams and and how\n[1:16:26] you like there's there's an in between\n[1:16:28] there's like fully embedded everyone\n[1:16:29] does its own there's like platform at\n[1:16:32] complete opposite and then there's like\n[1:16:33] a cross like a lot of like bandwidth\n[1:16:36] between um how you may have\n[1:16:38] >> because because this diagram doesn't\n[1:16:40] seem to even it's it's either like\n[1:16:42] >> yeah no this is a sales pitch from Hashi\n[1:16:44] Corp which sells a platform solution\n[1:16:46] right\n[1:16:47] >> yeah I get it I get Uh yeah, so this was\n[1:16:50] a original slideshow that I made for\n[1:16:52] before I started Terra Constructs which\n[1:16:54] was the idea was to make something\n[1:16:55] called the environment toolkit and I\n[1:16:57] don't know why I cannot zoom in uh zoom\n[1:16:59] out anymore. Um but basically\n[1:17:03] the problem is that we have two personas\n[1:17:07] in a lot of organizations. We have\n[1:17:09] product teams, we have platform teams.\n[1:17:11] Well, there's a few others, but like uh\n[1:17:13] and the idea was like the app team, they\n[1:17:15] are the ones that need the like a very\n[1:17:19] nice interface. They should\n[1:17:20] >> if you just give them YAML without any\n[1:17:22] schema, then they may shoot them, they\n[1:17:24] may not really know how it works. Um and\n[1:17:27] and it's not a very nice experience for\n[1:17:29] them, but that's commonly what's done\n[1:17:31] today, which is like you give them a\n[1:17:32] YAML spec file that they have to fill in\n[1:17:34] and then under the hood, the platform\n[1:17:36] team builds the actual modules. like you\n[1:17:39] say they set the path they they\n[1:17:41] >> the things right um\n[1:17:44] >> why do you say why do you say it's not\n[1:17:46] very nice\n[1:17:49] >> cuz well\n[1:17:51] >> I think YL is not very nice\n[1:17:53] >> well I mean it's I mean it's a lot\n[1:17:55] easier than them bloody writing code CDK\n[1:17:58] let's be honest\n[1:18:01] >> why is the file read only this is my\n[1:18:03] file\n[1:18:04] >> and maybe maybe a separate comp\n[1:18:06] >> sorry did you say again about what's not\n[1:18:09] very nice.\n[1:18:10] >> The the YAML driven\n[1:18:13] uh product team. What's wrong with that?\n[1:18:17] >> Um the problem with YAML is that\n[1:18:22] if you miss a space, you get an error.\n[1:18:25] If you you don't know exactly where\n[1:18:28] >> use pickle, guys.\n[1:18:29] >> No, you should use a proper programming\n[1:18:31] language. Stop inventing all these\n[1:18:33] additional like Q and um what's the\n[1:18:36] other ones? JSON net and like there's a\n[1:18:38] thousands of them there's a hundreds of\n[1:18:40] them and all of them have the same\n[1:18:42] problem\n[1:18:43] >> but they become a programming language\n[1:18:45] ultimately in the end all of them become\n[1:18:46] programming languages\n[1:18:47] >> during that conf\n[1:18:50] I I I met some Apple engineers and they\n[1:18:53] were they pitched pickle and I was\n[1:18:54] convinced that pickle is the is is a\n[1:18:57] really good way of uh\n[1:18:59] >> yeah so so that that's what I'm trying\n[1:19:00] to say with this thing here um there's a\n[1:19:03] whole bunch of like you just told me the\n[1:19:06] IDE experience. Does Spickle have a nice\n[1:19:09] IDE in terms?\n[1:19:10] >> It does. Unfortunately, it seems to\n[1:19:14] >> Wrong example.\n[1:19:15] >> They they seem to favor Jet Brains, but\n[1:19:18] uh you know\n[1:19:18] >> Oh, so anyway, does Pickle have a proper\n[1:19:21] package manager and registry?\n[1:19:23] >> Yes. Yes.\n[1:19:26] >> It's so good. It's so good.\n[1:19:29] >> This is is pickle touring complete?\n[1:19:32] >> I think so. Yes.\n[1:19:35] >> Wrong. Copic language shouldn't be too\n[1:19:36] incomplete.\n[1:19:38] >> Then why are you not writing it in\n[1:19:40] Golang?\n[1:19:42] >> Uh you can't expect people to pick up\n[1:19:44] Golang.\n[1:19:45] >> Yeah. So So\n[1:19:47] >> Pickle's designed to\n[1:19:49] >> for one task in mind. Uh is explained to\n[1:19:52] me by by the um the Apple engineer. He\n[1:19:55] says like uh you know you need it's the\n[1:20:00] alarm has gone up gone off. It's 2:00\n[1:20:02] a.m. and you need to make that change\n[1:20:04] safely.\n[1:20:05] So, so essentially you're logging into\n[1:20:09] that m to that machine at 2 a.m. and\n[1:20:12] making a config change that you could\n[1:20:14] literally cannot mess up.\n[1:20:16] >> Okay. Well, I don't know why I'm getting\n[1:20:19] these results here, but it says the\n[1:20:20] learning curve is really difficult. It\n[1:20:22] has a GVM depend because I entered why\n[1:20:25] you should not use pickle.\n[1:20:27] >> That's actually a very good answer. U\n[1:20:30] yeah that that's that's very good\n[1:20:31] answer. like but yeah you're right it\n[1:20:35] does require JVM but uh you know I can\n[1:20:37] look past that\n[1:20:40] and it it does have a learning curve but\n[1:20:42] like oh my god I mean\n[1:20:44] >> it's enhance safety and maintainability\n[1:20:46] it's reduced duplication it's\n[1:20:48] abstraction of modality to me pickle\n[1:20:50] sounds like JSON net like why why should\n[1:20:52] I use pickle and not JSON net\n[1:20:55] >> JSON is horrible when I last looked at\n[1:20:57] it\n[1:20:59] >> yeah so agree like I never really got\n[1:21:02] JSON at properly. Um, so\n[1:21:05] >> also very very both like pickle's very\n[1:21:07] tight actually. It looks looks and reads\n[1:21:09] very nicely.\n[1:21:11] >> Uh,\n[1:21:12] >> I may have to play with it. But I have\n[1:21:14] my my reason to get into Terra\n[1:21:16] constructs and Typescript was\n[1:21:17] specifically because TypeScript is\n[1:21:19] everywhere. Uh, it's that's one of my my\n[1:21:22] my\n[1:21:23] tenets in life\n[1:21:24] >> but still but still\n[1:21:25] >> the last five years\n[1:21:26] >> I I I don't think I can get behind. I\n[1:21:30] mean, I can maybe you're working with\n[1:21:31] startups, but I still think\n[1:21:33] >> product teams maybe I've been working\n[1:21:35] for too many big companies and stuff.\n[1:21:38] >> Product teams shouldn't be writing uh\n[1:21:42] CDK. It's going to get crazy real quick.\n[1:21:46] >> That's always like when I talk about\n[1:21:48] this is a standard reply. Startups\n[1:21:50] shouldn't be writing CD like product\n[1:21:52] engineers shouldn't be touching infra\n[1:21:53] code and\n[1:21:55] >> I mean I mean startups and midsize\n[1:21:58] companies I think it's actually pretty\n[1:22:00] quite good but if you're like a large\n[1:22:03] heavily regulated industry that's never\n[1:22:06] going to fly\n[1:22:08] >> and I I think at that point you don't\n[1:22:11] ask the product engineer to write it but\n[1:22:13] you give the platform engineer the right\n[1:22:15] tools to build better extractions for\n[1:22:18] the pro for the product engineer. there\n[1:22:20] because again like this is what we\n[1:22:22] talked about last time as well. There's\n[1:22:23] this deck CDK\n[1:22:26] which gives you the ability to build a a\n[1:22:29] strict types like strongly typed schema\n[1:22:33] YAML um interface or front end which\n[1:22:37] Pulumi also has which is like\n[1:22:39] >> it reminds me of the the serverless\n[1:22:41] application.\n[1:22:42] >> Oh yes like SLA SAML\n[1:22:46] >> uh not SAML sorry SAM. Oh yeah.\n[1:22:49] Serverless applica. What is the end\n[1:22:51] server?\n[1:22:51] >> I've been doing too much authorization\n[1:22:52] and authentication.\n[1:22:55] >> Yeah. So, so but but this is a bit\n[1:22:58] funny, right? Because it kind of like\n[1:22:59] gives you the L2 con L2 or L3 construct\n[1:23:03] as a YAML uh composition thing.\n[1:23:05] >> Actually, I I love it. I love it. It\n[1:23:07] works for me like uh nine out of 10\n[1:23:10] times.\n[1:23:11] >> And and I think that's kind of the\n[1:23:13] experience that we can build on top of\n[1:23:15] Terra constructs or CDKF. basically a\n[1:23:17] front end question right under the hood\n[1:23:20] like docker file is a front end they\n[1:23:22] completely reworked uh docker as well\n[1:23:25] like docker file does is not the\n[1:23:27] standard like you can have different\n[1:23:28] front ends you can have a yaml front end\n[1:23:30] you can have an other front end because\n[1:23:32] now you're building actual proper\n[1:23:34] programming objects that can you know\n[1:23:37] bind themselves and evolve and can be\n[1:23:39] configured differently you're not stuck\n[1:23:41] with static terraform modules that you\n[1:23:43] then have to bunch put a whole bunch of\n[1:23:44] go templating around because you're\n[1:23:47] asking you're giving your engineers um a\n[1:23:49] YAML interface to basically configure\n[1:23:51] modules under the hood. That's what I\n[1:23:53] hear banks do, right? And and it's the\n[1:23:55] same with with Kubernetes. That's\n[1:23:56] exactly what Helm is. You're just\n[1:23:58] putting Go templating around bunch of\n[1:24:00] YAML, which is Kubernetes um resource\n[1:24:02] definitions or manifests, right? And and\n[1:24:04] and\n[1:24:06] we see where that goes. We see a Helm\n[1:24:09] chart with like a values.yamel where you\n[1:24:12] have no idea how that gets, you know,\n[1:24:13] interpolated by the gold templates under\n[1:24:15] the hood. The gold templates are\n[1:24:17] extremely complicated with like\n[1:24:19] >> well\n[1:24:19] >> too much logic within the template\n[1:24:21] engine.\n[1:24:21] >> That's why I showed you that Terraform\n[1:24:23] project that I was cooking up the other\n[1:24:25] day because because I use pickle and and\n[1:24:29] when you run it through pickle you can\n[1:24:31] see the pickle schema. You can see your\n[1:24:33] pickle. You can see how it it it becomes\n[1:24:36] Terraform JSON. But why do I have to\n[1:24:38] learn a new language when Typescript is\n[1:24:40] already a TypeScript compiler that gives\n[1:24:42] me strong typing and capabilities like\n[1:24:44] Pickle except I don't have to learn\n[1:24:46] Pickle and I can just run TypeScript.\n[1:24:48] >> Well, the thing that I like about it is\n[1:24:51] that it's clear to me\n[1:24:53] what\n[1:24:55] what is the entry point into Terraform\n[1:24:58] when I'm writing in Pickle. It's it's\n[1:24:59] very it's clear as day. But if you're\n[1:25:01] writing CDK\n[1:25:04] uh and using Terra constructs, then then\n[1:25:07] you you really don't know what the\n[1:25:10] Terraform resources are going to look\n[1:25:11] like until the\n[1:25:13] >> No, that's not the same thing as what\n[1:25:15] you just started the sentence with. You\n[1:25:16] said you you you know the entry point\n[1:25:19] and then you say you don't know what's\n[1:25:20] going to look like. That is a very\n[1:25:22] different\n[1:25:24] I know the entry point when I use CDK. I\n[1:25:27] know exactly how this is going to get\n[1:25:29] invoked uh because I have a strongly\n[1:25:31] typed interface now that is defined\n[1:25:32] under TypeScript and TypeScript compiles\n[1:25:34] to JSON schema. So I can expose that\n[1:25:36] typed interface as a with a JSON schema\n[1:25:39] on top of a YAML file and then my\n[1:25:41] engineers can write YAML uh except they\n[1:25:43] get an error message if they don't put\n[1:25:44] the field in the right place or if they\n[1:25:46] have a typo or if they put misplace a a\n[1:25:48] space. Maybe you get the same with\n[1:25:50] pickle because you get a strongly typed\n[1:25:52] pickle file or pickle config. But you\n[1:25:54] get exactly the same with TypeScript.\n[1:25:55] You can expose it as a JSON schema and\n[1:25:57] you can allow people to provide config\n[1:25:59] files and you can control the entry\n[1:26:01] points.\n[1:26:02] >> Okay. Okay. I I might have misspoke here\n[1:26:04] but what I'm trying to say is that the\n[1:26:06] the translation is is more is more uh\n[1:26:10] straightforward in my mind because\n[1:26:13] >> but then you're not dealing with\n[1:26:14] complicated terapform configurations.\n[1:26:16] You're probably I I need to know exactly\n[1:26:18] what is a terapform configuration.\n[1:26:19] >> Yeah. I mean, am I rec\n[1:26:23] I'm just I'm just mapping it into a\n[1:26:25] module and you're right when you when\n[1:26:27] you in your example when you're messing\n[1:26:29] around with API gateway or or lambda\n[1:26:32] >> which is a realistic cloud because you\n[1:26:34] just cloud workloads because what you\n[1:26:36] just said this is what we all use and\n[1:26:38] terapform modules are horrible at it and\n[1:26:39] then you're going to have to write\n[1:26:40] pickle to wrap the horrible terapform\n[1:26:43] experience which is very limited because\n[1:26:45] it only has like 40 different variable\n[1:26:47] inputs the outputs are not even typed\n[1:26:49] you write pickle again to do that. But\n[1:26:51] how about we go back to the source? How\n[1:26:53] about we build a proper L2 construct and\n[1:26:55] then we they know how to bind each\n[1:26:57] other. And this example here, these 230\n[1:27:00] lines of Terraform is not to tell you\n[1:27:02] like this is what you're going to work\n[1:27:03] with. This is to show you the complexity\n[1:27:04] and the ugliness of what's under the\n[1:27:06] hood.\n[1:27:07] >> This is what you write.\n[1:27:09] >> Yeah.\n[1:27:09] >> And this is a well-known pattern because\n[1:27:11] this is actually the AWS CDK pattern.\n[1:27:12] This is literally the CDK workshop\n[1:27:15] example except it's on my landing page\n[1:27:17] and now it spits out terraform.\n[1:27:20] I I think it I think it it definitely\n[1:27:22] makes sense to empower product teams,\n[1:27:26] but I I I keep on going back to the to\n[1:27:28] the thought that in a in a heavy\n[1:27:31] regulated company, you you would have to\n[1:27:33] just give them a very locked down uh\n[1:27:37] >> Yeah. And that's where a platform team\n[1:27:39] would need to build using these\n[1:27:41] constructs instead of these modules\n[1:27:43] actually with a proper programming\n[1:27:44] language.\n[1:27:45] >> Um they would be able to build what they\n[1:27:46] need.\n[1:27:47] >> Okay. So the platform team uses terror\n[1:27:49] constructs to create the golden paths\n[1:27:53] >> for example. Yes. Um like the pattern\n[1:27:56] here that I showed on the other slide uh\n[1:28:00] which was\n[1:28:02] I'm allowing my teams to deploy onto\n[1:28:04] Fargate and we use an application load\n[1:28:06] balancer. In our case the application\n[1:28:08] load balancer is part of the landing\n[1:28:09] zone. So they must import it using from\n[1:28:12] application load balancer attributes.\n[1:28:13] Maybe I can wrap all of that up in as my\n[1:28:16] sample app. um you know Typescript\n[1:28:18] interface. So you must provide the\n[1:28:20] necessary attributes to import the load\n[1:28:22] balancer, the VPC and the cluster. And\n[1:28:25] this is a strongly typed interface of\n[1:28:26] what are my my integration points?\n[1:28:30] >> Okay. And then how complete is Terra\n[1:28:32] Constructs? Do you do you support like\n[1:28:34] everything CDK throws at it or is it\n[1:28:36] like some\n[1:28:37] >> No, no, no. So, so I started with like\n[1:28:40] every single AWS module that is in AWS\n[1:28:43] CDK and more moving it over into on top\n[1:28:45] of Terraform and that's been very\n[1:28:47] manual. Then I also used LLMs to\n[1:28:49] automate that process. But I still need\n[1:28:51] to write all of the unit tests. I need\n[1:28:53] to write all of the integration tests. I\n[1:28:54] need to validate everything.\n[1:28:55] >> So just you're just getting started sort\n[1:28:57] of thing. I mean\n[1:28:59] >> like a year getting started. Um, so at\n[1:29:02] this point I I I'm focused on building\n[1:29:06] the the features that I need at my\n[1:29:08] organization, right? Um, what what I\n[1:29:11] want\n[1:29:13] >> that's a great slide deck actually. I\n[1:29:15] really like that.\n[1:29:16] >> Yeah. What what I want\n[1:29:20] at this point if people are interested\n[1:29:21] they should reach out and they say like\n[1:29:23] great we use Fargate a lot. I don't see\n[1:29:25] Fargate right now. Like this pattern\n[1:29:27] that I show here it's a little asterisk\n[1:29:30] at the bottom there. pending the ECS\n[1:29:32] pattern module public release. So this\n[1:29:34] is not in Terra construct integrated\n[1:29:36] yet. I need to make that public.\n[1:29:37] >> Just just very quickly why why Fargate\n[1:29:39] instead of uh serverless? It just there\n[1:29:42] needed to be persistent.\n[1:29:43] >> We use a lot of serverless at at my\n[1:29:45] organization and um at some point\n[1:29:49] there's longunning job like services\n[1:29:50] that you need to run and better to run\n[1:29:53] them in containers\n[1:29:54] >> without the whole Kubernetes\n[1:29:57] >> um complexity. So we use Terraform a\n[1:30:00] lot.\n[1:30:01] >> I'm with you. I'm with you. Kubernetes\n[1:30:03] is such a nightmare.\n[1:30:05] >> So it's very funny because when we met,\n[1:30:07] I was running the Docker and Kubernetes\n[1:30:09] meetups and you would tell me like why\n[1:30:10] don't you just use Compose? It's so much\n[1:30:12] simpler. And I would be like Compose\n[1:30:14] doesn't have all the dials and knobs\n[1:30:15] that you need and Kubernetes is like\n[1:30:16] properly designed and easy.\n[1:30:19] >> This this must have been years ago.\n[1:30:21] >> Yeah. 2017 maybe. Yeah. Well, oh, well,\n[1:30:26] that's back when uh what was that? Core\n[1:30:30] OS. I love core OS. Don't know what\n[1:30:32] happened to it.\n[1:30:33] >> They were acquired by IBM. Now there's a\n[1:30:38] flat car Linux. It was fully integrated.\n[1:30:41] No, they were acquired by Redhead and\n[1:30:42] Redhead was acquired by IBM, right?\n[1:30:45] >> Yeah.\n[1:30:46] >> Yeah. So, so Coras was acquired by\n[1:30:47] Redhead. All of the core OS projects\n[1:30:49] such as tectonic were integrated within\n[1:30:52] open shift and then they replaced like\n[1:30:55] the CentOS or whatever the Redhead\n[1:30:58] container Linux became was rebranded\n[1:31:00] Coros really really so all of the\n[1:31:02] Cororez like um systemd integrations\n[1:31:06] which ultimately systemd is a redhead\n[1:31:07] project as well right um core was 100%\n[1:31:10] built on top of systemd\n[1:31:12] >> so the so so then some of the original\n[1:31:14] cororos people that were not part of the\n[1:31:15] acquisition or some people involved with\n[1:31:17] the project created flat car Linux. I\n[1:31:19] don't know where that went, but um today\n[1:31:21] um Talos is super interesting because\n[1:31:24] they're they're taking this whole like\n[1:31:27] exposing the the the Linux\n[1:31:28] administration\n[1:31:30] surface completely through the API,\n[1:31:32] which was another OS also had this idea.\n[1:31:34] I don't know if it was Talos, but there\n[1:31:36] was another one doing the same thing.\n[1:31:38] >> Not sure what what Talos is. Sounds like\n[1:31:40] a security product.\n[1:31:42] >> Uh Talos. Talos. Talos.\n[1:31:45] But anyway, just to to defend my Oh, you\n[1:31:48] know what it is. Yeah, and I think I\n[1:31:49] know what it is. Yeah.\n[1:31:50] >> Yeah, they just have a new landing zone\n[1:31:52] uh landing page. Sorry.\n[1:31:55] >> They expose\n[1:31:56] >> But going going back to my going back I\n[1:31:58] I don't remember talking to you about\n[1:32:00] Docker Compose, but I think actually\n[1:32:02] Docker Compose is one of those\n[1:32:03] technologies that I I still regularly\n[1:32:06] use and love.\n[1:32:07] >> Oh yes, absolutely. It's just when when\n[1:32:09] Docker tried to take it and replace it\n[1:32:11] with Swarm, right? They they like,\n[1:32:13] >> \"Oh that was a show.\"\n[1:32:15] >> No, nobody liked Swarm. Um, so so yeah,\n[1:32:20] doctor time with it.\n[1:32:22] >> Okay.\n[1:32:23] >> Okay. I think we need to somehow end\n[1:32:25] this uh because I'm uh but I\n[1:32:28] >> getting tired running out of time.\n[1:32:30] >> I did really really enjoy this. I think\n[1:32:32] we covered a lot of things. I think\n[1:32:34] maybe I'm in the right. Okay, one more\n[1:32:36] thing.",

It's a bit of a\nslow burn. I hope you enjoy it. like the\nvideo. Um, and I recommend listening\nthis to this in in a car. You don't need\nto look at the screen. I I did capture\nan angle of me from the side, which I\nthink is a bit unflattering. Uh, so you\ndon't need to watch this. We we do try\nshare the the screen and browse to the\nthings that we talk about, but\nessentially I feel this is a podcast\nformat. You don't need to watch the\nvideo, but the video helps. Do please\nenjoy and comment below.\n>> See you.\n>> Why did I rebuild it? I probably didn't\neven need to rebuild it. Okay, so the\nvalue on top of Terapform. Um last time\nwe talked about a lot of drama around\nthe cloud providers and the way that you\nmanage Terraform state and the resource\nunder um under management pricing that's\nexuberant and then some drama around\nsome open source projects and I'm very\nexcited about them because I have my own\nopen source project which is focused on\nstrongly typed terraform right um\noriginally terraform\n>> I mean just to interrupt you I mean like\nterraform is pretty typed I mean you\nhave your strings, you have your default\nvalues, you have your\n>> strings,\n>> strings for enum values.\n>> Uh, okay. You have strings, strings,\nstrings. No, you have um I'm sure you\nhave integers. I'm I'm sure.\n>> No, no, but the problem is\n>> you have reg x you have uh you have\nstuff, right?\n>> Yeah. So, Terraform basically\nis built on the concept of plugins or\nproviders for a for clouds and cloud or\nfor pro for SAS or whatever services\ncloud services that give you an API\nwhere you can create resources such as\nAWS creates gives you an EC2 API where\nyou can create an EC2 uh resource,\nright? And that was very good and well\num you know 10 years ago where you just\nneeded to create a VPC couple of subnets\nan instance or an autoscaling group and\nthe number of knobs and dials that you\ncould configure were not that much but\nthen you start to having like life cycle\nhoots on autoscaling groups that works\nwith lambdas and you have SNS topics and\nyou have a lot of different services and\ndifferent integration patterns between\nthem right the cloud became way more\ncomplex uh a lot more serverless is now\nbeing part of a lot of the tech stack\nAnd Terraform is originally just a\nconfig file and a lot of programmatic\nfeatures were completely omitted. So\nthey tried to keep it dumb. They tried\nto keep it as simple as possible to\navoid people shooting themselves in the\nfoot. Most of the time when you talk to\npeople about using actual programming\nactual programming language for for um\ncloud configuration, they say like that\nis a mistake. Like um what are you doing\nthat requires a programming language?\nyou should stick to the the proven path\n>> like a more declarative style of uh\n>> yeah declarative way of of doing things.\nBut then they introduce for each. Then\nthey introduce list comprehensions. Then\nthey introduce local blocks. And then\nyou look at the Terraform AWS community\nmodule that has like 45 different\nvariables for input and and like five of\nthem need to be set in a specific way to\nthat trickles down through different\nlocal blocks with different tertiary\nconditionals that then need to value\nlike that go down ultimately in one\nresource configuration and then you\ndon't even know how those variables\ninteract. Speaking speaking of\ncomplexity, I mean I always thought\nserverless was a godsend because it's\ngoing to uh simplify\nuh deployment of um of uh of application\ncode, simplify the you know the life\ncycle, simplify\nuh everything to do with with that sort\nof stuff. For some reason um in\nTerraform at least provisioning a lambda\nis just a nightmarish uh I wonder why\nlike why is that? How come Terraform\nnever managed to make lambda versioning\nsimple\n>> because Terraform's\nprovider is built on the bare minimum\nresources to cover the API. So you go\ninto very granular level to you know to\nto set up a lambda you must configure\nthe lambda permission resource you must\nconfigure the IM role you must couple it\nand bind it to the lambda\n>> so there was no good uh there was no\ngood abstraction or something um\n>> so the the abstraction in terraform is a\nterapform module which is very limited\nin the way that you can configure it. It\nprovides a fat set of variable inputs\nand it provides some outputs and there's\nno guarantee around the type system of\nthe output at all. Like the outputs are\nany they can be maps, they can be lists,\nthey can be strings, they change if you\ndepending on the internal of the module.\nIf you decide to put a count inside the\nresource and then you use those outputs\nuh or those attributes in an output,\nthen suddenly those outputs become a\nlist and you know for some reason\nbecause under the hood something\nchanged, right? Yeah, that's inherent to\nhow terrible modules are developed.\n>> Actually, I mean my usage of of of\nserverless is generally quite\n>> what what do you call it? uh\nstandardized\n>> you know I usually just run a go binary\nbut I guess that's the trouble with\nserverless is that you can do you can\nyou can do a lot with serverless you can\nintegrate it in lots of different ways\nright\n>> well so the great thing about serverless\nis that you you're able to configure\nvery expressive business logic across\ncloud resources but that's also\nimmediately why it becomes so complex\nright because now your business logic is\nspread across your serverless components\nand if you work with something like\nTerraform, those components are very\nlow-level resources that all need to be\nconfigured exactly right for your actual\nbusiness logic to work.\n>> I mean I mean\n>> think about like a simple lambda\nchaining setup where you have lambda.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. I I want to definitely get away\nfrom that because my my usage of of of\nserverless and is to is to essentially\nrun my monolithic application.\nLike for me serverless is like a way\nbetter uh ECS\nBut of course that doesn't work. I guess\nthat is the crux of the problem with\nwith lambda because yeah you can get\nchaining, you can get uh distributed\nsystems, you can get microservices,\nyou can get all sorts of things with\nlambda and then of course the complexity\nexplodes.\n>> That's right. And the complexity\nexplodes not only just because of how\nyour business logic gets like trickled\ndown across all of your cloud resources\num but also because of how these cloud\nresources are spread across different\nservices of the cloud provider. For\nexample in AWS you have a cloudatch\nservice you have a uh where you define\nyour logging groups and then your\npermissions of your lambda must be\nconfigured to write to those logging\ngroups. So that's an integration between\ntwo different services. you have your S3\nbucket where you have to have your\nlambda notification like settings done\nor you use event bridge where you have\nto have like event bridge rules that\nthen need to be capturing the right\nevent fields that you want to propagate\ntowards the lambdas. So the main problem\nis the integration across the different\nservices and you know how to bind them\ntogether and that's where AWS does like\nsolves it really well\n>> but lambda and cloudatch should be a uh\nwhat do you call it a fixed pattern or\nsomething like that\n>> it changes a lot and and and it's funny\nbecause sometimes\nit could be very simple like you have a\nsituation where you want a lambda to be\ntriggered on an event bridge rule and\nyou can simply go to the lambda and say\nasync config and then say on success and\nthen it will you know trigger another\nlambda or something else right and if\nyou do a very simple like lambda\nchaining and you can do that directly on\nthe lambda resource it works until you\nhave a use case and that's a very fixed\npattern but then you have a use case\nwhere now when the lambda success\nhappens you want to extract some field\nfrom the um success event like you need\nto get the actual um I don't know result\nfield from the ext JSON of that success\nevent and you want to get the extract\nthe payload like extract a certain\npayload then suddenly you can't do that\nwith async evoke that's not possible\nwith the way that the the lambda API\nworks and you must use event bridge\nrules so you're very use like very\nsimple pattern of like integrating two\nthings together which should always be\nthe same thing no longer works because\nnow you have an event bridge rules that\nlike match messes up your whole like\nsituation because you need to parse the\npayload of the event and get out one\nfield. And that's an example that I\nlearned because I wrote a library to to\nimplement um these integration patterns\nfrom AWS CDK on top of Terraform. And so\nI saw that like this is very this is an\nintegration test actually that they have\non their Lambda function integration. Um\n>> okay. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So\n>> I can show you the the actual running\ncode for that.\n>> Okay. So so you're just showing some\nLambda REST API. That's actually quite\ninteresting because uh we we we use that\na lot at work.\n>> Yeah. So so that's where the reality of\nthe cloud today is that people are using\nthese type of patterns more and more and\nand that's also because you want to you\nknow leverage the cloud to accelerate\nyour business feature delivery. So you\ncan't be like completely decoupled from\nthe cloud. You start to be really\ningrained and integrated with the cloud\nfeatures. Even though a lot of original\ncloud adoption was like we want to be\ncloud agnostic, Kubernetes is great. The\nreality is even if you use Kubernetes,\nyou're going to have a whole bunch of\ncustom resources just for AWS um to use\nto to to integrate with the cloud that\nyou run. at at work we we love to use\nthe lambda rest API because because it\nintegrates with IM and then IM is the\nway that we uh uh mediate govern uh\ndifferent APIs between different uh\nteams and stuff and a lot of the things\nin AWS is like the benefits is that\ntight integration between services right\nbecause like you just said IM is is a is\na really nice way to control permissions\nacross all of across all of for\nresources. Um, and so yeah, but I I\npulled this up because this is kind of a\nnice example and this is a great example\nfrom originally when they released the\nAWS CDK workshop um in how it simplifies\nlike try to imagine how you would do\nthis with terapform modules. You're\ncreating a function,\n>> right? And and you're specifying here is\nsomething very special already which is\nthe from asset. So this is actually\ngoing to\n>> this is a whole asset pipeline built in\nright in there. It's going to take care\nof bundling the code, you know, putting\nit in S3, making sure that the lambda\ncan pick it up or you can, you know,\ndirectly put the code in line. That's\nsomething that you cannot imagine how to\nbuild this with Terraform modules,\nright? I mean, I know that there's an\nattempt serverless.tf\nto do this, but I mean, it's just it's\njust a mistake and I'm sorry because I\nknow the people behind this uh and I try\nto to to explain that, but yeah, they\nhave, you know, this their projects at\nPET. So uh so anyway yeah so this whole\nthis one line already is an asset\npipeline and then this one right here\nthe lambda rest API is a special rest\nAPI so this is object-oriented\nprogramming and it's it's like an\nextension it's just not a rest API it's\na lambda rest API that understands the\nconcept of a handler that is backed by a\nfunction so this handler must implement\nthe function interface and then it knows\nhow to bind and automatically create the\nthe API gateway integration and back end\nlender call right\n>> yeah So, so, so just these lines\nalready. Um,\n>> and you get all the LSP, you know, what\ndo you call it? Checking to make sure\nthat everything's there.\n>> So, because this is an actual\nprogramming language with enums and and\nTypeScript is specifically built to add\ntyping on top of a non-type language\nlike JavaScript. So, it has a lot of\nfunctionality to to inspect the type\nschema and to to really be strong around\nyour typing. So you do get like indeed\nlike the from asset then it will the\nhandler with the I function and it's\nstrongly typed right.\n>> Okay. So I I'm I think I know where\nyou're going with this. So you're not\ntalking just about primitive typing.\nYou're talking about like fun function\ntyping and such and so forth. I'm not\nsure if that's the right terminology.\n>> I'm also not sure about the terminology.\nBut what I'm trying to say is that if\nyou have the telephone provider you're\ngoing to have a string. You say it's\nvery strongly typed, but yeah,\n>> string has only like three possible\nvalues. And when I'm building my\nlibrary, I'm actually have to go to the\nEC2 or the Alumba um you know API docs\nto figure out what are the valid values\nbecause that's nowhere in Terraform,\n>> right? And and they they they can't\nreally because they they need to cover\nso many AWS services. It's manually\nwritten as well. And I'm still relying\non the Terapform provider AWS except I'm\nbuilding the CDK library on top of it.\nSo, so this is the example from AWS CDK,\nbut now it's running on top of\nterraform, right? So, I have the same\nthings. I have the code, the lambda\nfunction, the lambda rest API. Um, for\nsome reason, I didn't call it function.\nI called it lambda function. And that's\nbecause I put everything under under one\nname space. I put it all under AWS\ncompute, which maybe was a mistake, but\nokay. Uh, and then I have the AWS asset\nlike the stack, the AWS stack, which is\na um extension of the classic Terraform\nstack. This is a stack that understands\nabout AWS asset pipelines. So it knows\nabout ECR. It knows about S3. So it\nknows that if you use and that's\nnecessary because when you use AWS CDK\nit's built on top of AWS. It's built on\ntop of cloud form. So it has the ID of\nasset pipeline and things like that. So\nif I want to do this code from asset\nhere, I actually am building if I\nsynthesize this\n>> I I actually have the S3 bucket. If I\ndon't pass in the bucket to the the\nstack, it will create a bucket for me\nand it will automatically upload my uh\nlambda source code bundled up and put it\nstraight into my S3 bucket. Now some\npeople when you are doing terraform\nthey'd be like no your your code\ndelivery must be decoupled right on one\nside terraform stand up the the skeleton\nand on the other side you have your\nactual code that needs to be built and\nand deployed. But when you're in the\nserverless world the resources and your\nactual business logic are very tightly\ncoupled. That's so true. That's so true.\nSo I think the next question in my brain\nwas that okay you create a bucket for\nthe for the sourcing your your\napplication code but like what happens\nwhen you destroy that with the bucket go\n>> uh or yes or do\n>> so this is your terraform under the hood\nright um there is yeah the the terraform\ncall because the bucket is the object is\nalso managed by terraform so terapform\nwill first delete the object then if the\nbuck then it will delete the bucket AWS\nwill prevent that\n>> if there's still some some objects\ninside then it will not allow it.\n>> Okay. So, so you're saying that\nTerraform will completely handle all the\nobjects inside there I suppose.\n>> Yeah. So, so this is purely translating\nthe AWS CDK on a deep deep level\ndirectly to Terraform resources and not\njust any resources but the actual\nTerraform provider AWS resources. That\nmeans that all of your existing like\nterraform linting um you know code code\nscanning everything still works. Cool.\nAnd then and then another question\nbecause uh C CDK I believe has this\nbootstrap uh functionality where it does\ncreate its own bucket for the stack up\n>> right.\n>> Yeah. So I don't I don't do that. Um no\nmy AWS stack has like a it's called like\na singleton pattern. It will create an\nS3 bucket if it's necessary. You can\npass it in directly to the AWS stack as\nu stack as well. So when you invoke this\nlike my CDK workshops tag when I call\nthe constructor if I in the constructor\nproperties pass in my own bucket then it\nwill take that one right\n>> this is again\n>> the power of actual you know I mean a\nlot of people hate on object-oriented\nprogramming but the ability to define\nlike to use the basic object of a\nterapform stack and then extend it with\nfunctionality just reuse the constructor\nand have this capabilities built in\nmakes it so much nicer like you can't\nreally do that with terapform modules or\nlike bundling terapform models on top of\neach other. Right.\n>> Right. Right. But like Okay. So if you\nhad the option to use the CDK bootstrap,\nyou didn't that's obviously just not a\ndefault here like by default.\n>> Yeah. No, the CDK bootstrap does a lot.\nAnd the actual asset pipeline from AWS\nCDK is built into the CDK CLI. So it's\nnot a cloud for thing. The AWS CDK CLI\nhas the idea of uh bundling code and um\nputting it into a staging directory and\nthen preparing a manifest of what is\ninside the staging directory that needs\nto go into S3, what needs to go into\nECR. So that's what the CLI does.\nTerraform kind of like worked around\nthat by providing special provider\nfunctions. So it doesn't like Terraform\ndoesn't understand or doesn't care about\nAWS asset pipeline, right? But you do\nhave the ability to create like use a\nterapform provider to create an S3\nbucket and upload an S3 object. So I'm\nkind of offloading that asset pipeline\nto native Terapform provider\ncapabilities which I'm not sure if it's\nthe best way but it does allow me to\nlike hand off the life cycle completely\nto Terraform\n>> the way that it does.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n>> Those are all conscious decisions as\nwell.\n>> There's a there's a lot of details in\nhere too. So so say a company's using\nCDK. Um,\n>> but let's be honest, I think we talked\nabout this before. CDK got there um is\ngreat, but it it's only 80% of the way\nthere. Like it and and correct me if I'm\nwrong, like this the support from CDK on\nthe AWS side seems a bit weak right at\nthe moment or do you think they'll come\nback into it or like what?\n>> So that's interesting to hear. Um\n>> I'm trying to I'm trying to like map the\nfuture of CDK\n>> for me is a pivotal tool for or\ndeveloper tooling for AWS to hear that\nthey I know that they've withdrawn some\nof the stuff um but they are still\nactively developing it like they they\nadded the C the CDK refactoring for\nrefactoring stacks across was integrated\ndirectly I mean the cloud formation\nrefactoring feature was was integrated\ncompletely into the CDK. You can\nrefactor stacks now through the CDK CLI.\nThey added an API or like a programmatic\nway to call the AWS CDK as well. So they\nare developing and adding more features.\n>> Okay. So what does what is sorry what\ndoes refactoring actually mean in in the\nin CDK?\n>> Yeah. So in the in the world of\nTerraform or in the world of\ninfrastructure as code, the moment you\nthat you start treating your AWS\nresources as code, um you must be able\nto do things that are you know very\ncommon with code. And I can give you an\nexample for you may start with one\nproject and you create a network and you\ncreate a database and you create a\ncluster or you create something like\nthat and then you deploy your web\napplication. You're running a whole\nKubernetes cluster for your blog, right?\nI'm just kidding. H but then you decide\nthat you know you need to start a second\nproject and you don't want project two\nto completely depend on all the all of\nthe resources that belong to project\none, right? because one day maybe you\nwant to deprecate project one and you\nwant to um you know get rid of it and\nthen project two depends on half of the\nresources. So at that point you must\nmove those shared resources maybe to a\nshared layer or a shared ownership. So\nmaybe there becomes a platform team to\nmaintain the the network and the\nkubernetes cluster and then you have the\ndifferent product teams that deploy on\ntop of it and integrate within it. So\nyou asked me what re what refactoring\nwas, right? And I just said that I think\nrefactoring is a very central part of\ninfrastructure.\n>> Okay, I I got that. So okay, I for some\nreason I had I think you we were talking\nabout it a couple of weeks ago that like\nyou know the CDK the original AWS CDK\nteam um I can't remember the the name of\nthe guy who who Israel. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. He went on to to do wing lang but\nthat didn't that didn't fly\n>> reasons about it. A lot of the comments\nI saw was it's too early. Um people are\nnot ready for this.\n>> I I never really got into it. Um um\nthough, yeah. So in my mind, I thought\nto myself, okay, so CDK doesn't have its\nuh you know, BNFL.\nIs that the right word? I don't know. It\ndoesn't have its uh have a direction\nnow. Uh so um and\n>> I know that a lot of the original core\nmembers have moved on but there's still\na very large community and I think most\nof the projects I know that AWS uses it\nheavily internally like half the time\nwhen I look at like progen or\nbootstrapping or for example the PDK um\nkit\n>> okay so they're using it um\n>> when I look at the features and the\nissues the GitHub issues I see people I\nwork at this service team at AWS and we\nhave this problem and this is how this\nwould help.\n>> AWS project to make it. What is that?\n>> Oh, this is an a really cool um\nwhat I like about this is that it\nincludes like highle graph generation\nand which is another thing that I I\nbelieve is something that Terraform is\nhorrible at and also because of the way\nthat Terraform modules work.\n>> You can generate diagrams from CDK.\n>> Yeah. So there is a project called CDK\nDIA and and the thing is because you\nknow how these objects these constructs\nthey they they contain like a lot of\nhighle uh like intent and and meaning\nright so they actually capture what they\nrepresent. So you can pres represent\nthose in into logos nicely in here.\n>> Wow I can decorate your constructs.\n>> I need this at work. Wow. uh but but\n>> so there's an I inspectable interface\nthat you need you can implement to to\nbasically say how you want your\nconstruct to be shown on the diagram\nwhich you can't even imagine to do\nsomething like that with terraform\n>> this is fascinating so so so basically\nthis PDK is is some\n>> not just that it it has thread like\nplug-in thread composer it's integrated\nwith cloudscape react ts website so you\ncan you know build a their design system\nsetup up cloud cloudfront um you know do\nyour CDN um\n>> what the hell does cloudscape react\nsupposed to mean\n>> it's a system design um sorry not system\ndesign it's a design system from AWS\nthat's how they build their dashboards\nand their components\n>> oh interesting\n>> as far as I understood cloudscape\n>> okay so okay so CDK still has a lot of\nbuying because I mean sorry like\n>> I'm telling you it's a whole world and\nand\n>> because I I I mean yeah to be honest at\nwork clients are for example this client\nI'm working with\n>> has been using CDK and to be honest\n>> it's been fine I mean I I can get behind\nit there's some quality of things that I\nhate about CDK like it doesn't seem to\nbe able to plan\n>> so that's why Terra constructs would be\ngreat\n>> yeah uh so um but besides that um one of\nthe one of the technologies that they\nbought bought into is a is a database\nand the the only official uh\n>> provider is\n>> provider is terraform. So they're\nbasically\n>> those are all cloud form limitations.\n>> So basically they're stuck because they\nhave to they have to start using\nterraform. So at the moment their\npipeline like looks like you know CDK\ndeploy and then do your Terraform um\napplying cool beans but but of course\nthe question in my mind is like okay we\ncan't just keep on using CDK and keep uh\nand then and then use Terraform as a\nbaseline. We have to think about like\n>> aligning things.\n>> Yeah, aligning things. So, so I and\nyeah, we talked about it before, I'm\nsure, but like I think Terraform is the\nthe de facto winner of the day when it\ncomes to IA probably for the next god\nknows how many years\n>> mainly due to adoption.\n>> Yeah. Um\n>> yeah so\n>> I say that and yeah so so where does CDK\nfit in with this the fact that Terraform\nis is definitely not going away\n>> and it's got that sort of mind share uh\nyou know\n>> so at some organizations I worked\n>> the expectation was that the team\ndecides what they want to use if they\nwant to use CDK they can the platform\nteam had three years of platform team\nstuff so we were bootstrapping VPCs EKS\nclusters everything with with Terraform\nAnd so we just had to provide\nintegration points that is kind of\npainful for um because you now have to\ndeal with like different execution\nengines you know cloud formation and so\non. It can work if the team takes full\nownership of their CDK stack. Um but the\nmoment yeah I've also had experiences\nwhere a team has full ownership on their\nstack and then half the team leaves and\none guy is left to maintain it and he\nwas supposed to like work on really cool\ndata engineering stuff and now he has to\nmaintain an airflow cluster and he hates\nit. This sounds very accurate like too\nmany details like where does that come\nfrom?\n>> Yeah. Uh I know what you mean with\nairflow. I mean the whole MWA airflow\n3.0 I don't know if you know about that.\nThat's amaz\n>> I haven't used it for the last five\nyears.\n>> Okay. Well, there's there's basically no\nupgrade path between two and three,\nwhich makes life fun and interesting.\nUh,\n>> LLM upgrade path.\n>> Yeah. So, LLM upgrade. Um,\nyeah. Okay. So, I guess I guess what\nyou're saying is that CDK and Terraform\ncan live side by side. Then sorry where\ndoes Ter I thought when when you\nintroduced to me terror constructs to me\nI actually thought in the back of my\nmind since because of that problem that\nwe have at work we have CDK we have\nTerraform I thought you were like almost\ngifting me the the perfect solution to\nmy problem uh to align everything to\nTerraform\n>> right so what terror constructs does at\nthis point um it's my effort to\ntranslate the AWS CDK developer\nexperience on top of the core terraform\nresources and provider model. Right? So\nthere are some projects um Hashi Cororp\ncreated Terraform CDK to build the\nfoundation to automatically create\nTypeScript classes that wrap the\noriginal Terraform provider. So you can\nconfigure your Terapform resources using\nTypeScript or Golang or Python, right?\nBut Hashior never built the actual\nsystem like service integration\npatterns. it never built the IM um the\nidea of of you know connecting IM. For\nexample, in this case when I when I bind\nthe lambda the handler on top of the\nREST API, it automatically creates the\nservice role and gives the Lambda\nservice principle the ability to assume\nthat role like under the hood and it\nalso\n>> creates\n>> uh hold on. It also creates the Lambda\npermission for the gateway. Yeah,\n>> for the actual execute API gateway to\ncall that lambda and so on. So all of\nthat is is is built on top of the\nservice integration pattern between\nlambda lambda API gateway and IM. So so\nthat those are patterns that exist in\nAWS CDK.\n>> So Terraform CDK never did\n>> did that. But how but that that that to\nme you're saying that you can't imple\nyou can't deploy a lambda with terraform\nCDK then it's going to work\n>> you you just have to write your your\nvery very nice and and small um Hashi\nCororp language config file now you have\nto write a complex TypeScript program to\ngenerate that config file which of\ncourse a lot of people will say that why\nwould I use Terapform CDK. The idea is\nthat now that you have that TypeScript\nobject, you can build your own\nabstractions and you can build your own\nhigher level constructs around it. But\nthere's no interest for Hashi Corp to\nbuild that, right? They're not af Okay.\nSo, so they just got you bootstrapped\nbootstrapped.\n>> Yes, they got you bootstrapped.\n>> So, surely the whole community must have\ncropped up.\n>> This there's a few like\nattempts. So one of them is uh CDKTF\nplus which was from the original people\nbehind CDKTF. So they tried to build\nlike a level two um library of of or\nlayer 2 construct library which is like\n3 years ago but this is pretty much\narchived now. Um and they also built\nsomething else which is called the AWS\nCDK adapter where they automatically\nthey basically let AWS CDK do its job to\ngenerate cloud for resources and then\nmap those cloudformation resources on\ntop of terraform provider resources.\nUnfortunately that doesn't capture half\nof the of the functionality that is\nhidden between these objects interacting\nwith each other. like the way that you\ngenerate resources on for cloud form is\ndifferent from the way that you generate\nthem for um for terform providers and\nthey try to use a common generated\nautogenerated provider through the AWS\ncloud control API. So the cloud control\nAPI is an attempt to make available the\nthe engine behind cloud form. So you can\nactually autogenerate the terform\nprovider from the cloud controller API\nbut it's like it's gong ga I think this\nyear uh or maybe was it last year I'm\nlosing track of the years been working\non this for a year.\n>> Oh what do you mean gongji? What did\nthat word made?\n>> So it was under beta for like two or\nthree years and then it went generally\navailable. So the project to the AWSCC\nprovider\n>> because yeah because yeah like now that\nyou mention it cloud form to terraform\nmakes sense here because ultimately CDK\nis producing cloudformation.\n>> Yes. So they have an adapter but again\nit doesn't capture some of these\npatterns. So if you align the providers\nthen you should get the same\nfunctionality but there's still a whole\nbunch of like resources and patterns\nthat are not supported by this Terraform\nprovider. this autogenerated provider\nand to use it like nobody's really using\nit because when you look at these\nresources you basically get like no the\ngood thing about Terraform is that when\nyou talk to an API object you can expand\na JSON schema into like very strongly\ntype like an expanded um schema in\nterapform language right but in this\ncase the schema is not expanded like\nlet's go to the documentation and look\nat some of these resources maybe take um\nlet's look at the AP API gateway\n>> uh or maybe something simpler SNS or\nsomething I don't\n>> no no let's look at the API gateway\nbecause that is a real resour\n>> we talking\n>> so here we we we have the um you have\nthe open API spec that you pass in\n>> and then you have the deployment the\nstage but what's missing is the\nintegration right like if you hit here\nit's just doing a response\num but it's like it's an X X Amazon.\nAnyway, this is this is not strongly\ntyped. This is just JSON. You end up\njust shoving JSON all over the place.\n>> Yeah. So, so this is the Wait a minute.\nI\n>> understand it though.\n>> This project takes cloudformation and\ngenerates it those resources. Is that's\nwhat you're saying, right?\n>> No, this is the cloud control generated\nTerraform provider. So, there's two\nproviders for AWS. One is manually\nwritten and maintained by people. Every\ntime AWS releases a new feature, adds a\nnew field, adds a new whatever to any\nservice, somebody gets, you know, a pull\nrequest or somebody issue is created and\nthen it's added in\n>> um manually and manually mapped. So a\nlot of like decisions have been made to\ndo things a certain way which is like\ncompletely different from the way cloud\nform does it right.\n>> Interesting. Okay.\n>> Yeah. So the terraform provide AWS is\nwritten by humans. That also means it's\nkind of like a created experience\nbecause it kind of tries to make sense\nof where it expands things uh or how\ndoes it expose certain configuration\nfields. For example, the way that you\ndefine um I think it's like on the again\nbecause I did the API gateway conversion\nrecently there was uh the way that you\ndefine the method responses on on an API\ngateway. The way that the the actual API\nendpoint works is with like a JSON patch\nlike you have one endpoint and you have\nto like JSON patch in the differences\nand in the provider they made a\ndifferent resource for each one of them\nand when under the hood the provider\nwill build the JSON patch and send it to\nthat one endpoint to achieve what you're\ntrying to do. So this is the type of\nstuff that they can do because of the\nAPI endpoints that API gateway exposes\nis very complex for a human to you know\nbuild a JSON patch. uh and then cloud\nfor does a similar thing. It kind of\nlike like abstracts away this complexity\nof that the way that API is built and\nallows you to define it um in in one\nresource. But in terapform provider AWS,\nthey made like many different resources\nand the Golang code takes care of it\nlike building a nice little patch under\nthe hood. So the way that you write your\nconfig is really nice. Um so that's the\nadvantage of a manual written uh\nprovider right compared to like an AWSCC\nautogenerated provider. Um, but that\nalso means that most of the tooling like\nuh code scanning and everything is\naround this provider because everyone is\nthe one using it. Like all of the\nTerraform linting, all of the Terraform\nsecurity scanning, all of the Terapform\ncost calculation tooling is around this\nprovider because everyone's using this\nprovider.\n>> Yeah, I mean that's top provider by like\na way a long way I'm sure.\n>> Yes. I'm not sure about like I know some\npeople sometimes say like I we're using\nAWS CCC because the feature has never\nhas not been built on top of the\nmanually maintained one and the CC one\nhas a chance to adopt features faster\nbecause it's autogenerated.\n>> And do you know how AWSCC works? I mean\nthey they must have a pipeline that\nkicks off with uh\n>> yeah they have a they have a lightweight\nprox API to discover, provision and\nmanage cloud resources. So they they\nautogenerate it. Um I guess it\n>> the source of truth for um AWS if I\nremember is like like a Mason schema or\nsomething like that that describes the\nAPIs.\n>> Yeah, there's that's part of the of the\nPDK here as well. They they have the\ntype save API. Smitty smithy\n>> Smitty.\n>> Why did I say Mason?\n>> Smith because Mason Smith's same thing.\n>> Ah,\nit must be Yes, it must be. Yes, you're\nan LLM after all.\n>> Cuz like 10 years ago, I was working on\nuh in a video startup in Singapore. I'm\nsure I don't know if you remember.\nThat's probably when we met. And\ninterestingly,\num the the service hadn't launched and\nand AWS gave us like this JSON file that\nwas generated with Mason if I remember\ncorrectly. I don't know why Mason, it's\nprobably the wrong word, but they gave\nus a JSON file and then we just copied\nit under the AWS CLI directory and then\nall of a sudden we had all these\ncommands available to us, which I\nthought was really cool.\n>> Oh, I haven't heard about that. That's\nsounds really cool. Um, but yeah, as far\nas I know, Smithy is the the language\nthey use for API specifications or\ndefinition.\n>> Yeah. So, so that's a cool thing about\nthe like the AWS de project development\nkit again because they have this like\nREST API generation from Smithy. Um, and\nthis is how you build your your product.\nUm, so it's kind of like uh build on top\nof the AWS CDK to do that. But yeah, the\nwhole thing I was saying is that you\nhave different providers. Uh, one of\nthem is very popular but manually\nmaintained. The other one is\nautogenerated but doesn't have the full\ncoverage. And I hear from people that\nthere's still quite a few errors or\nproblems that they're facing. But but\nthat almost doesn't that almost doesn't\nmake sense. Surely something that's\nautogenerated has full coverage.\n>> No, it didn't have full No, because the\ncloud control API doesn't have full\ncoverage.\n>> The thing that backs this Yes, it's the\ncontrol. If you go to the website for\nthe AWS control uh cloud control API, it\nwill tell you how much of their actual\nservices they do cover on this.\n>> But that but that's I mean didn't Jeff\nBezel\n>> because every team developed it's like a\ntwo-piece pizza team in AWS, right? They\nbuild their own services. Nobody did a\ncentralized cloud control API, so they\nstarted building a centralized cloud\ncontrol API.\n>> To me, it kind of makes sense.\n>> Well, wait a minute. Like the the folk\nlaw goes that Jeff Bezos mandated that\nevery service team uh publishes their\nAPI. It sounds like they don't if if if\nthey can't if it can't be syndicated by\nthe cloud control API.\n>> Let's look at a year old LLM summary.\nUh\nah see see for example the the\ncertificate uh doesn't support update.\nMaybe that's simply because you can't do\nthat. But here's a little table for you\nof the coverage. Maybe this is also\nmaybe this relates directly to the\ncoverage. Looks like it has quite a lot.\nBut where are the services not covered\nthough? This is anything that is\ncovered. Um I'm wondering if cl if local\nstack is using this because they have a\nvery similar table. So local stack might\nbe using this to to generate their um\ntheir local stack.\n>> So just to reiterate what I think you're\nsaying to me, you're saying that the\nTerraform uh AWS provider has more\ncoverage than something that was\nautogenerated.\n>> When they G8, the AWSCC, they put out a\nnumber on the number of resources\ncovered. and it looked like it was the\nsame number, but when you looked into\nit, it was actually a bunch of like a\nsplit between some of the resources. Or\nmaybe I'm getting this wrong because the\nTerraform provider AWS has special\nresources that don't really have a\nbacking API. Um, but I I need to look\ninto it. They do have like that's\ndefinitely something maybe we can add in\nlater as a clarification on how much is\nthe coverage actually of the FCC\nprovider. But there is a difference.\n>> How did we even get here? Oh my god. We\ntalked about ter we talked about ter\nconstructs. We talked about why\n>> we started with spec kit. We started we\nstarted with spec kit and how it like\nformalizes or gives you workflow to do\nyour LLM work like um development. We\ntalked about some evolution in the cloud\ncode budget thing. We talked about you\nthen asked me more about um like more\nabout to towards Terraform and why I\nbuilt something like Terra constructs. I\nthink so. I gave some examples about the\nevolution of the cloud, the fact that it\nchanged and became so complex and that\nthe integration patterns between the\nservices are complex and therefore a\nsimple config file or terform module\ndoesn't do it anymore. So that's where\num I also give you examples of why the\nAWS CDK is so great. We talked a little\nbit about like it not really being\nmaintained but there's still being a lot\nof new features being added. But but\nwith Terra Constructs, I thought I I saw\nit as a way as as as migrating it. Now\nthat I'm speaking with you at length, it\nsounds like you are not thinking like\nthat. You're thinking that you're going\nto still leverage CDK, but your output\nis going to be Terraform.\n>> No. So, so there isn't an a project from\nHashi Cororp that puts uh a host service\na host um pro object around AWS CDK and\nthen encapsulates the process like when\nAWS CDK generates something it then\ngenerates the Terraform. I'm not doing\nthat. That's the adapter project and I\ndon't believe it can achieve the actual\nfunctionality required. Okay. And we\ntalked and that's why we ended up\ntalking about AWS CC because it uses\nthat AWS CC provider that not so many\npeople use that you know doesn't have\nall of this ecosystem tooling around it\nand and that doesn't like allow you I I\nbelieve like I talked to some people\nbehind the project and they told me that\nit's really just for early stage\ncompanies like quickly want to you know\nprototype how moving towards Terapform\nwould help them maybe get them halfway\nthere like you know have existing AWS\nCDK programs and put like a crud cr\ngrudge around it. So, so you understand\nwhat I'm saying? It's called the AWS\nadapter and um but it's not like a\nlong-term solution for um\nfor your\nYeah, it's called the AWS adapter for\nCDK. And as far as I understand, it's\nnot something like if you start\nGreenfield, you should start, oh, I'm\ngoing to write a CDK and I'm going to\nuse the adapter. I'm going to be using\nTerraform. That's not what it's for.\nIt's meant to be like we have a lot of\nCDK stacks, we want to like quickly\nconvert them over to Terapform and this\ncan give you like a quick uh bridge\ntowards Terraform. That's how I\nunderstand it. Okay. So I threw that\naway and I started on originally not so\ndetailed. I started just I want to be\nable to programmatically build terapform\nconfigurations and the Terraform CDK\nseemed like a good solution to me but\nthen I realized it's missing a lot of\nstuff. So I started building high level\nbut then I keep going lower and\nultimately ended up reimplementing all\nof the core features like asset pipeline\nbundling pipeline IM pipeline like the\nactual IM modules the the concept of the\nyou know the interfaces and the patterns\nthe way it works under the hood and\nthese these are called level two\nconstructs right\n>> yes okay\n>> correct uh asset pipeline is more like\nlike CLI tooling around it but it's part\nof it's part of you could say it's part\nof the L2 stack construct because it's\nlike a higher level. It's using the\nlow-level stack cloud for stack under\nthe hood, but it's adding a whole bunch\nof functionality around it.\n>> And just for my vocabulary, L1 is the\nlow level. L2 is like the asset\npipeline. Is it is there an L3? No.\nSo there are some L3 tries which are\ncreated by professional services at AWS\nwhere they have like some um more\nadvanced cloud patterns maybe for banks\nthat are building like a subscriber um\nlike producer type of pattern in the\ncloud. So they will use several L2s and\ncombine them into a cloud pattern so\nthat it can be used by businesses that\nwould be an L3 or an L3 might be um\nmaybe\nthe real product that that I'm building\nat my company um that is actually\ndeploying the front end deploy deploying\nthe back end.\n>> The whole product that makes sense so\nand then and then the other terminology\nI'm just mapping into into these L1 L2\nL3 is like construct and and pattern. So\na construct would maybe would be level\none and then a pattern would be level\ntwo like how do you or it's not a very\ngood mapping\n>> they they they this they this they this\nthey this they they apply the L label to\nall constructs. So constructs are either\nof L1 or L2 or L3. So the L1 constructs\nare autogenerated from the b basic\nresources that are available in cloud\nform or if you're talking about\nTerraform the L1 resources are the ones\nthat are the Terapform provider\nresources directly. Okay, that makes\nsense cuz I think I've seen I got\nconfused by that. So, and then where\ndoes the the word pattern fit in here?\nIt doesn't really fit in.\n>> Yeah, I think it's more like when they\ntalk about L3, there is like the service\nteam. I know that there is like a\nwebsite from AWS service team that says\nthat these are L3 patterns. These are a\nbucket with a in with a with a lambda\ninvocation triggers for example. That's\na pattern that you may want which is a\nvery common pattern that you build in\nterraform as well right um you have a\nmodule that creates I have a bucket and\nthen I have a handler for a function\nthat whenever an object get pushed in\nmaybe have some type of filtering logic\nto invoke the lambda that's like a\nmodule that you would build right um and\nin in Terraform you would build that\nmodule from the low-level L1 um you know\nlambda resource and and the bucket and\nthe service permission the IM rule\nresource and all that in in AWS CDK you\nwill build that L3 using the L2\nconstruct which is encapsulating the\nlambda and knows how to bind itself uh\nlike it it it's backed by an I principle\nthat means that the lambda has a IM role\nbehind it right so so it it it exposes\nitself as a as a interface so it's I am\na principle and a principle you can\ngrant things right so when you have a\nlum when you have a bucket and then you\nneed to give a permission to the lambda\nyou are basically you you're using the\ngrant method method that accept an I\nprinciple. It can the I principle can be\na lambda in this case but it can also be\nan EC2 instance. Isn't Isn't the better\nterminology would be to call it like a\nservice principle because it's a it's\nit's the service is\n>> it's I think it's closely tied to the IM\nuh terminology which like in an IM\npolicy you have the principle the\nresource the action\n>> I forgot the rest so they they use the\nthe same idea the I principle the only\nnew yeah\n>> the only new one is the grant\n>> but but there can be different types of\nprinciples right you can have a user\nprinciple but you can als you can have a\nhuman all of behind I principle in the I\nmodule. Yeah.\n>> Okay. Okay. Let's we're probably just\nsplitting hands at this point. Okay. So,\nso terra constructs\num\nso I still actually don't quite\nunderstand. So where is it going to fit\nin in a in a company just just where\nwhere people\n>> So the way that we use it at my\norganization is we have two three years\nof Terraform landing zone and so on and\nthen we had the product teams that\nwanted to build with CDKTF uh because\nthey prefer Typescript they write uh\ntheir lambdas in Typescript. they write\ntheir nextgs front end, back end, BFF,\nwhatever, and they like TypeScript and\nthey want a CDKFF and I I had experience\nwith AWS CDK and I was like, yeah,\nthat's I I encourage it. I mean, um I I\nwould rather you not use AWS CDK because\nof cloud formation than I have, like you\nsaid, I have to build uh CI/CD pipeline\nto do the plan to post the the preview\nin my PR. I've got all of that already.\nI've got Terraform, I've got Atlantis,\nI've got, you know, coordination,\ncollaboration. So, we need\n>> So, basically, how does the pipeline\nwork? The product has its repo. it\nwrites its uh their CDK and then you\nhave a you have like a GitHub action or\nsomething that basically turns their CDK\ninto Terraform and runs it or do you or\ndo you like get a snapshot and then you\ncommit it to your own Terraform uh repo\nor something?\n>> Yeah. So I just did this presentation at\nthe um AWS community day in Koala Lumpur\nMalaysia.\n>> Oh yeah. How was that by the way? Was\nthat was that at the AWS offices right\nor\n>> Yeah, it was no it was at the university\nuh in in Koala Lumpur. Oh\n>> um but I do cover exactly how does the\nworkflow work between the team. So how\ndo I\n>> Okay, we need to link this link link in\nthe description.\n>> Yeah. So this is an example of an L2. Um\nit's actually more like an L3 because\nthis is like a load balanced Fargate\nservice. So this uses under the hood it\nuse you see it uses something called\npatterns. So under the hood it actually\nset up a load balancer. It set up an ECS\nfar task definition.\n>> So that's that's something that comes\nout of AWS CDK right?\n>> Yes. There's a separate library of\npatterns and an application load\nbalanced fargate service is a\ncomposition of several of the L2\nconstructs to to expose this.\n>> Okay. Okay. So pattern does exist. Okay.\nI wasn't going crazy. Okay.\nI think patterns is like the service\nteam um built L trees. I think\n>> I I think when when you talk about L\ntrees, it's like you can build L trees\nand we build a couple of L tries and we\nwe have we expose them as a pattern\nlibrary. Yeah, I also forgot about that\nit exist that that's the name of the\nlibrary. Yeah. So our workflow at at my\norganization with CDKTF is that the\nproduct team lives in their own\nrepository, right? And we're trying to\nreduce the number of repositories. So if\na product team has front end and back\nend uh and and an infrastructure, we're\ntrying to use more of a monor repos now\nbecause we became good good at them. We\nuse like a many monor repos. So it's\nkind of like\n>> so the so one product one one repo,\nright? That's what you're aiming for.\nOkay, that make sense.\n>> Yes. Kind of like you know the idea of\nof is it Conway's law where you organize\nyour services based on your team or your\norganization layout. So if you have one\nteam working on one product\n>> so so we have the product mono\n>> and they are defining their product in\nTypescript lambdas whatever tightly\nintegrated with their infra resources\nthat they require for their product.\nsome of the resources like in this case\nthe the the cluster the VPC they will be\ninjected when they integrate into the\nlending zone right but then but they\nmust be able to define those and they do\nthat in a very strongly typed language\nTypeScript and they use SEO constructs\noriginally they use CDKTF but that means\nthey have to build their own L2s instead\nwe are building the L2s publicly make\nthem available on Apache 2 and then we\nare using them internally within our\norganization okay\n>> nice nice so\n>> so then yeah\n>> okay So\nI mean like I'm just thinking of um my\ncurrent client\nthey use CDK\nand then they also use Terraform. So So\nwhy what I mean surely didn't didn't you\nthink about uh allowing the product team\nto run their CDK?\nI was lucky they didn't ask they didn't\npush for it. I did I think about it. I\nwas I was thinking actually about\ntalking pointing them towards Palumi SST\nbecause that's kind of a bit of a\nsimilar idea but then we would need to\nadopt Palumi because Pulumi is\ncrosscloud but then I wasn't sure about\nlike the self-hosted Palumi story and at\nthe time I didn't know that you could\nlike self-host Palumi. I only heard that\nit was expensive and that you had to pay\nfor the cloud and so on.\n>> But I'm not too sure why you're talking\nabout Palumian because you can't just\nyou could have a\n>> Yeah, I could have let them use cloud\nformation, right? And then it could\npublish the cloud.\n>> You didn't even you didn't want to go\nthere or something. What were you\n>> No, I have experience with that in the\npast. Um we had one team heavily in\ncloud formation and then we had the\nwhole rest of the company data team\neveryone else using terraform and I was\nput as part of the team that was using\nAWS CDK and I was completely convinced\nthat AWCK was way better. I was I was\nput in there to convert them to\nTerraform and they converted me to you\nknow the this the the CDK story and then\nI spent a year trying to build um\nintegration patterns between Terraform\nand cloud formation. So you must consume\nlike integration between two different\nproducts and then you must expose them.\nSo I was using SSM parameter store as an\nintegration registry which is Keith\nMorris um you know infrastructure as\ncode.\n>> Keith Morris is my line manager. I don't\nknow if\n>> exactly right you told me that. So, so I\nfollowed his advice uh about his\ninfrastructure as code third edition\nwhatever uh book and follow the\nintegration pattern of um integration\nregistry using SSM parameter store. Now\nthe\n>> tell him I sent him a message on\nLinkedIn and he never replied.\n>> Okay, I'll I'll uh I'll let Ke know. Ke,\nif you're watching respond. Uh okay, so\nchapter what 17? You you're oddly\nspecific here, Vincent, but carry on.\nYeah, because I did a presentation about\nit. Um,\nI called it integrate this. I did it\nlike at the time when I had just\nfinished building the integration\npatterns and I thought uh this is great.\nUm,\n>> and that's the latest book, right?\nBecause he he had a\n>> yes I I I have already uh subscription\nso I get access early early access and I\nread it. Um so these are the actual\ndiagrams from his book and he's talking\nabout organizing your infrastructure and\nthen the different in integration\npatterns. You have one provider, you\nhave one consumer and then you can do\nresource matching which is you look up\nthe resources based on some tags or you\ncan do um stack data lookup. So if you\nhave one stack in cloud form and then it\nhas some outputs. So you need to read\nthose cloud form outputs and then um\nintegrate them within another cloud for\nstack for example. But you know need to\nknow what the team is using. And then\nthe other one is the integration p uh\nregistry lookup pattern where everyone\nwrites to a different key convention and\nthen you can look up through the\nintegration registry. Right.\n>> Okay. Okay. I mean this is quite common\nactually. So Keith basically wrote it\nup. I mean I've seen this everywhere.\n>> SSM SSM is the registry.\n>> Yeah. So when we adopted it we didn't\nhave strong conventions about the the\nformat of the keys. What are the like\nthe different paths that you need to\ncapture. We didn't have a clear\nguideline of how to write your\ndependencies out and how to read them\nback because if you put some rules\naround that then you can you know\ndetermine that this will be like a\nnetwork will have a a list of certain\nideas and so you read it out the right\nway the right way because now you're in\ntype languages like CDK and Terraform\nmaybe you can read it properly.\n>> So the key go specify the actual typing.\n>> No I don't think that's part of it. uh\nit just mentioned that this is a pattern\nyou can follow. It's just my personal\nexperience when I I started to use it.\nWe had problems like that like teams\ndidn't have a clear way or convention on\nhow to write to it. Uh another problem\nis that this becomes an a layer of\nindirection and becomes stale like how\ndo you you know keep it up to date? How\ndo you know that the value has changed?\nHow do you notify also because it's a\nlayer of interaction how do you have\ndirect connectivity between provider and\nconsumer? How do you know everyone that\nconsumes that key if you don't have like\na an actual like point po point po point\npo point po point po point po point po\npoint po point po point po point pointer\ncounting like if you do this in memory\nyou will you keep track of how many um\nactual variables point to the stack\nright so you have some counter and then\nyou can know if anyone is still reading\nit and so none of that right and so when\nyou start it sounds very simple and I\nwas very confident I did this\npresentation I say this solves all of\nour problems but at that time I already\nrealized that like having some type of\ngenerics around it so that we and type\nwhen we read it back out is actually\nreally nice. Um, but that never really\nhappened, right? Our teams had written a\nwhole bunch of stuff into SSM parameter\nstore and then we couldn't really keep\ntrack of like who was consuming it. I\nalso thought that this was great that\nthis was a a read indirection layer\nbecause now it meant that I could move\nthings around and then just update the\nregistry from different places. Big\nmistake because you have no idea where\nit comes from. So, so this pattern um is\nwhy I did not like my teams to use cloud\nformation and then adopt some type of\nindirection layer to communicate with\nthem, right? So, I actually tried to\nroll this out and I had my landing zone\npublish all of its like integration\npoints into the SSM parameter store. Uh\nand then you get other problems like how\ndo you control the consumer permissions\nor who can write to these keys? How do\nyou, you know, do you cross-ost like do\nyou do you have a central one or do you\nhave this one provider right to\ndifferent accounts where they have to\nfind it? So, there's a lot of of of\nproblems there and I decided I'm just\ngoing to get rid of this whole problem\nby just using the native built-in\nTerapform stack feature which is, you\nknow, Terraform outputs. Right.\n>> Right. I mean, I'm just thinking I'm\njust mapping this to my own experience\nabout a registry. I think the one at my\nworkplace that we ended up just doing is\nis essentially we keep a huge a like a a\nsource of truth a JSON file in GitHub\nand we use that to sort of coordinate a\nlot of stuff because like hey you want\nto know where this is which account this\ngoes into what what secret you need.\n>> It's horrible isn't it?\n>> I I like it. I like\n>> it's horrible. I like a single uh large\nJSON file. I mean because you know\n>> JSON even even worse if it was YAML\nyou wouldn't have all these like\ntrailing commas or next line changes\nwhen you know these git tips would look\na little bit better.\n>> In my opinion the JSON can is is just an\noutput uh here but but it's good. It's\nit's it's a better paradigm than\nsprinkling stuff across an SSM paths for\nChrist's sake.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Agree. Um so so very common\nlike you said is the TFRs in terapform\nworld where people you know copy paste\nTFRS files around for this environment\nwe need those TFRs from that environment\nwe need this TFRS it's a bit similar\n>> but like but this but this is like even\nbigger this is across environments\nuh\n>> with Terrant you also have the ability\nto like define dependencies and it\nautomatically create the JSON files and\ncaches them under the hood and then it\nkeeps track of them to like more quickly\nrun like consumer provider interactions\nand so on. But Teragrant again also very\nquickly becomes like sprawls out of\ncontrol, right? So, so you're asking me\nlike why did I not just allow them to\nwrite their infrastructure in AWS CDK\nand I I'm telling you that my biggest\nproblem was the integration patterns.\nYou're saying one solution could have\nbeen to create more like a central file\nso that they would need to read from\nthere um and things like that. But when\nyou say central file, it sounds very\nsimilar to SSM parameter store.\n>> Yeah, but but SSM parameter store gets\nout of hand because you could you could\nuse arbitrary paths. You can use\n>> what about the JSON file? What are the\narbitrary like fields paths that you use\nin JSON files?\n>> They're just they're just keys and you\nknow,\n>> but what's the structure of the keys and\nare they nested keys?\n>> Well, you have the same problem.\n>> Well, they are they are nested. Yeah. Uh\n>> yeah. how\nthat's where you then get similar\nproblems.\n>> I think I think majority of them are\njust are are just keys. They're not like\nlists if that makes sense.\n>> That's I think one thing I learned about\nTerraform because a lot of people when\nthey write a module they go like well\nthis resource that I just created should\nreally be accessible and they just you\nknow output the all of the attributes of\nthe resource to the module and then you\nknow you're basically have zero\nencapsulation. The idea of modules is a\nbit encapsulation so that you don't\ncreate these deeply nested attributes\ndictionary key values um but you rather\ncreate individual outputs like if you\nwant the gateway uh endpoint there's a\nvariable there's one key for the gateway\nendpoint if you want the subnet ID uh\nmaybe um you know maybe that's a list\nbecause subnet ID is usually like three\nwhatever but but not deeply nested\nobjects basically detailed attributes as\nindividual outputs\n>> yeah I think That's I think we're\naligned there. Yeah. But like\n>> it it works well. Um um and the the best\nthing of all cuz I don't think SSM can\nreally do this very well except you can\nlook back in the versions. But like the\nbrilliant thing about central registry\nis that you have the really nice change\nlog.\nYou have logs on on SSM parameter store.\nBut I think I think the idea is this.\neither you put it in git or you have\nsomething wrapping more as a service\naround SSM parameter store but just like\nno control over parameter store\n>> is definitely a recipe for disaster.\n>> Yeah. A config file in git is the sweet\nspot for me. I know it works well.\n>> Okay.\n>> We're getting a little bit distracted. I\nmean, so you you were saying you you\nwere pushing people you you didn't want\npeople to to deploy to run CDK deploy\njust because of coordination issues, I\nguess, is what I'm hearing.\n>> Yes. Um, one of the main issues was to\navoid stale values and copy value across\nthe source of truth of the integration\nbecause this again is not in a single\nrepo, right? It's across many\nrepositories and\nbecause of that we originally had tried\nto have the product monor repo run the\nterraform apply and consume across um\nyou know SSM parameter store but that\ndidn't really work so instead we still\nkeep the dev infra directly applied from\nthe product manual repo. So for the dev\nenvironment they can run terraform apply\nevery time they make a change without\ngoing through any integration\nrepository. But when they want to go\ntowards\num so when they run apply here on the\ndev infra folder basically the package\ngets consumed in the dev infra\napplication uh or environment and when\nthe developer runs apply it creates the\nenvironment the the the resources in\npink here purple here and then the\nintegration with like the dev ingress\nALB and the dev VPC and so on right so\nso we are copying over the VPC ID the\nALB reference as values into the dev F\nmonor repo but it we're not copying\nstaging and prod and all the other\nenvironments just one only dev okay\n>> okay okay environment they're completely\nthey have full full control over the dev\nenvironments which they should they\nshould be able to do what they need\nright and then when it comes to actually\npromoting this out of dev um they've\ndone their QA themselves and they want\nto put this into like staging or prepro\nthat's where they are um versioning and\nreleasing\na an actual artifact. So they're\npublishing their infra package which no\nlonger is a module. We don't need\nspecial terapform registry or anything\nlike that. We can just use their\nexisting u pnpm workflow or npm\npackaging workflow or python if they\nwant because cdk can be python but we\ndon't do that. So so so you don't need\nlike special artifact management for\ninfrastructure anymore. Infrastructure\nis managed the same way as your code.\nYou're deploying, you're publishing and\nminting, versioning, change lock,\neverything. All of your tools can just\nbe reused and we p push it into code at\neffect.\n>> So, okay,\n>> I'm still a little bit puzzled here. You\ncall it a package, but is surely it's\nit's it's not a whole bunch of code.\nSurely it's just some\n>> Oh, it is a bunch of code. It is a bunch\nof code. It is like\n>> So basic so basically the code and dev\nand the code and\n>> it's if you are familiar with\nKubernetes, we don't use Kubernetes. So\nit's like a Kubernetes Helm chart. Oh,\nokay. Okay. Sorry. I I read product as\nuh as production. Sorry. Sorry. I think\nthat's where I was confused.\n>> It's good you asked this because this is\nthe most common question I get about\nTerra constructs. Like sounds great, but\nhow do you actually use it? And that's\nwhat I try to focus on on this\npresentation.\n>> So yeah, you're saying that this is the\nmost common questions uh why of the\nthing.\n>> Yeah. So after I talk about all of the\ngreat things that you can, you know,\nthat you get because now you get these\nreally nice developer patterns or\nservice integration patterns.\n>> Now, now that you mentioned Atlantis,\nyeah, Atlantis is uh is great. I\nactually need to work out how to\nintroduce that into my into my uh\ncompany. M so I'm I'm I have a\ncustomuilt EMI and I have custom CDKTF\nworkflows and I want to for Terra\nconstructs and I want to publish my AMI\nas like the bootstrap for Terra\nConstruct. So if you want to start with\nTerra Constructs in your organization\nhere is your construct to bootstrapped\nAtlantis. So it deploys Atlantis with\nall of the settings for running CDKTF\nsynthesis to Terapform running Terapform\napply integration with your pull request\nand all that.\n>> That's my I mean if you yeah like if if\nyou\n>> but I don't have if your elevator pitch\nis basically how to use Atlantis with\nCDK I think I get it actually. My my\npitch is you want better devx for your\ndevelopers and most people are like\nuh it's complicated why do I need an\nadditional synthesis step how do I\nintegrate it into my Atlantis um I can't\ncontrol my developers and my engineers\nthey are very creative they create\nreally convoluted\ninfrastructure if I let them write them\nin typescript uh how do you control that\nwell that's where I think part of\nproduct like platform team is that you\nsurface is the pattern so that you can\nyou know with bootstraps so that you can\n>> so that you extract the convoluted\npatterns into reusable patterns I don't\nknow\n>> to keep the things align I mean the same\nthing with modules right people are\ngoing to write crazy modules\n>> it sounds like you are doing a a great\nthing in a sense like allowing the\nproduct team to use a code that's\nfamiliar to them but ultimately uh\nkeeping Terraformers\n>> the first class infrastructure uh uh\nDevX I think that makes a lot of sense\nactually\n>> I'm trying to bridge the platform team\nand the product team because the\nplatform team lives in breeds terapform\nthey have three years of you know code\nscanning they have their whatever maybe\nthey're not using Atlantis but they have\ntheir own GitHub workflows to run and\napply um their Terraform with pull\nrequest like PR reviews uh previews\nsorry yeah\n>> I I love what you just said there uh\nbuilding a bridge between platform and\nand product team though like I'm just\nalso mapping this to my current uh gig\nright now. I mean I think if I showed\nthem this at at my workplace they would\nbe terrified because we don't want\nproducts to develop to write\ninfrastructure as code. We want them to\nconfig like we want a very very tight\nconfiguration for them like all all\n>> find this funny because there's a saying\nis it from\nwe want products to be able to do what\nthey need to do without being blocked by\nplatform right platform must provide\ngolden paths must provide easy adoption\nfor the um for the cloud but they cannot\nbe the bottleneck they cannot be the\nones that are preventing\nthe team. Um,\n>> well, that's I I agree. I totally agree\nwith that. But like but in a in a\n>> uh Yeah, but in a in a but in a big\ncompany it it's not scalable.\nI I can see it making a thousand.\n>> No, that's why platform teams exist,\nright? Platform teams are supposed to\nprovide the tools so that you can keep\nit under control so that the product\nteams can still evolve. So you in like\nbig banks you will have like a\ndeclarative YAML config file that under\nthe hood sets up 10 different terraform\nmodules in just the right way so that\nthey get deploy uh what they need or\nmaybe use custom resources because\nyou're on Kubernetes or whatever right\nso this is from platform con 20 uh 2024\ntalk from Gregor Hop and he talks like\nnobody wants 80% of Dynamob like your\nmodule is not just like exposing sane\ndefaults as a better Dynamob under under\nthe hood, they still need the features\nof Dynamob and if your module doesn't\nexpose it, your module is not better,\nright? It's just it's just restricting\naccess to it. But it's\n>> that's a very that's very interesting.\nUh\ndid you ever meet Gregor? Because he\nused he lived in Singapore a few fair\nfew years.\n>> I was at a few conferences where he was\nas well, but I never really interacted\nmuch with him. Yeah, he he spoke at the\nAWS meetup, too. That this is very\ninteresting because like I think I mean\nI feel like I've been drinking through a\nstraw somehow because every every gig\nI'm on, we make a module to give give,\nyou know, 80% to the developer. And now\nyou're sort of you're sort of flipping\nthe table over here by saying that no\nyou're uh\nyour platform team should be allowing\nthem to do\n>> one of my previous CTOs at uh previous\ncompany he was ex AWS as well I don't\nthink he was in a technical role there\nbut he um basically had a lot of\nexperience on how they did things at AWS\nand he says the platform team's\nresponsibility is to put in guard rails\nthey're not the bottleneck they just\nneed to make sure that teams can do what\nthey need to do without shooting\nthemselves in the foot. So your job\nreally is put in place, you know, the\nthe scanners, the llinters and the\ndashboards around it. So if we do have a\nmisconfiguration, we can catch it as\nmost of the lift as possible.\n>> I mean, I'm I I'm fully behind that.\nLike so basically the platform team\nisn't uh producing modules, they're more\nlike producing confest type stuff,\nright? Or linting type stuff. But like\nI've just never seen\n>> but at the same time like the goal of\nthe platform team is to observe teams\nusage of the cloud and extract golden PS\nso that we can keep teams aligned so\nthat you know teams don't do completely\ndifferent things so that if a new team\nwants to start a new project they have a\ntech radar and they can figure out today\nthe recommended way of doing that is\nusing this golden path and if I follow\nthis golden path\n>> that definitely doesn't happen in my\ncurrent workplace like The idea is that\nis that uh we're laying the tracks\nbefore the product teams get there and\nuh hopefully it's the tracks that they\nwant to take which is something that\nI've always heard as a complaint around\nplatform teams and actually one company\nI worked at was very resistant and very\nagainst towards moving towards a\nplatform team they had embedded SRE\nthere was a huge um compliance\ninitiative and they completely refused\nbecause they were like you guys are\ngoing to be a bottleneck. You're going\nto prevent us to do what we want to do.\n>> And and to just to be clear, uh I as an\ninfrastructure engineer, I I hate\nplatform teams. The whole idea for me is\njust terrible. I'm more in favor of a\ncross functional embedded uh so uh\nembedded infrastructure engineer\npattern,\n>> but I always end up as the\ninfrastructure engineer in a platform\nteam essentially. Uh and the funny thing\nis I've been at a lot of organization\nthat try to push me towards in embedded\nSR role and I always end up completely\nwithdrawing myself from product and\nfocusing 100% on the cloud and the CI/CD\nand how to make a solution that\nstretches across all the teams and then\ncomplaining if people are not using it.\nSo I I have like the the opposite like\nhabits of view\n>> but I I try to really focus now like I\nwant to be part of the of the product\nteam. I want to be part of the road map\nbut it's very hard for me.\n>> There's some very interesting approaches\nhere. I mean can you I mean I can't\nclaim to I can't claim the current\nworking uh approach in my client is is\nsuccessful. I can't claim that at all\nbut it's very uh conservative and very u\nestablished way of doing things. Can you\nhonestly say to me, Vincent, that you've\nyou've worked with product teams and\nyou've given them a golden what did you\nsay? A golden\n>> golden path.\n>> A golden path and they loved it. I mean,\nthat sounds also kind of Let's be\nhonest.\n>> I did I say that I give them a golden\npath and they loved it.\n>> Well, I mean,\n>> I I did work at one organization.\n>> That's what you're alluding to, right?\nSo we did I did in in that same\norganization where they went full in on\nAWS CDK um where the platform team had a\nlot of Terraform. We had a very heavy\nKubernetes footprint and we built a\nGolang CLI that bootstrapped deployments\non top of Kubernetes and\nwe had the funny thing is we had like 40\nbrands and but it was behind it was\nalways this two teams and so it was very\neasy to roll it out across the teams and\nwe were able to like align all of the\nteams but we did get the feedback from\nthe CTO like I I didn't mean to create\nlike an isolated team that built the\nplatform and then another isolated and\nthen the product team. We want I wanted\nDevOps. I wanted you know embedded\nSRRES. I wanted you guys to to build on\nyou know for the product and I mean\nI don't know um we rolled it out we used\nit. It was we used Argo CD so it was\ngenerating all of the uh manifests for\nour GitOps and it was able to centralize\nthe Helm charts. So we had like the\nability to roll out and ch make changes.\nI think the biggest problem right when\npeople when teams move away from like\nembedded SRS towards platform teams is\ncompliance. When you start doing audits\nand sock 2 and all that then suddenly\nnow you have to integrate the zero trust\nall over the company. Now you certainly\nhave to have the you know bill of uh\nsoftware bill of material asbomb and you\nhave to track and you know provide audit\nreports that you are addressing uh\nvulnerabilities um on on time. You have\nto provide your full uh network\ninfrastructure and your firewall rules\nas a compliance audit report quarterly.\nYou have to have great glassass\nfunctionality. When all of that becomes\nimperative to the product teams,\nsuddenly you need to have a more\ncentralized approach towards managing\nyour infrastructure. And that's where\norganizations tend to then switch more\ntowards platform teams. That's also I\nthink one of Hashikcom's um\npresentations from like evolution of\nlike maturity. So all of the\norganizations start with this um\nno that's not what I wanted. I just\nwanted\n>> center view. Who who does that?\n>> Uh I'm clearly not a a dude that's used\nto make presentations. Anyway, so so\nstage one like singular teams, ad hoc\napproach, everyone does whatever they\nwant. Sing to standardizing, centralized\ndeploys, policy enforcement, team\ncollaborations, and then platform team\nself-service.\n>> Yeah. I'm I'm usually in that stage\nthree uh uh what do you call it journey?\nYeah.\n>> Yeah. So so and and that's also funny\nbecause like most Most startups or\norganizations don't hire DevOps until\nthey start hitting these centralization\nproblems, right? And then they're hiring\nDevOps because they have reliability\nissues. They have a disparity in\ntechnology stacks across different\nteams. They have no way of like rolling\nout compliance. Uh but the good thing is\nthey have money, they have revenue and\nso they can hire DevOps team which is\nDevOps. the whole idea of like being\nembedded in like breaking down the walls\nuh being doing agile now becomes no we\nactually are hiring a system\nadministration team to help us adopt the\ncloud and tame it and\n>> are you suggesting standardizing is uh\nis dev is is the embedded approach\nbecause\n>> no no no no standardizing is the\nplatform approach.\nYeah, because I thought\n>> a lot of organizations they will have um\n>> so so so so stage one so stage one is\nthe is the uh cross functional team\napproach right? Yeah. And then and then\nalready in stage two we have to have\n>> So what do you mean with cross\nfunctional? I think stage one is when\nevery team has like ah cross functional\nmeaning every team has a guy doing\nDevOps or the CI/CD.\n>> Yeah. Exactly.\n>> More like embedded. Right. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. It's interchangeable here to me.\nSo stage one is embedded because that's\nbecause we because at my my employ my my\nconsultancy employer we we always\nadvocate uh a cross functional embedded\nuh infrastructure engineer but it never\nreally happens for one reason or another\nas I mentioned. So and that's already\nstage one. I feel that's that's kind of\nfrightening because there's a very\ninteresting book that one of a candidate\nI interviewed pointed me out. I think he\nworked at works as well. He told me that\nto read team topologies which is there's\nan evolution of the teams and and how\nyou like there's there's an in between\nthere's like fully embedded everyone\ndoes its own there's like platform at\ncomplete opposite and then there's like\na cross like a lot of like bandwidth\nbetween um how you may have\n>> because because this diagram doesn't\nseem to even it's it's either like\n>> yeah no this is a sales pitch from Hashi\nCorp which sells a platform solution\nright\n>> yeah I get it I get Uh yeah, so this was\na original slideshow that I made for\nbefore I started Terra Constructs which\nwas the idea was to make something\ncalled the environment toolkit and I\ndon't know why I cannot zoom in uh zoom\nout anymore. Um but basically\nthe problem is that we have two personas\nin a lot of organizations. We have\nproduct teams, we have platform teams.\nWell, there's a few others, but like uh\nand the idea was like the app team, they\nare the ones that need the like a very\nnice interface. They should\n>> if you just give them YAML without any\nschema, then they may shoot them, they\nmay not really know how it works. Um and\nand it's not a very nice experience for\nthem, but that's commonly what's done\ntoday, which is like you give them a\nYAML spec file that they have to fill in\nand then under the hood, the platform\nteam builds the actual modules. like you\nsay they set the path they they\n>> the things right um\n>> why do you say why do you say it's not\nvery nice\n>> cuz well\n>> I think YL is not very nice\n>> well I mean it's I mean it's a lot\neasier than them bloody writing code CDK\nlet's be honest\n>> why is the file read only this is my\nfile\n>> and maybe maybe a separate comp\n>> sorry did you say again about what's not\nvery nice.\n>> The the YAML driven\nuh product team. What's wrong with that?\n>> Um the problem with YAML is that\nif you miss a space, you get an error.\nIf you you don't know exactly where\n>> use pickle, guys.\n>> No, you should use a proper programming\nlanguage. Stop inventing all these\nadditional like Q and um what's the\nother ones? JSON net and like there's a\nthousands of them there's a hundreds of\nthem and all of them have the same\nproblem\n>> but they become a programming language\nultimately in the end all of them become\nprogramming languages\n>> during that conf\nI I I met some Apple engineers and they\nwere they pitched pickle and I was\nconvinced that pickle is the is is a\nreally good way of uh\n>> yeah so so that that's what I'm trying\nto say with this thing here um there's a\nwhole bunch of like you just told me the\nIDE experience. Does Spickle have a nice\nIDE in terms?\n>> It does. Unfortunately, it seems to\n>> Wrong example.\n>> They they seem to favor Jet Brains, but\nuh you know\n>> Oh, so anyway, does Pickle have a proper\npackage manager and registry?\n>> Yes. Yes.\n>> It's so good. It's so good.\n>> This is is pickle touring complete?\n>> I think so. Yes.\n>> Wrong. Copic language shouldn't be too\nincomplete.\n>> Then why are you not writing it in\nGolang?\n>> Uh you can't expect people to pick up\nGolang.\n>> Yeah. So So\n>> Pickle's designed to\n>> for one task in mind. Uh is explained to\nme by by the um the Apple engineer. He\nsays like uh you know you need it's the\nalarm has gone up gone off. It's 2:00\na.m. and you need to make that change\nsafely.\nSo, so essentially you're logging into\nthat m to that machine at 2 a.m. and\nmaking a config change that you could\nliterally cannot mess up.\n>> Okay. Well, I don't know why I'm getting\nthese results here, but it says the\nlearning curve is really difficult. It\nhas a GVM depend because I entered why\nyou should not use pickle.\n>> That's actually a very good answer. U\nyeah that that's that's very good\nanswer. like but yeah you're right it\ndoes require JVM but uh you know I can\nlook past that\nand it it does have a learning curve but\nlike oh my god I mean\n>> it's enhance safety and maintainability\nit's reduced duplication it's\nabstraction of modality to me pickle\nsounds like JSON net like why why should\nI use pickle and not JSON net\n>> JSON is horrible when I last looked at\nit\n>> yeah so agree like I never really got\nJSON at properly. Um, so\n>> also very very both like pickle's very\ntight actually. It looks looks and reads\nvery nicely.\n>> Uh,\n>> I may have to play with it. But I have\nmy my reason to get into Terra\nconstructs and Typescript was\nspecifically because TypeScript is\neverywhere. Uh, it's that's one of my my\nmy\ntenets in life\n>> but still but still\n>> the last five years\n>> I I I don't think I can get behind. I\nmean, I can maybe you're working with\nstartups, but I still think\n>> product teams maybe I've been working\nfor too many big companies and stuff.\n>> Product teams shouldn't be writing uh\nCDK. It's going to get crazy real quick.\n>> That's always like when I talk about\nthis is a standard reply. Startups\nshouldn't be writing CD like product\nengineers shouldn't be touching infra\ncode and\n>> I mean I mean startups and midsize\ncompanies I think it's actually pretty\nquite good but if you're like a large\nheavily regulated industry that's never\ngoing to fly\n>> and I I think at that point you don't\nask the product engineer to write it but\nyou give the platform engineer the right\ntools to build better extractions for\nthe pro for the product engineer. there\nbecause again like this is what we\ntalked about last time as well. There's\nthis deck CDK\nwhich gives you the ability to build a a\nstrict types like strongly typed schema\nYAML um interface or front end which\nPulumi also has which is like\n>> it reminds me of the the serverless\napplication.\n>> Oh yes like SLA SAML\n>> uh not SAML sorry SAM. Oh yeah.\nServerless applica. What is the end\nserver?\n>> I've been doing too much authorization\nand authentication.\n>> Yeah. So, so but but this is a bit\nfunny, right? Because it kind of like\ngives you the L2 con L2 or L3 construct\nas a YAML uh composition thing.\n>> Actually, I I love it. I love it. It\nworks for me like uh nine out of 10\ntimes.\n>> And and I think that's kind of the\nexperience that we can build on top of\nTerra constructs or CDKF. basically a\nfront end question right under the hood\nlike docker file is a front end they\ncompletely reworked uh docker as well\nlike docker file does is not the\nstandard like you can have different\nfront ends you can have a yaml front end\nyou can have an other front end because\nnow you're building actual proper\nprogramming objects that can you know\nbind themselves and evolve and can be\nconfigured differently you're not stuck\nwith static terraform modules that you\nthen have to bunch put a whole bunch of\ngo templating around because you're\nasking you're giving your engineers um a\nYAML interface to basically configure\nmodules under the hood. That's what I\nhear banks do, right? And and it's the\nsame with with Kubernetes. That's\nexactly what Helm is. You're just\nputting Go templating around bunch of\nYAML, which is Kubernetes um resource\ndefinitions or manifests, right? And and\nand\nwe see where that goes. We see a Helm\nchart with like a values.yamel where you\nhave no idea how that gets, you know,\ninterpolated by the gold templates under\nthe hood. The gold templates are\nextremely complicated with like\n>> well\n>> too much logic within the template\nengine.\n>> That's why I showed you that Terraform\nproject that I was cooking up the other\nday because because I use pickle and and\nwhen you run it through pickle you can\nsee the pickle schema. You can see your\npickle. You can see how it it it becomes\nTerraform JSON. But why do I have to\nlearn a new language when Typescript is\nalready a TypeScript compiler that gives\nme strong typing and capabilities like\nPickle except I don't have to learn\nPickle and I can just run TypeScript.\n>> Well, the thing that I like about it is\nthat it's clear to me\nwhat\nwhat is the entry point into Terraform\nwhen I'm writing in Pickle. It's it's\nvery it's clear as day. But if you're\nwriting CDK\nuh and using Terra constructs, then then\nyou you really don't know what the\nTerraform resources are going to look\nlike until the\n>> No, that's not the same thing as what\nyou just started the sentence with. You\nsaid you you you know the entry point\nand then you say you don't know what's\ngoing to look like. That is a very\ndifferent\nI know the entry point when I use CDK. I\nknow exactly how this is going to get\ninvoked uh because I have a strongly\ntyped interface now that is defined\nunder TypeScript and TypeScript compiles\nto JSON schema. So I can expose that\ntyped interface as a with a JSON schema\non top of a YAML file and then my\nengineers can write YAML uh except they\nget an error message if they don't put\nthe field in the right place or if they\nhave a typo or if they put misplace a a\nspace. Maybe you get the same with\npickle because you get a strongly typed\npickle file or pickle config. But you\nget exactly the same with TypeScript.\nYou can expose it as a JSON schema and\nyou can allow people to provide config\nfiles and you can control the entry\npoints.\n>> Okay. Okay. I I might have misspoke here\nbut what I'm trying to say is that the\nthe translation is is more is more uh\nstraightforward in my mind because\n>> but then you're not dealing with\ncomplicated terapform configurations.\nYou're probably I I need to know exactly\nwhat is a terapform configuration.\n>> Yeah. I mean, am I rec\nI'm just I'm just mapping it into a\nmodule and you're right when you when\nyou in your example when you're messing\naround with API gateway or or lambda\n>> which is a realistic cloud because you\njust cloud workloads because what you\njust said this is what we all use and\nterapform modules are horrible at it and\nthen you're going to have to write\npickle to wrap the horrible terapform\nexperience which is very limited because\nit only has like 40 different variable\ninputs the outputs are not even typed\nyou write pickle again to do that. But\nhow about we go back to the source? How\nabout we build a proper L2 construct and\nthen we they know how to bind each\nother. And this example here, these 230\nlines of Terraform is not to tell you\nlike this is what you're going to work\nwith. This is to show you the complexity\nand the ugliness of what's under the\nhood.\n>> This is what you write.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And this is a well-known pattern because\nthis is actually the AWS CDK pattern.\nThis is literally the CDK workshop\nexample except it's on my landing page\nand now it spits out terraform.\nI I think it I think it it definitely\nmakes sense to empower product teams,\nbut I I I keep on going back to the to\nthe thought that in a in a heavy\nregulated company, you you would have to\njust give them a very locked down uh\n>> Yeah. And that's where a platform team\nwould need to build using these\nconstructs instead of these modules\nactually with a proper programming\nlanguage.\n>> Um they would be able to build what they\nneed.\n>> Okay. So the platform team uses terror\nconstructs to create the golden paths\n>> for example. Yes. Um like the pattern\nhere that I showed on the other slide uh\nwhich was\nI'm allowing my teams to deploy onto\nFargate and we use an application load\nbalancer. In our case the application\nload balancer is part of the landing\nzone. So they must import it using from\napplication load balancer attributes.\nMaybe I can wrap all of that up in as my\nsample app. um you know Typescript\ninterface. So you must provide the\nnecessary attributes to import the load\nbalancer, the VPC and the cluster. And\nthis is a strongly typed interface of\nwhat are my my integration points?\n>> Okay. And then how complete is Terra\nConstructs? Do you do you support like\neverything CDK throws at it or is it\nlike some\n>> No, no, no. So, so I started with like\nevery single AWS module that is in AWS\nCDK and more moving it over into on top\nof Terraform and that's been very\nmanual. Then I also used LLMs to\nautomate that process. But I still need\nto write all of the unit tests. I need\nto write all of the integration tests. I\nneed to validate everything.\n>> So just you're just getting started sort\nof thing. I mean\n>> like a year getting started. Um, so at\nthis point I I I'm focused on building\nthe the features that I need at my\norganization, right? Um, what what I\nwant\n>> that's a great slide deck actually. I\nreally like that.\n>> Yeah. What what I want\nat this point if people are interested\nthey should reach out and they say like\ngreat we use Fargate a lot. I don't see\nFargate right now. Like this pattern\nthat I show here it's a little asterisk\nat the bottom there. pending the ECS\npattern module public release. So this\nis not in Terra construct integrated\nyet. I need to make that public.\n>> Just just very quickly why why Fargate\ninstead of uh serverless? It just there\nneeded to be persistent.\n>> We use a lot of serverless at at my\norganization and um at some point\nthere's longunning job like services\nthat you need to run and better to run\nthem in containers\n>> without the whole Kubernetes\n>> um complexity. So we use Terraform a\nlot.\n>> I'm with you. I'm with you. Kubernetes\nis such a nightmare.\n>> So it's very funny because when we met,\nI was running the Docker and Kubernetes\nmeetups and you would tell me like why\ndon't you just use Compose? It's so much\nsimpler. And I would be like Compose\ndoesn't have all the dials and knobs\nthat you need and Kubernetes is like\nproperly designed and easy.\n>> This this must have been years ago.\n>> Yeah. 2017 maybe. Yeah. Well, oh, well,\nthat's back when uh what was that? Core\nOS. I love core OS. Don't know what\nhappened to it.\n>> They were acquired by IBM. Now there's a\nflat car Linux. It was fully integrated.\nNo, they were acquired by Redhead and\nRedhead was acquired by IBM, right?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, so Coras was acquired by\nRedhead. All of the core OS projects\nsuch as tectonic were integrated within\nopen shift and then they replaced like\nthe CentOS or whatever the Redhead\ncontainer Linux became was rebranded\nCoros really really so all of the\nCororez like um systemd integrations\nwhich ultimately systemd is a redhead\nproject as well right um core was 100%\nbuilt on top of systemd\n>> so the so so then some of the original\ncororos people that were not part of the\nacquisition or some people involved with\nthe project created flat car Linux. I\ndon't know where that went, but um today\num Talos is super interesting because\nthey're they're taking this whole like\nexposing the the the Linux\nadministration\nsurface completely through the API,\nwhich was another OS also had this idea.\nI don't know if it was Talos, but there\nwas another one doing the same thing.\n>> Not sure what what Talos is. Sounds like\na security product.\n>> Uh Talos. Talos. Talos.\nBut anyway, just to to defend my Oh, you\nknow what it is. Yeah, and I think I\nknow what it is. Yeah.\n>> Yeah, they just have a new landing zone\nuh landing page. Sorry.\n>> They expose\n>> But going going back to my going back I\nI don't remember talking to you about\nDocker Compose, but I think actually\nDocker Compose is one of those\ntechnologies that I I still regularly\nuse and love.\n>> Oh yes, absolutely. It's just when when\nDocker tried to take it and replace it\nwith Swarm, right? They they like,\n>> \"Oh that was a show.\"\n>> No, nobody liked Swarm. Um, so so yeah,\ndoctor time with it.\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay. I think we need to somehow end\nthis uh because I'm uh but I\n>> getting tired running out of time.\n>> I did really really enjoy this. I think\nwe covered a lot of things. I think\nmaybe I'm in the right. Okay, one more\nthing.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–7:56]\nto uh the value add on Terraform. As by means of introduction, Vincent and I are seasoned infrastructure engineers and the following is a conversation where we talk about Terraform CDK infrastructurees code and I think it's the best conversation I've ever had about platform teams. It's a bit of a slow burn. I hope you enjoy it. like the video. Um, and I recommend listening this to this in in a car. You don't need to look at the screen. I I did capture an angle of me from the side, which I think is a bit unflattering. Uh, so you don't need to watch this. We we do try share the the screen and browse to the things that we talk about, but essentially I feel this is a podcast format. You don't need to watch the video, but the video helps. Do please enjoy and comment below. >> See you. >> Why did I rebuild it? I probably didn't even need to rebuild it. Okay, so the value on top of Terapform. Um last time we talked about a lot of drama around the cloud providers and the way that you manage Terraform state and the resource under um under management pricing that's exuberant and then some drama around some open source projects and I'm very excited about them because I have my own open source project which is focused on strongly typed terraform right um originally terraform >> I mean just to interrupt you I mean like terraform is pretty typed I mean you have your strings, you have your default values, you have your >> strings, >> strings for enum values. >> Uh, okay. You have strings, strings, strings. No, you have um I'm sure you have integers. I'm I'm sure. >> No, no, but the problem is >> you have reg x you have uh you have stuff, right? >> Yeah. So, Terraform basically is built on the concept of plugins or providers for a for clouds and cloud or for pro for SAS or whatever services cloud services that give you an API where you can create resources such as AWS creates gives you an EC2 API where you can create an EC2 uh resource, right? And that was very good and well um you know 10 years ago where you just needed to create a VPC couple of subnets an instance or an autoscaling group and the number of knobs and dials that you could configure were not that much but then you start to having like life cycle hoots on autoscaling groups that works with lambdas and you have SNS topics and you have a lot of different services and different integration patterns between them right the cloud became way more complex uh a lot more serverless is now being part of a lot of the…\n\n[slide:2] [7:36–23:22]\n>> but lambda and cloudatch should be a uh what do you call it a fixed pattern or something like that >> it changes a lot and and and it's funny because sometimes it could be very simple like you have a situation where you want a lambda to be triggered on an event bridge rule and you can simply go to the lambda and say async config and then say on success and then it will you know trigger another lambda or something else right and if you do a very simple like lambda chaining and you can do that directly on the lambda resource it works until you have a use case and that's a very fixed pattern but then you have a use case where now when the lambda success happens you want to extract some field from the um success event like you need to get the actual um I don't know result field from the ext JSON of that success event and you want to get the extract the payload like extract a certain payload then suddenly you can't do that with async evoke that's not possible with the way that the the lambda API works and you must use event bridge rules so you're very use like very simple pattern of like integrating two things together which should always be the same thing no longer works because now you have an event bridge rules that like match messes up your whole like situation because you need to parse the payload of the event and get out one field. And that's an example that I learned because I wrote a library to to implement um these integration patterns from AWS CDK on top of Terraform. And so I saw that like this is very this is an integration test actually that they have on their Lambda function integration. Um >> okay. Okay. >> Yeah. So >> I can show you the the actual running code for that. >> Okay. So so you're just showing some Lambda REST API. That's actually quite interesting because uh we we we use that a lot at work. >> Yeah. So so that's where the reality of the cloud today is that people are using these type of patterns more and more and and that's also because you want to you know leverage the cloud to accelerate your business feature delivery. So you can't be like completely decoupled from the cloud. You start to be really ingrained and integrated with the cloud features. Even though a lot of original cloud adoption was like we want to be cloud agnostic, Kubernetes is great. The reality is even if you use Kubernetes, you're going to have a whole bunch of custom resources just for AWS um to use to to to integrate with the cloud that you run. at at work…\n\n[slide:3] [23:02–38:49]\n>> because I I I mean yeah to be honest at work clients are for example this client I'm working with >> has been using CDK and to be honest >> it's been fine I mean I I can get behind it there's some quality of things that I hate about CDK like it doesn't seem to be able to plan >> so that's why Terra constructs would be great >> yeah uh so um but besides that um one of the one of the technologies that they bought bought into is a is a database and the the only official uh >> provider is >> provider is terraform. So they're basically >> those are all cloud form limitations. >> So basically they're stuck because they have to they have to start using terraform. So at the moment their pipeline like looks like you know CDK deploy and then do your Terraform um applying cool beans but but of course the question in my mind is like okay we can't just keep on using CDK and keep uh and then and then use Terraform as a baseline. We have to think about like >> aligning things. >> Yeah, aligning things. So, so I and yeah, we talked about it before, I'm sure, but like I think Terraform is the the de facto winner of the day when it comes to IA probably for the next god knows how many years >> mainly due to adoption. >> Yeah. Um >> yeah so >> I say that and yeah so so where does CDK fit in with this the fact that Terraform is is definitely not going away >> and it's got that sort of mind share uh you know >> so at some organizations I worked >> the expectation was that the team decides what they want to use if they want to use CDK they can the platform team had three years of platform team stuff so we were bootstrapping VPCs EKS clusters everything with with Terraform And so we just had to provide integration points that is kind of painful for um because you now have to deal with like different execution engines you know cloud formation and so on. It can work if the team takes full ownership of their CDK stack. Um but the moment yeah I've also had experiences where a team has full ownership on their stack and then half the team leaves and one guy is left to maintain it and he was supposed to like work on really cool data engineering stuff and now he has to maintain an airflow cluster and he hates it. This sounds very accurate like too many details like where does that come from? >> Yeah. Uh I know what you mean with airflow. I mean the whole MWA airflow 3.0 I don't know if you know about that. That's amaz >> I haven't used it for the last five years. >> Okay. Well,…\n\n[slide:4] [38:28–54:13]\nprovider. But there is a difference. >> How did we even get here? Oh my god. We talked about ter we talked about ter constructs. We talked about why >> we started with spec kit. We started we started with spec kit and how it like formalizes or gives you workflow to do your LLM work like um development. We talked about some evolution in the cloud code budget thing. We talked about you then asked me more about um like more about to towards Terraform and why I built something like Terra constructs. I think so. I gave some examples about the evolution of the cloud, the fact that it changed and became so complex and that the integration patterns between the services are complex and therefore a simple config file or terform module doesn't do it anymore. So that's where um I also give you examples of why the AWS CDK is so great. We talked a little bit about like it not really being maintained but there's still being a lot of new features being added. But but with Terra Constructs, I thought I I saw it as a way as as as migrating it. Now that I'm speaking with you at length, it sounds like you are not thinking like that. You're thinking that you're going to still leverage CDK, but your output is going to be Terraform. >> No. So, so there isn't an a project from Hashi Cororp that puts uh a host service a host um pro object around AWS CDK and then encapsulates the process like when AWS CDK generates something it then generates the Terraform. I'm not doing that. That's the adapter project and I don't believe it can achieve the actual functionality required. Okay. And we talked and that's why we ended up talking about AWS CC because it uses that AWS CC provider that not so many people use that you know doesn't have all of this ecosystem tooling around it and and that doesn't like allow you I I believe like I talked to some people behind the project and they told me that it's really just for early stage companies like quickly want to you know prototype how moving towards Terapform would help them maybe get them halfway there like you know have existing AWS CDK programs and put like a crud cr grudge around it. So, so you understand what I'm saying? It's called the AWS adapter and um but it's not like a long-term solution for um for your Yeah, it's called the AWS adapter for CDK. And as far as I understand, it's not something like if you start Greenfield, you should start, oh, I'm going to write a CDK and I'm going to use the adapter. I'm going to be using Terraform.…\n\n[slide:5] [53:52–01:09:40]\nis that this becomes an a layer of indirection and becomes stale like how do you you know keep it up to date? How do you know that the value has changed? How do you notify also because it's a layer of interaction how do you have direct connectivity between provider and consumer? How do you know everyone that consumes that key if you don't have like a an actual like point po point po point po point po point po point po point po point po point po point po point pointer counting like if you do this in memory you will you keep track of how many um actual variables point to the stack right so you have some counter and then you can know if anyone is still reading it and so none of that right and so when you start it sounds very simple and I was very confident I did this presentation I say this solves all of our problems but at that time I already realized that like having some type of generics around it so that we and type when we read it back out is actually really nice. Um, but that never really happened, right? Our teams had written a whole bunch of stuff into SSM parameter store and then we couldn't really keep track of like who was consuming it. I also thought that this was great that this was a a read indirection layer because now it meant that I could move things around and then just update the registry from different places. Big mistake because you have no idea where it comes from. So, so this pattern um is why I did not like my teams to use cloud formation and then adopt some type of indirection layer to communicate with them, right? So, I actually tried to roll this out and I had my landing zone publish all of its like integration points into the SSM parameter store. Uh and then you get other problems like how do you control the consumer permissions or who can write to these keys? How do you, you know, do you cross-ost like do you do you have a central one or do you have this one provider right to different accounts where they have to find it? So, there's a lot of of of problems there and I decided I'm just going to get rid of this whole problem by just using the native built-in Terapform stack feature which is, you know, Terraform outputs. Right. >> Right. I mean, I'm just thinking I'm just mapping this to my own experience about a registry. I think the one at my workplace that we ended up just doing is is essentially we keep a huge a like a a source of truth a JSON file in GitHub and we use that to sort of coordinate a lot of stuff because like hey…\n\n[slide:6] [01:09:20–01:17:54]\nusage of the cloud and extract golden PS so that we can keep teams aligned so that you know teams don't do completely different things so that if a new team wants to start a new project they have a tech radar and they can figure out today the recommended way of doing that is using this golden path and if I follow this golden path >> that definitely doesn't happen in my current workplace like The idea is that is that uh we're laying the tracks before the product teams get there and uh hopefully it's the tracks that they want to take which is something that I've always heard as a complaint around platform teams and actually one company I worked at was very resistant and very against towards moving towards a platform team they had embedded SRE there was a huge um compliance initiative and they completely refused because they were like you guys are going to be a bottleneck. You're going to prevent us to do what we want to do. >> And and to just to be clear, uh I as an infrastructure engineer, I I hate platform teams. The whole idea for me is just terrible. I'm more in favor of a cross functional embedded uh so uh embedded infrastructure engineer pattern, >> but I always end up as the infrastructure engineer in a platform team essentially. Uh and the funny thing is I've been at a lot of organization that try to push me towards in embedded SR role and I always end up completely withdrawing myself from product and focusing 100% on the cloud and the CI/CD and how to make a solution that stretches across all the teams and then complaining if people are not using it. So I I have like the the opposite like habits of view >> but I I try to really focus now like I want to be part of the of the product team. I want to be part of the road map but it's very hard for me. >> There's some very interesting approaches here. I mean can you I mean I can't claim to I can't claim the current working uh approach in my client is is successful. I can't claim that at all but it's very uh conservative and very u established way of doing things. Can you honestly say to me, Vincent, that you've you've worked with product teams and you've given them a golden what did you say? A golden >> golden path. >> A golden path and they loved it. I mean, that sounds also kind of Let's be honest. >> I did I say that I give them a golden path and they loved it. >> Well, I mean, >> I I did work…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This detailed conversation between two seasoned infrastructure engineers explores the evolving landscape of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the technical limitations of Terraform, and the organizational challenges of building effective platform teams. The discussion centers on the transition from simple configuration files to complex programmatic abstractions and the introduction of \"Terra Constructs,\" a project designed to bring the developer experience of AWS CDK to the Terraform ecosystem.\n\n[slide:1]\n## The Evolution and Complexity of Terraform\nTerraform was originally built on the concept of plugins and providers to manage cloud resources like VPCs and subnets. A decade ago, the number of \"knobs and dials\" for these resources was limited, making a simple configuration file sufficient. However, as the cloud evolved to include serverless components, SNS topics, and complex integration patterns, Terraform's declarative nature began to struggle. To keep up, the language introduced programmatic features like for_each loops, list comprehensions, and local blocks. This has led to the creation of massive community modules that often feature over 45 variables and complex tertiary conditionals, making it difficult for engineers to understand how variables interact or trickle down into resource configurations. *the cloud became way more complex... a lot more serverless is now being part of a lot of the tech stack* Originally, Terraform aimed to be \"dumb\" to prevent users from shooting themselves in the foot, but the reality of modern cloud architecture has forced a level of complexity that a simple config file can no longer easily manage.\n\n[slide:2]\n## The Serverless Integration Challenge\nProvisioning AWS Lambda functions in raw Terraform is often a \"nightmarish\" experience because the provider only covers the bare minimum resources required by the API. Engineers must manually configure Lambda permissions, IAM roles, and CloudWatch logging groups, then explicitly bind them together. This lack of high-level abstraction is particularly painful in serverless environments where business logic is spread across multiple components. AWS CDK solves this by providing \"constructs\" that understand service integration patterns. For example, a single line of CDK code can handle an entire asset pipeline—bundling code, uploading it to S3, and ensuring the Lambda can access it. Terra Constructs is an attempt to port these high-level developer experiences to Terraform, allowing engineers to use TypeScript to define complex patterns like Lambda chaining or EventBridge rules while still outputting standard Terraform resources. This approach recognizes that in the serverless world, infrastructure and business logic are too tightly coupled to be managed through decoupled, low-level configuration files.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Organizational Realities and Refactoring\nTerraform remains the dominant tool for Infrastructure as Code due to its massive industry adoption and mindshare. In many organizations, platform teams use Terraform to bootstrap core infrastructure like VPCs and EKS clusters, while product teams may prefer the flexibility of CDK. This creates a need for \"aligning things\" and providing clear integration points between different execution engines. A central theme of the discussion is refactoring, which is described as a pivotal part of infrastructure management. As projects grow, resources often need to be moved from a single project into shared layers or owned by a dedicated platform team. Without the ability to refactor stacks easily, organizations end up with \"stale\" infrastructure or projects that are impossible to deprecate because of hidden dependencies. The speakers also touch on the AWS Project Development Kit (PDK) and tools like CDK DIA, which can generate high-level diagrams to help teams visualize the intent and meaning behind their infrastructure constructs, a feature that is notoriously difficult to achieve with standard Terraform modules.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Terra Constructs vs. Existing Adapters\nThe conversation dives into the technical differences between Terra Constructs and other tools like HashiCorp's CDKTF or the AWS Adapter for CDK. While CDKTF provides the foundation for using TypeScript with Terraform, it lacks the high-level service integration patterns (Level 2 constructs) found in AWS CDK. The AWS Adapter for CDK attempts to map CloudFormation resources to Terraform using the AWS Cloud Control API, but this often results in a loss of functionality. The Cloud Control API is autogenerated and sometimes lacks the \"curated\" experience of the manually maintained AWS provider. For instance, the manual provider can hide the complexity of \"JSON patches\" required by certain API Gateway endpoints, providing a much cleaner interface for the user. Terra Constructs aims to bridge this gap by reimplementing core CDK features—like asset bundling and IAM principle management—directly on top of the popular, manually maintained Terraform AWS provider. This ensures that existing ecosystem tools for linting, security scanning, and cost calculation still work perfectly while providing a superior developer experience.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Integration Registries and State Management\nA major point of contention in infrastructure engineering is how to handle dependencies between different teams and stacks. The engineers discuss the \"Integration Registry\" pattern, often implemented using AWS SSM Parameter Store, where one team publishes resource IDs for others to consume. While this sounds simple, it frequently leads to a \"recipe for disaster\" because it introduces a layer of indirection that can become stale. There is often no way to track which consumers are reading a specific key, making it dangerous to change or delete values. The speakers suggest that a better approach is using native Terraform outputs or even a centralized JSON file in a Git repository to coordinate secrets and account details. This provides a clear change log and avoids the \"sprawl\" associated with arbitrary SSM paths. The goal is to maintain direct connectivity between providers and consumers to ensure that infrastructure changes are predictable and visible across the entire organization.\n\n[slide:6]\n## The Philosophy of Modern Platform Teams\nThe discussion concludes with a debate on the role of platform teams versus embedded SREs. While some engineers prefer a cross-functional, embedded approach, the reality of large, regulated organizations often necessitates a centralized platform team to handle compliance, auditing, and \"zero trust\" initiatives. The \"golden path\" is presented as the ideal solution: the platform team provides standardized, highly-functional tools and guardrails that allow product teams to move quickly without being blocked. *platform team's responsibility is to put in guard rails they're not the bottleneck they just need to make sure that teams can do what they need* This involves moving away from \"restricting\" access through limited modules and instead focusing on \"observing\" team usage to extract and share successful patterns. Whether using TypeScript, YAML, or specialized configuration languages like Pkl, the objective remains the same: empowering developers to own their infrastructure while maintaining the security and reliability standards required by the business. The engineers emphasize that platform teams should be \"laying the tracks\" for product teams, ensuring that the easiest path to production is also the most compliant and stable one."
