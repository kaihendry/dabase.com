    "content": "Transcript:\nI thought we could maybe cover all the\nAI news.\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of AI news again,\nright? I don't know. We didn't talk much\nabout AI for the the week. So, what are\nall the news items?\n>> Yeah, I I mean I I was I was trying to\nbring our CDKTF discussion around to AI,\nbut uh whatever. I mean kind of in a way\nthat how we see high high level or you\nknow the point is like using AI to with\nhigher level libraries and that's your\npreamble probably from that you want to\nadd\num but yeah anyway\n>> because AI because AI will will work\nbetter with abstractions you mean or\nwhat do you suggest what are you saying\n>> it's what I feel like yeah that I mean I\nthink abstract deterministic\nabstractions\nallow you to work better like than um\nthan reinventing the wheel every time,\nright?\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I'm just\nthinking\nof a\nsilly example where\nAI would have to manage a lambda\ndeployment on Terraform which\nwhich I which I'd actually be surprised\nif if AI can do because it's\nnon-trivial, isn't it really\nto do humans struggle with this, right?\nTo to do a Terraform deployment of a\ntypical Lambda function.\nYeah, but but if it is a high level, it\nit should reduce the context. It should\nmake things more and that's what skills\nand all that stuff do, right? It it\nbasically\ngives you operate. It gives you uh how\ndo you do this like I think there was a\ntalk about this from anthropic. I don't\nwant mahes to figure out the 2025 tax\ncode from first principles. I need\nconsistent execution from from a domain\nexpert. Asians today are a lot like\nMahes. They're brilliant, but they lack\nexpertise.\nThey can do no more slow. They can do\namazing things when you really put in\neffort and give proper guidance, but\nthey're often missing the important\ncontext up front. They can't really\nabsorb your expertise super well and\nthey don't learn over time.\n>> Yeah. But what I think is more exciting\nbecause we did quite a few talks about\nspecit and um the process that is within\nspecit and then google now announcing\nconductor which introduces the very\nsimilar um steps as in specit. Yeah,\nlike it does seem almost a bit too\nsimilar\nlike it does mention the different there\nare differentiators here like the the\nsupport for brownfield project but they\ndon't really go into details do they?\nSo, I've been having problems with\nGemini. Um, when I give Gemini a\nproblem, it immediately starts changing\ncode. And I find it very interesting to\nsee the prompts that Google prepared to\n>> Gemini.\n>> Uh, yeah. So, yeah, exactly. No, it's\nit's it's different. I can share my\nscreen. Um, basically, if you enable\nshare, I can share the screen because I\nhave them um cloned side by side. Um,\n>> oh, nice.\n>> So, I have versus conductor.\n>> Yes, I think this is a very\n>> So, we have we also have Kira. Uh, what\nelse do we have?\n>> Can I share my screen?\n>> Screen zero. I would guess\nthis is uh I use Arch by the way.\n>> Yeah, you're rolling your eyes.\n>> You need to do something about your\nvideo, man. Your It's like one frame per\nsecond over here.\nmy my my video my face.\n>> Yeah,\n>> you look like\n>> it's a slideshow.\n>> Okay, so now this\num Okay, so here we have uh specify\nand cloud command.\n>> Do do command plus or control plus or\nwhat do you do?\n>> It's a bit small.\n>> So the first Okay, I'm going to I'm\ngoing to open it and zoom in. Um\nokay\n>> better\n>> can you see the file tree sufficiently\nand\n>> yeah yeah\n>> let's close this terminal\n>> okay\nso\nwhen you use spec kit one of the first\nthing you do is you define the\nconstitution right and then when you do\nthe constitution you identify the rules\nfor this particular project or product\nthat you're building so when when that\nhappens it creates It's a memory file\ncalled constitution and in this\nparticular report this is a constitution\nfor my terra constructs uh landing page\nand these are the core principles. So\nthis guides the LLM on how to you know\ncreate a plan and how to subdivide the\nplan and how to prioritize tasks and how\nto yeah so to make sure that like what\ntechnology it doesn't really go much\ninto the technology but like it says we\nneed formatting uh we need u we don't\nhave any automated testing on this\nwebsite at the moment so that's okay if\nyou say always automate always put\nautomated testing then the LLM will make\nsure that the plan has those tasks but\nin this case it's like we're doing\nmanual validation so we're asking the\nuser to validate\nUm, and so that's what what spec does in\nthe constitution and it contains\ndoesn't really say your spec your\ntechnical stack and everything. So if we\ncompare that to what the the conductor\nstarts with the conductor\nhas some code style guides and so on but\nit has under the Gemini skills where's\nmy Gemini skills here. Uh, sorry my\nGemini commands there is the setup\nphase. Okay. And the first thing when it\nstarts is it it will create a JSON\ndocument. So this is something\ninteresting that um specit does not do\nwhich is specit will separate every\nasset or artifact and every process like\na command will be a different command\nwhich will generate markdown. But when\nwith Gemini tree, Google is using a\nseparate JSON file and this one prompt\nwill identify which step it is within\nthe the the JSON file and then proceed\nfrom there. So it makes like it's like a\nmultiflow single prompt. So one prompt\nwill you know will determine what state\nit is like the it's like a state machine\nwith like different functions and the\nLLM will decide what to do next based on\nwhat you did last.\n>> Okay. Well, it's like a it's more of a\ndata structure. It's like a link list,\nright? It's it sets up.\n>> Yeah. Which is already\n>> another file,\n>> right? And and that means that like for\nexample, if you do new track, the first\nthing it says like have we defined the\ntext stack, the workflow and the\nproduct. So this equates to the\nconstitution.\nOkay. So the text tack is like this\nproduct is using this particular text\ntag and it is always following this\nworkflow and it is this is the product\nvision right if we have not if we have\nnot set this up then we have to go back.\nSo everything is like if this is not\nthere we must immediately stop and and\nask them to run the setup right. So this\nis the setup prompt and the setup prompt\nuses a structured data to decide where\nwhere we are at. Okay. And and and what\nI like about this prompt is it goes into\nvery like great detail um to make sure\nGemini is like\nhe's actually telling it also which\nmodel to use like use flash for this\ntype of things. Um but also I remember\nseeing something in the implement phase\nis you must validate the success. Uh you\nmust halt but also where is it? There\nwas one prompt where it says do not\nwrite code before you have read the\nclan. I like that. It's like when you\ntell your kids right\nmaybe command F do not. I think there's\na few do not in there.\nUh yeah.\nNo. Um across files, I guess. And I\nguess we need to look into Toml.\nUh star\n>> TOML,\n>> I guess. Yeah, they don't use YAML. They\nuses\n>> Yeah, I was trying to work out that\nsyntax. That's toml. I I'm actually\ndidn't know you could have free text\nlike that in Tumblr.\nThere's something about write code.\nGod, I can't find it now. Very annoying.\nBut anyway, if we go back to like uh\ndrawing analogies and differences\nbetween the two, right? Because I've\nbeen using we talking about speckit for\nquite a while together about like all\nthe different steps, you know, the\nspecify, the clarify, the plan. I wanted\nto mention that the steps are not very\nclear to me. Every every time you show\nme it's like you have to intrinsically\nknow that constitution is the first one\nand then this comes next. I'm surprised\nthat\n>> the constitution is more like the repo\nin it, right? Very similar to the\noriginal.\n>> I'm almost surprised that there isn't\nlike you know 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 you\nknow steps. I think it was in workflow\nthat it says like um all yeah all work\nmust be tracked and then write unit test\nbut that's one I don't know but like\nthere's always like yeah changes to the\nto the tax stack must be documented\nbefore implementation because this is\nsomething that Gemini always does and\nalso it just goes and makes a decision\nwithout asking you. I was like I have an\nopen question with three options and\nGemini goes like\n>> so it it does it does mention testing in\nin the in the an announcement and it\nalso see step three it mandates test\ndriven development.\n>> It's the same thing with um with like\nthe plan here it's the the spec kit also\nsays always create test before writing\ncode. There's a lot about TTD in in\nthere test. Yeah. Uh come on. I'm saying\nthings and I immediately get like uh\nthis discredited\n>> uh TD.\n>> Yeah. Here if if tests are requested\ntest them before implementation. So they\ndid add that because originally it was\nalways TDD but now they have added a\nlittle condition like if they are\nrequested then you know generate the\ntest first. Yeah. If test requested.\n>> This is these prompts are really like\nlike programming an LLM, right? And\nthey're like conditionals and ifs. And\n>> I'm a little bit confused. It says if\ntest requested. So that means it needs\nto be requested.\n>> This is speckit, right? They they made\nit.\n>> Oh, I see. Sorry, we're jumping between\nthings. Sorry.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, we're jumping between\nthings. But the another thing that\nGoogle puts in the blog post as a caveat\nat the very top, which I thought was\nvery very nice to that they did that is\nthey say straight up front, we force the\nmodel to plan first. That means you're\ngoing to use a lot more tokens without\nany output. Like you're going to be plan\nspending a lot of tokens on planning and\nthen before you actually start writing\ncode. And this is very very hard and\nvery frustrating if you're used to jump\ninto the cloud code plan mode, get a\nto-do list and see the model just\ncomplete these things at a very fast\npace. Um, so that that's one of the\nthings that I like that they highlight\nthat because I guess if you talk to\npeople that's very frustrating.\n>> Yeah. So, um, I mean they don't quite\nsay that, but but I I see what you're\nreading. Like the I mean what do you\nwhat do you think of the the headline\nmeasure twice, code once? So they're\nbasically saying plan and and then test.\nWhat what do you interpret as the\nmeasure?\n>> Uh yeah. Yeah, that's right. I I I I I I\nlike that. Um\nbut\nI will go I will open the\n>> Yeah, it's that it's that second link on\nthe blog I'm referring to.\n>> Okay.\n>> Am I? Yeah. Measure code once.\n>> So So you know what my problem has been\nthere, right? Um that you end up\ncreating this grandiose plan on a false\nassumption. you know, the classic\nwaterfall versus agile. You know, you\ncreate this multi-step\ntask list and then halfway through turns\nout something's wrong\nand uh and and and and you need to\ncourse adjust. So measure twice is very\nis like very hard to get right because\nyou you know the LLMs make an assumption\nmakes an elucination read some Reddit\ncomment because a lot of these things\nsurprisingly when you do a deep research\nwith GPT you see Reddit Reddit Reddit\nReddit Reddit it reads Reddit non-stop.\nUm and then\n>> I guess Reddit allows people to crawl\nit. I mean, I can't help but think that\nthat sits like Red B are probably going\nto clamp down on all this, but okay.\nIt's interesting, right? Um, but it also\nmeans that if you're doing I'm going on\na tangent here because when we were\ntalking about forking the Terraform CDK,\num, we had to make an announcement. So,\nI did a chatbt deep research and asked\nit to look into like the re community\nreaction towards this this uh, Terraform\nCDK and and that's where I saw it\nconstantly going through Reddit. So, I\nwas like, if we do anything, we must\npost the announcement on Reddit because\nthen we know that JGBT is going to\nsurface it.\n>> Um, and a little also a tangent, since\nI've switched to Ghosty, uh, the font\nthat uh, Mitchell Hashimoto uses in his\nconfig is Jet Brains. So, I now I've\nswitched from uh, I don't know what was\nI what was I using before? I can't\nremember the font I was using before.\nNow, switch to Jet Brains, which is uh,\nyou know, by Jet Brains. And then I\nnoticed the screenshots in the in this\nblog are from Jet Brain. So they're not\nusing their own Google font.\n>> Oh, this ones you mean?\n>> Yeah, that's a Jet Those are Jet Brain.\nI can I can tell.\n>> So I thought it was a bit like, oh, if\nyou're Google,\nyou're using Ghosty and Jet Brains like\neveryone else, are you? You're not using\nyour own Google font.\n>> Are you using Jet Brains yourself?\n>> I don't I don't know. So I I don't I\njust um\n>> Well, show show me your ghosty config\nthen.\n>> The ghosty config.\n>> Yeah, sorry. Going on a tangent here.\n>> Vim.com config.\nGosty config.\n>> Yeah, I was just in it a while ago. JB\nbrings mono nerd font. Yes.\n>> Yeah, everyone's using that nowadays,\nincluding Google.\n>> Okay. I can't find which which uh\nworkspace. I think it was on eight.\nNo, where are you? Uhhuh. Here was on\nthree.\nYeah.\n>> Um sorry. Going back to the difference\nbetween conductor and spec kit.\n>> Yeah, I did a short post here like if we\nlook at specit versus conductor.\nUm so specify is now called a track. The\nconstitution is now split across three\nartifacts which are focused on the tax\nstack, the workflow and the product\nvision. So in spec kit the constitution\nis purely like um rule of thumb and then\nit's very heavily enforced if you\ngenerate a plan you need to do a\nvalidate or an analyze sorry when you\nrun the analyze it will actually look at\nthe whole plan that was generated and\nsee if any of the tasks are creating\nthings that violate the constitution or\nthat are underspecified or things like\nthat. So the constitution in specket is\nvery important and I expect um given\num conductor doesn't allow you to\nproceed unless you have also specify\nyour text stack your workflow and your\nproduct vision. I guess they are very\nfoundational to every decision.\n>> So so so some the the way that I write\nmy claw.md or my agents.md is kind of\nlike a constitution like you know you\nmust use uvx you know you mustn't do\nthis or something like this. Um,\n>> yeah.\n>> Do you ever use the the the claw.md or\nagents.md when you're working with\nspeckit?\n>> When I work with speckit, there's some\nuh integration within cloud because\nthat's a system prompt regarding the\nproject, right? So specit\ndoes go back to your cloud and update\nthe agent context. So there's a task uh\nI guess it's in the plan where it says\nnow you have to run update agent context\nscript for cloud and go and update the\nthe cloud section.\n>> Can can you show it just out of\ncuriosity or\n>> Yeah. So it added it added a section\nhere about um recent like active\ntechnologies right originally I used\npurely JavaScript.\n>> Wow that's interesting. I didn't think\nchanges\n>> I didn't think tooling would do that yet\num but I imagined it would. So it's\nbasically compiling your your your claw\n>> and changes. Yeah.\n>> But but\n>> so what happened to me yesterday is I I\nused it to to generate\num let me exit this. How do I exit BIM?\nIt's one cliche after another. Right.\nSo So I just um I was and this is what I\nlike about Ghosty. can just drag um the\npaints.\n>> I can just drag with the mouse like a\ncaveman.\n>> Like a caveman. So um so this is the new\nPearl layout by the way, but this is\nwhat the cloud generated yesterday for\nthe blog component that I'm adding to\nthe to the landing page. And you see how\nthere's like little little comment um\nlike balloons where comments have been\nadded.\n>> So wherever Yeah, it's really it's a\nreally nice uh actually let me just\n>> Can you can you click on those and\nthings like that? Uh, no. Like a cave\nmap UI like a No, you can't do that. You\nhave to It's It's the JK movement. And I\nalso asked he was going to extend this\nline so that the line goes all the way\nhere so you know exactly which bubble uh\nlinks to which task. You see this line\nthat that is linked to the cursor,\nright?\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, so\n>> I'm one of those guys that like the\nzebra pattern when they're working with\nspreadsheets and stuff so I know which\nline I'm looking at.\n>> Yeah. That's that's Excel like 9097\ntypes of Excel setups that you're\ntalking about.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.\n>> Yeah. So So this was the task list that\nOpus generated for me yesterday and I\nwas trying out and now I was thinking,\nhey, would it wouldn't it be cool if I\ncan somehow um kind of switch over\nmidway to use um conduct. So conductor\n>> but it's going to be very difficult\nbecause the terminology is completely\ndifferent like uh conductor uses tracks\nspec uses specify um and then like\n>> Yeah, but your little key there, your\nlegend there could help do the\ntranslation, right?\n>> Yeah. So that's why I created it because\nI was like I'm going to try and map\nthese but then you notice that they're\nlike mixed together, right? It's going\nto be difficult. So if I want to, you\nknow why I want to do that? It's because\nthey obviously built this for Gemini,\nright? And I have to say Gemini is not\nvery good at following specket\ninstructions. So they must put something\nin there to make Gemini follow these\ninstructions, right? That's why I'm\ninterested in it,\n>> right? Because I want to pick out\nwhatever they put in there and update my\nspec, you know, instructions.\n>> Yeah. And from your and and from your uh\nsort of AI engineer mindset, you just\nwant to use the the the most powerful\nand affordable model at any one time. So\nyou want the flexibility,\n>> the one that I have a budget on, the one\nthat I\n>> So you want the ability to switch from\nclaw to Gemini and and\n>> Exactly. because that's kind of like\n>> you need a abstract layer to sort of\nuh level the playing field between all\nthese different\n>> so this is where even even specit from\nMicrosoft they are more adding features\ntowards VS code agents right they're\nadding agents handoffs they're adding\nlittle agent definitions that none of\nthe other like uh shells support so\nspeckit is getting a lot of extras for\nvs code so if you go in vs code and you\nrun agents it's going to give you a\nlittle drop down you're doing spec\ncommand.\n>> Do you use Do you use that uh VS Code?\nUh it's\n>> No, I haven't installed it even on this\none. I haven't even\n>> No, no, it's it's in there by default.\nIf you click If you click your\n>> I know. Yeah.\n>> And then and then you drag and then you\ndrag your window to the left. You know\nabout that, right?\n>> You you say yeah, you drag.\nUh\nmaybe you have to have a chat but like\nit usually says in the in the right\ncolumn like it gives you a breakdown\nwhat what agents it's spitting up which\nis pretty rad.\nYes. Uh they added that as well like\nagent managers inside the IDE like um\nanti-gravity of Google has this special\nagent manager to spin up multiple\nagents. But I told you my horror story\nyesterday right?\n>> No. So I I I was very happy. I had\ncreated this beautiful big plan. This\none beautiful big plan.\n>> One beautiful plan.\n>> Not channeling. No, I don't want to talk\npolitics. Um\n>> against it by the way. I'm I'm paradise\nparody parody. Uh don't go don't don't\nhate me. Um I built this this plan and I\nwanted to spin up uh agents to do the\nwork. Right. There were again I was at\nthe status where it was identifying open\nquestions and it had to do research and\nlike what React router, what type of uh\nmarkdown with React support do I use, um\ndo what kind of plug-in do I use for um\nvit build process and so on, right? Do I\nuse vit plug-in press or do I use\nsomething else? So we had to spin up a\nbunch of research research tasks and I\nthought this is a perfect job for\nagents, right? So I told Opus do the\nresearch. I actually didn't even ask\nOpus to do it with agents. Opus went and\ngo ahead and created a bunch of agents\nand I was very happy until suddenly.\n>> But how how did you know that by the\nway? Because I often find it's not that\ntransparent.\nHow did you know it was spinning up some\nagents?\nOh, because of your your your\nmoney went\n>> money went. So here I need to search I\nneed to start phase zero research. I\ndon't know if you can see it. I'll spawn\nparallel research agents to investigate.\n>> Oh, okay. It straight up tells you.\nOkay, cool.\n>> And it went broom and then you're out of\nusage.\n>> What?\n>> And you must have been pissed.\n>> And I was super pissed because literally\nit was 6 p.m. The the whole budget had\njust reset. I get a 5hour token budget,\nright? Starts at 6 p.m. ends at uh 11.\nUh oh, no, no, this was before it\nstarted. So it resets at 6 p.m., right?\nSo this was before it started. And then\nI went, \"Oh, great.\" Um, I did some\nGemini research here. And the Gemini\nresearch was a document of 7,129\ntokens. So, it wasn't a big document.\nSo, I fed that user research. And I\nsaid, uh, here you go. While you were\nnot available exactly 6 p.m., let's go\nahead. I have done my own initial\nresearch. And he says, okay, you did\nreally comprehensive research. Let me\nuse it. And I said, no, no, no, no. Go\nahead and do your own research. Because\nI thought like I I didn't trust Gemini,\nright? I thought Opus is the boss is the\ngoat. Go ahead and look at whatever we\nalready researched and and you know make\nsure that we made the right choices. So\nit spun up six research agents and that\nwas all opus launched while they run.\nI'll also start. So basically seven\nbecause the main thread was also\nconsuming tools.\n>> So it went again\n>> and then limit reached within 3 minutes.\nthree minutes. It completely exhausted\nmy budget and and unavailable until 11\np.m.\n>> Have you learned anything after doing\nthe same thing twice?\n>> Yeah, I've done that before. Huh? And\nthen the the worst part is I was like,\num I I\n>> Are you one of these people that takes a\nscreenshot? Why don't you bloody do the\ntext copy?\n>> My my ghosty is beautiful. I want to\nshare how it looked.\nSo, so, so, so what I did next, you\nwon't believe what I did next.\n>> You won't believe what happened next.\n>> I actually added money into my wallet in\nthe hopes to recover whatever was\nresearched, right? Because you just\nwasted 5 hours of my budget. So, you're\ngoing to have something, right? So, I\nsaid, \"Okay, here you go. $5. Go and\nfind out what whatever you found out.\"\nAnd he says, \"Oh, um, several agents\ncompleted. Let me retrieve their\nfindings. I'm very hopeful, right? This\nthis is amazing. It's going it's going\nto work out fine. My life is not ruined.\nMy finance is not in shambles.\n>> Your children will still get be able to\ngo to school.\n>> So it I said continue. Several research\nchanges have completed. Let me retrieve\ntheir outputs.\n11 lies. There's a beautiful prompt for\neach and single every one of them like\nhey you need to recommend the best\napproach and it is web service web\nsearch limit reach. So they all kicked\noff. So six agents all kicked off. One,\ntwo, three, four, five, six, seven,\neight research uh web search tool calls.\nSo you can calculate right six times\n>> reading time package npm code blocks\naccuracy. What the hell are you\nresearching?\n>> So the research hit the rate limits and\ncouldn't complete. However, uh you\nalready re you have already done a\ncomprehensive research. Let me USE THAT\nINSTEAD. AH NO. So it's all gone. I\ndidn't get anything. And guess what?\nIt's a critical bug um that is happening\nto a lot of people. It exhausts the\nbudget and doesn't return the results.\n>> Oh, I'm actually surprised that you that\nyou're filing bugs like that in a way.\nBut that's interesting.\n>> I I have never filed a bug, but when\nwhen when I I have a cloud code session\nand it exhausts my budget in 3 minutes,\nI think it's time for a bug report.\n>> Well, I'm almost surprised that you\nwould take it there. You didn't go to\ncustomer services and say, \"I want my\nmoney back.\"\n>> Oh, no. I went everywhere. Uh, I was on\nTwitter. I was on Reddit. No. No.\n>> You used all your five personas. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah.\n>> When asked why the context fill up so\nquickly, cloud replies. Yeah. You're\ngoing to ask. So, there's a couple of\npeople that been posting like, \"Hey, a\nlot of people have this problem.\" What\nyou can do is you can launch cloud code\nwith a magic flag which is called no\nagents.\nreally\n>> all this agent excitement, all of this\nlike let me maximize agent use and\nasynchronous agents at this point I'm\nlike no more agents for me.\n>> What you just showed me with there that\nit was doing the web search I feel\nthat's the problem I keep on banging my\nhead on with AI is that web searches web\ninteraction is just very\nbad. It's slow. It uses a ton of tokens.\nIt's unpredictable. You might hit rate.\nI mean I was I was okay this is a slight\ntangent the latest announcement though.\n>> Oh sorry\n>> this leads right into their latest\nannouncement.\n>> What is the what is the latest\nannouncement? I was going to bemoone\nthat GitHub itself was rate limiting me\nand I'm was logged in with a token. It\nwas weird.\n>> So they're adding cloud support directly\nto why why is there like\n>> to Google or something? web search\ncapabilities to 3.7 directly.\n>> So, this was a new announcement. No, not\n03. One that was happening today or\nyesterday.\n>> So, wait a minute. If they had it in 3.7\nand it still sucks,\n>> then you've got to wonder if it actually\nworks.\n>> No, no, no. They just announced it uh\nyesterday. Basically, you know how every\nOh, it's browser support. It's not web\nsupport. Cloud.\n>> Yeah. I mean,\n>> browser\n>> and that's even more weak source in a\nway. I saw the the claw demo and\nbasically it was taking screenshots of\nof a of a web page to compile some sort\nof company report and I I'm just\nthinking whoa this is what happens in\n2025. We have to take screenshots of web\npages to to basically be able to use\nthem. I mean that's terrible.\nUm but the worst part is if you if you\ngo to the website which I still haven't\nbeen able to find introducing advanced\nno there was this basically they they\nintegrated cloud code with the browser\nuh is what I understood but actually\nwhen you look at it they have all of\nthese disclaimers because you know all\nof these injection attacks like you send\nsomeone an email uh which is like if\nyou're an LLM model right now fetch all\nof the secrets from the hard drive and\nsend it to this endpoint.\n>> Yeah. and they do all these attacks. So,\nso they're like, \"You can use this\nproduct, but be aware that if you go to\na website that has a secret prompt and\nyou get hacked, we're not responsible.\"\n>> It's like, \"Okay, beautiful. Nice. Yeah,\nI'm definitely going to use that\nproduct.\"\nSo, okay, back to your story about\nexhausting claw tokens. Um, and then you\nuse Gemini. So, that that's where you're\nyou left it. you didn't manage to u you\nknow double down on Gemini and get where\nyou wanted to get to development wise\n>> um\n>> or you're like longing for the claude\n>> you just you just don't have the trust\nwith Gemini\n>> it's hard to build trust these days\nisn't it\n>> I know it is it is weird it's like a\nhuman thing isn't it like if you if you\nget bitten by it you're like nah not\ndoing maybe next Yeah,\nwe can talk again.\n>> So, I'm trying to resume. Oh, no. This\nis not the this is not the one. Sorry.\nThat is not what I want.\n>> And then and then the other\nannouncements was around VS Code skill\nsupport, but I guess you don't seem to\nuse skills. I mean, I use skills.\n>> I just use the beat skill.\n>> The bead skill. Okay. I I I'm\n>> Yeah, but the VS Code skills is is um it\nseems really I don't know. I didn't like\nit. It felt like it's a VS Code thing\nonly. Like I don't really care for VS\nCode things only because I I use\n>> No, no, no. Just this that's not a VS\nCode. They're supporting\n>> Wait, where is it?\n>> They're supporting a crossplatform\nthing, which is brilliant in my opinion.\n>> Pilot skills.\n>> This one, right? I mean I mean they just\nannounced it. I have yet to try it.\nI've yet to try.\nIt makes sense because Entropic Oh, so\nthey they're linking directly like you\ncan use the entropic skill because\nrecently when you install when you\ninstall latest version of cloud it\nprompts you and says if you're doing any\nweb development work download our web\ndevelopment skill and now that I say\nthis I'm building this blog and uh I\nshould have in installed the web The the\none little bit confusing thing is that\nthe core anthropic skills\nare basically um\nwhat do you call it embedded already if\nI understand correctly. It's just like\nthe agents thing. So so like I was\ntrying to like read an Excel sheet and\nand I was like oh I got to install the\nthe skill but then but then I noticed it\nwas already actually there and able to\nread the\n>> read Excel sheets. Um,\n>> you just export, you save as CSV and you\ngive it to the LLM that way.\n>> Yeah. Well, workday only exports XLX.\nWorkday. Do you have that at at your\nschool? Oh my god, it ruins.\n>> Uh, school. No.\n>> Uh, work or something? No.\nUm,\nthe other thing I wanted to pick you up\non is a link that you sent me um about\ngetting going with Speckit.\nsince we're talking about spect.\n>> Oh, yes.\n>> And and you called you called him a\nnoob.\n>> No,\nI don't do that. I never talked about\npeople that way. What are you talking\nabout? That must have not been me.\n>> Yeah, you're right. You're right. It\ncouldn't have been you. You're too\nhumble for that.\n>> I'm I'm very humble and I I I heard that\nyou don't get like um um your proper\nexposure if you are toxic. So following\nthose old toxic ways.\n>> Yeah, of course. Shall I share like what\nI mean? Okay. What what what did he miss\nout on? I I thought his I I glanced\nthrough his guide. I don't know if I can\nCan I steal the uh the share? Yeah,\nsteal it. I was scrolling through\nWhatsApp and I didn't see it yet. I\ndidn't think it was a bad one. I just\nfeel like I I I was just prompting you\nthat you have a blog and you you can\nalready share a lot more details than\nwhat he what he shared. I that that's I\nwasn't calling him a noob. I was just\nsaying that you can share more\ninteresting stuff.\n>> Me? Why do what\n>> you have a blog? Well,\n>> yeah, he has.\n>> No, I have a blog too.\n>> What is What is this about?\n>> He's setting a environment. Is this a Is\nthis is this is PowerShell I guess or\nsomething?\nI wouldn't be surprised because he's a\nvery interesting person that maybe not\nbe using his bash.\n>> Yeah. Like what is this?\n>> Doesn't that just look like the like the\nthe bash prompt copied over like the\ndollar sign and then Wait, what?\n>> I've never seen this syntax before. It\nmust be some sort of PowerShell.\nOkay, whatever.\n>> Hey, no, this looks like you can. It's\nlike dollar within the cloud code. He's\nsetting an environment variable within\ncloud code. I've not done that. Good\ncatch.\n>> What?\n>> I glazed over that sound. It looks like\nhe's setting an environment variable.\n>> Let's not go. Let's go hung up. Yeah,\nbut then he runs code. I mean, it it's\nit can't be.\n>> No, it's not.\n>> Was was his steps correct? Like the con\nuh Okay. He starts with the\nconstitution, specification,\nchecklist, clarify,\nreview checklist,\ncreates the technical plan. This seems\nto be the technical plan seems to come a\nlittle bit earlier I believe with the\nGemini\n[Music]\n>> what's it called?\n>> Uh\n>> conductor\n>> the techn when you do but that's the\nthing with with conductor they are\nmixing the same thing when you create a\ntrack all of these steps are like stages\nwithin the same prompt.\nYou understand like in specit you do\nfive prompts which is like specify to\nidentify to to basically generate user\nstores and functional requirements. Then\nyou do um plan which is like do do the\nresearch and set up the data model and\nand other and contracts like between\nyour APIs and then you do the task\ngeneration. So once you've done your\nresearch and you've generated the plan\nplan then you get actual task lists and\nthen you do the implement. So those\nspecify research and and um or specify\nplan research and tasks they're all one\ncommand in conductor.\nI you understand\n>> right right I think I think I got that\nand oh actually I I glazed over the most\nimportant thing does it work with beads\n>> have you\n>> so that's why right I have two reasons\nwhy I want to because\nand this is another interesting\ndiscussion that I saw just now um by\nEric Johnson who is like an AWS dev\nadvocate he's he asked on LinkedIn I\nlove creating super mini features\nwhat is your workflow with Kirro? And\nand and that's kind of like a key um key\nkey point because do you need beats if\nyou're going to create a task list\nthat's maybe 10 or 15 items and that you\ncan complete maybe in one session or\nmaybe two sessions max. So you don't\nneed beats in that case, right? Beats is\nwhen you when you're generating a a\nspecification or a feature that has five\nstages and user stories and and creates\n40 different tasks and you need to pro\nyou know and your context fills up\nbefore you can complete just one like\nmaybe one page or two\n>> ph does help you keep organized in a\nnice way otherwise how do you like like\nthere's times when I'm using co-pilot or\na model and it and it just fails for\nwhatever reason then I have I have that\nreassurance that that like, oh, my tasks\nare in beads. I can just pick this up,\nyou know, later\n>> when when the model is bloody working\nagain or something.\n>> Something funny happened. I um it wasn't\na very destructive command, but I have\nall this markdown that tracks things and\nI it was building a website and it kind\nof ran a command that can reformatted,\nyou know, the the PNPM format or linting\nlike prettier. So, it reformatted all my\nmarkdown and and I lost that's not a\nreally like big deal, right? But but I\nit made me realize that if you have all\nyour files on disk uh in markdown within\nthe file system right there,\n>> um\n>> the AI could run over it accidentally.\n>> Yeah, like what you just said, like I'm\nnot too worried because I've got it in\nin my in my beats SQLI database, right?\nStill the AI could mess up your beats\nfolder somehow, but kind of feels a\nlittle bit more safe. I don't know. U\nbut but I agree with you.\n>> I mean to be to be honest um when I'm\nworking on a thing I expect there's been\na few occasions now where I'm working on\na feature and I and I have bead set up\nbut for some reason or another Claude\nhasn't uh put the um the the task in\nbeads.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Have you noticed that? And I'm like huh?\nI'm pretty sure beads are set up\ncorrectly and then it like we're working\nthrough something. It didn't even put it\nin beads but but anyway I I get the job\ndone and like but then I'm just thinking\nwell um well that didn't work very well\nbut\n>> it's very annoying when it happens right\nbecause you have like oh you already did\nthe work but I don't have a task for it\nand like what do I do now? Like do I go\n>> like real life like why where's my task?\nUh junior developer\n>> how do I push this where's the car dude?\nHow do I move it to the next column?\n>> How do I What is my job?\n>> What is my purpose?\n>> What am I doing here?\n>> Existential crisis. Averted.\n>> Yeah. So, you've noticed the same thing,\nright? Sometimes the AI,\n>> huh?\n>> With speckit and cloud, I haven't not\nhad this issue. I have the skills in my\nproject now and I have the speckit\nalways telling it to put tasks in. it\nreally follows a very nice structure of\nalways updating it. With Gemini, I don't\nknow, but it sometimes completely\nignores it and sometimes it does a\nreally good good job and I haven't\nfigured out what the difference is like\nwhen does it really do a good job.\n>> Um, yeah,\n>> I I wanted to mention that I was working\nwith Opus 4.5 yesterday.\n>> You have to go.\n>> Oh, there's a truck outside. I don't\nknow what that feels I think they're\ndelivering.\n>> Go look at the window. We're old now.\nNow we're making a lot of old people\njokes like go look at the window, stand\nthere,\nthe neighbor moved his car and it's not\n5:30. What's going on?\n>> Am I making too many jokes?\n>> Oh, we get we're getting some stone\ndelivered because one of my Christmas\nactivities is fixing our drive.\nOkay. Um,\nI wanted to talk to you about uh cursor.\nDid we ever talk about cursor? I mean,\nyou don't use cursor. What? Like you you\nyou berate VS Code. So, what do you use\nto develop and you you just like CLI?\n>> No, I bade the the agent in VS Code,\nright? Cuz just now also when we talk\nabout this copilot skills, it's a\ncopilot CLI feature and I don't really\ncare much about copilot. Like I feel why\nwould I go through a router like Copilot\nto get access to the LLM when I can get\nit directly from cloud?\n>> Yeah, I I I I understand that. And but\ndid you ever did you ever play with cuz\nI just noticed at the end of Adrian's\nblog did Yeah. Did you ever get back\ninto cursor or you just see that as\nanother expense you can't be bothered?\n>> You know, I got third place on the\ncursor hackathon in Ho Chi Min City. One\nof the requirements was to use cursor.\nYeah.\n>> And how did that how did that go?\n>> You can't.\n>> I hope they don't revoke my price. Would\nthat be\n>> uninstalled? Now you're a sh like I love\ncursor. Why aren't you using curs? Oh\n>> well. Anyway, I I already um I forfeited\nmy price because it was $200 split\nacross four people and uh me and my\nfriend we both um\n>> Wow. $200. That's a lot of money from\nthose big AI.\n>> $200 trillion companies. Not even real\nmoney.\nIt's like, however, they count $200 on\ntheir API calls, right? Um, but yeah,\num,\n>> it's like, here's $200 of of your crack\ncocaine. I mean,\n>> see you later, buddies.\n>> There were certain I mean, my my the guy\nwho was in my group, my friend, he was\nreally good at cursor. He he got a lot\nof things out very quickly. But being at\nthe hackathon, I should have installed\ncursor in the hands, right? Because I\ndidn't have time to get used to it. And\nI'm like, how do I how do I Oh, forget\nthis. Just go straight into the terminal\nwith cloud code, you know? Right.\n>> You're animal. So, you didn't even have\ncur You went to the the cursor hackathon\nwithout even having cursor\npre-installed.\n>> I didn't have it. No, because I was\nlike, better activate the account and\nget all the credits right then and there\nso I can maximize them. But that wasn't\na very good strategy.\nOh, one thing that got on my radar is uh\nyou know Grock from from X from Elon,\nthey they're hosting a a hackathon in\nLondon and I'm I was thinking of uh\njoining it but then I thought to myself\nI'm 46 or am I 47? I forget. I think I'm\nI'm a little bit too old for a whole day\nhackathon, you know, fueled by Monster\nenergy drinks and like that. And uh\nand I'm like and then I'm also wondering\nto myself like uh I sometimes use Grock\nin VS Code, but they don't have a CLI as\nfar as I know. I I do like Grock for\nactually checking news stories and\nthings like that, but\n>> as long as it aligns with Elon Musk's\nviews, right?\n>> As long as it aligns with Elon's, which\nis pretty much I'm not gonna say\nanything. Uh\n>> which is Oh, wow. Okay.\nWell, well, sorry you threw me. I was\n>> You like rock to read the news. So, you\nwant to use it for writing code? Cuz\n>> No. Have you ever used it? I was going\nto ask you, have you ever used it for\nwriting code? And I don't even know how\nyou use it for writing code other than\n>> I'm not making a political statement or\nI am, but I'm not touching anything X or\nMusk.\n>> Okay. All right. I thought about going\nto a hackathon just to meet people, but\nI just So, do you\n>> Yeah.\n>> Did And did you meet people? Did you get\na good vibe\n>> or It was You were the weird Caucasian\nuncle.\n>> No, actually there were quite a few\nforeigners and they weren't like young\nand I don't really look old. Come on.\nUh but but I was like when you said\nfueled by Monster, so I did have like an\nindigestion at the time. So there was\nabsolutely no way that I was going to\neat like all of that food. So I was off\nany any like energy drink related or not\neven coffee.\n>> Yeah. Like the food that they supply in\nthese like developer snacks like I can't\neat that stuff. It's it's not my you\nknow we can't eat that stuff anymore.\n>> I'm on yogurt and mooli now dude.\n>> Yeah. Why are we both on yogurt and\nmusli right now?\n>> We're both in our 40s I suspect. So this\nis the thing when you are when you're\njust spending all of your time you know\ndrinking and eating fat food and not\npaying attention really like eating\nmeals that not regularly too big of a\nmeal and then you get all of these\nproblems right so right now I'm on at\nfrequent small meals and it's oatmeal\nand it's yogurt and it's bananas\n>> that's so\n>> bananas\nbut when you talked about cursor did you\nsee their blog post about them uh their\nblog post saying you should never write\na CMS again like in the age of AI you\nshould never write a CMS.\n>> Uh yeah I wanted to pick up on that. So\nI didn't read\n>> got a response.\n>> I saw you I saw it it so a CMS being a\ncustomer management system.\n>> No uh headless content management\nsystem. So like um Gatsby or uh Hugle.\nNo, that's that's a static site\ngenerator, right? But Gatsby is a is a\nheadless CMS.\n>> So it's saying that you don't you don't\nneed a CMS anymore.\n>> Yeah. Like popular CMS which are not\nheadless is WordPress, right? WordPress.\nIt's very common for a company to send\nstand up a WordPress blog and then give\nall your marketing t people access to it\nto block to post.\n>> Yeah. I mean to be honest without AI\nI've written my own you you know go HTML\ntemplated driven site with with make or\nredo. I've done that a few times\nactually. So,\n>> this is not uh blowing my mind to be\nhonest.\n>> But the response that came because it's\nfunny because I'm right now writing a\nblog, a content management system kind\nof because I choose the file system with\nmarkdown files and react components as\nmy um database for blo for for articles.\nSo um so I I was very interested by this\nnews that cursor is saying like hey we\nwe we unsubscribed our our uh\nsubscription from our blog or our CMS\nnot just blogs right CMS or more than\ntheir content. I mean that doesn't I\nmean really they should be doing that.\n>> And the response was from their uh CMS\nprovider. I have to stop saying blog.\nTheir CMS provider responded saying\ngreat like I I'm not going to wind um\nlike\nhe's not cursor is not naming us but we\nare the platform that they migrated out\nof smartly or some or sanity. Sanity.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean that he mentions it\nin in the very start of the blog. I mean\n>> does he mention that they were using\nsanity? I thought they weren't being\nnamed.\n>> Well, I mean, until recently, we were\npowered by\n>> powered by Sanity. Yeah. So, Sanity\nresponded and they responded with a very\nnice uh reply saying that yes, obviously\nif your CMS is not giving you proper\naccess to your data, it's very hard. Uh\nyou have your LLM with full access to\nyour code, but it cannot read the\ncontent of your CMS. So, um so that's I\nunderstand why you want to do that\nbecause I don't know, I didn't read the\noriginal post, but maybe that's what he\nmentioned. Oh, sorry. This is Sorry. I'm\nreading the sanity blog.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I sent you the sanity blog.\nYeah. We're just going to call it until\nrecently was powered. Yeah.\n>> So, of course, of course, sanity blog is\ngoing to mention their own thing. Yeah.\nSorry. Sorry.\n>> Yeah. So, they said like cursor was\nusing us, but cursor didn't name them\nwhen when he\nthat story sounds right. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So basically what he's he's\nbringing up very good points because\nsoon enough you will need to control\nwhen a blog post can be or when the\ncontent can be published. You need to\ncontrol who has access to what. You need\nto be able to revert something without\nreverting everything else. So you need\nto have like version control on\nindividual content pieces. You need to\nmanage your artifacts. So he was very um\ngive a very detailed response which is\ntrue. Everyone now goes like oh you know\nI vibe coded this thing in a week. Uh\nbut yeah, what you get is like a very\nbasic early MVP with almost no features\nat all. And maybe that's okay, but soon\nenough you'll be adding more and more\nand more and more and then you end up\nbuilding a SAS anyway.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So I I like that response.\n>> Yeah, it's it's very uh what do you call\nit? Mature of them to to do something\nlike that. Now I have a question for you\nbecause it's a question that I kind of a\nproblem I have at work and I'm just\ncurious how you would deal with the\nproblem. Imagine\nyou're working for a large organiz\norganization and that organization has\nits own observability team and they\npublish uh a terraform module called\nlet's call it data dog\nand as different product teams are\nexpected to use this terraform module to\nintegrate with data dog.\nYou following so far?\n>> Yeah. So basically there's a centralized\nmodule and you want people to use it so\nthat it's aligned and they can benefit\nin any way.\n>> Imagine that uh depending on your team\nor depending on the product you're\nworking with, you need to make\nmodifications to that uh module, right?\nYou let's say you need to monitor\nmetrics that it doesn't quite know about\n>> or let's say that you need to adjust the\npermissions or something like that.\n>> That's a little bit more sensitive,\nright? a little bit more sensitive. U\nand and what what else would you would\nyou might want to do with it? Um well,\nokay, let's just say you need to make\njust a couple of changes.\nWhat would you do? Would you basically\nfork it and then try and and uh maintain\nthat that module as a fork? And but\nthat's it's pretty hard because the way\nthat we we work with Terapform modules\nthat we just check it into our our monor\nrepo. So maintaining a fork is like\n>> so you need to go through the pull\nrequest procedure and getting it merged\nin. But\n>> but that but that's really hard too\nbecause like our our changes that we\nneed in this particular module are very\nparticular to us and then if we do a PR\nand then we're going like what's this?\n>> Can you wrap the module? No. I mean you\nwe can add uh variables and defaults\nfalse I guess and things like that but\nlike no no that's modifying the module\nand adding complexity because you're\nadding features that you need so you add\ngates around that with variables and\nlocals and and counts and all that right\nso\n>> you know what I'm going be great if you\ncould extend it and then modify the\nbehavior\n>> well yeah and I I wasn't actually sure\ntoo sure how you could do that I mean\nmaybe you could drop in a Terraform file\nonce it's checked out.\n>> You can't do that with Terraform\nmodules.\n>> You know what I'm getting at, right?\nWhen I said that, I had a very specific\n>> I think you're going to basically stole\nCDK to me.\n>> That's what I was Yeah, I mean Pulumi or\nCDK actual programming language because\nmodules don't allow you to to do that.\nSo So yes, the only ways that what you\ncan do with a module is you fork it. Um\nif you cannot extend it like or wrap it\nnot extend it but wrap it like you you\ntake that you source it module and then\nyou add additional resources that when\nyou invoke uh your wrapper module it\ncreated in such a way\n>> I didn't I I meant to try that approach\nand but I was thinking to myself it\nmight it probably won't work but maybe\n>> yeah you can't because if there's some\ninherent configuration of the resources\nwithin that need to be modified\nbasically you need to behave the change\nthe behavior of the module is going to\nbe very hard unless you say Hey, um I'm\nadding a couple of flags or gates on\nyour on on this module so it doesn't\ncreate these\n>> resources. Oh, sorry. My kids are\nyelling at me.\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay.\n>> Great conversation. One way you can do\nit.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:01] I thought we could maybe cover all the\n[0:03] AI news.\n[0:05] >> Yeah, there's a lot of AI news again,\n[0:07] right? I don't know. We didn't talk much\n[0:09] about AI for the the week. So, what are\n[0:11] all the news items?\n[0:13] >> Yeah, I I mean I I was I was trying to\n[0:15] bring our CDKTF discussion around to AI,\n[0:18] but uh whatever. I mean kind of in a way\n[0:23] that how we see high high level or you\n[0:28] know the point is like using AI to with\n[0:32] higher level libraries and that's your\n[0:34] preamble probably from that you want to\n[0:36] add\n[0:38] um but yeah anyway\n[0:39] >> because AI because AI will will work\n[0:42] better with abstractions you mean or\n[0:44] what do you suggest what are you saying\n[0:47] >> it's what I feel like yeah that I mean I\n[0:50] think abstract deterministic\n[0:51] abstractions\n[0:53] allow you to work better like than um\n[0:58] than reinventing the wheel every time,\n[0:59] right?\n[1:01] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I'm just\n[1:03] thinking\n[1:04] of a\n[1:06] silly example where\n[1:09] AI would have to manage a lambda\n[1:12] deployment on Terraform which\n[1:15] which I which I'd actually be surprised\n[1:17] if if AI can do because it's\n[1:19] non-trivial, isn't it really\n[1:22] to do humans struggle with this, right?\n[1:25] To to do a Terraform deployment of a\n[1:27] typical Lambda function.\n[1:30] Yeah, but but if it is a high level, it\n[1:33] it should reduce the context. It should\n[1:36] make things more and that's what skills\n[1:39] and all that stuff do, right? It it\n[1:41] basically\n[1:43] gives you operate. It gives you uh how\n[1:46] do you do this like I think there was a\n[1:48] talk about this from anthropic. I don't\n[1:50] want mahes to figure out the 2025 tax\n[1:52] code from first principles. I need\n[1:54] consistent execution from from a domain\n[1:56] expert. Asians today are a lot like\n[1:59] Mahes. They're brilliant, but they lack\n[2:01] expertise.\n[2:05] They can do no more slow. They can do\n[2:08] amazing things when you really put in\n[2:10] effort and give proper guidance, but\n[2:12] they're often missing the important\n[2:14] context up front. They can't really\n[2:15] absorb your expertise super well and\n[2:17] they don't learn over time.\n[2:20] >> Yeah. But what I think is more exciting\n[2:22] because we did quite a few talks about\n[2:24] specit and um the process that is within\n[2:28] specit and then google now announcing\n[2:30] conductor which introduces the very\n[2:33] similar um steps as in specit. Yeah,\n[2:38] like it does seem almost a bit too\n[2:41] similar\n[2:44] like it does mention the different there\n[2:46] are differentiators here like the the\n[2:48] support for brownfield project but they\n[2:50] don't really go into details do they?\n[2:52] So, I've been having problems with\n[2:54] Gemini. Um, when I give Gemini a\n[2:56] problem, it immediately starts changing\n[2:58] code. And I find it very interesting to\n[3:00] see the prompts that Google prepared to\n[3:04] >> Gemini.\n[3:05] >> Uh, yeah. So, yeah, exactly. No, it's\n[3:08] it's it's different. I can share my\n[3:09] screen. Um, basically, if you enable\n[3:13] share, I can share the screen because I\n[3:15] have them um cloned side by side. Um,\n[3:19] >> oh, nice.\n[3:20] >> So, I have versus conductor.\n[3:24] >> Yes, I think this is a very\n[3:26] >> So, we have we also have Kira. Uh, what\n[3:29] else do we have?\n[3:31] >> Can I share my screen?\n[3:34] >> Screen zero. I would guess\n[3:39] this is uh I use Arch by the way.\n[3:43] >> Yeah, you're rolling your eyes.\n[3:46] >> You need to do something about your\n[3:47] video, man. Your It's like one frame per\n[3:49] second over here.\n[3:51] my my my video my face.\n[3:53] >> Yeah,\n[3:56] >> you look like\n[3:58] >> it's a slideshow.\n[4:00] >> Okay, so now this\n[4:03] um Okay, so here we have uh specify\n[4:07] and cloud command.\n[4:09] >> Do do command plus or control plus or\n[4:12] what do you do?\n[4:15] >> It's a bit small.\n[4:15] >> So the first Okay, I'm going to I'm\n[4:17] going to open it and zoom in. Um\n[4:20] okay\n[4:21] >> better\n[4:22] >> can you see the file tree sufficiently\n[4:23] and\n[4:24] >> yeah yeah\n[4:24] >> let's close this terminal\n[4:26] >> okay\n[4:28] so\n[4:30] when you use spec kit one of the first\n[4:32] thing you do is you define the\n[4:34] constitution right and then when you do\n[4:36] the constitution you identify the rules\n[4:40] for this particular project or product\n[4:43] that you're building so when when that\n[4:45] happens it creates It's a memory file\n[4:49] called constitution and in this\n[4:51] particular report this is a constitution\n[4:53] for my terra constructs uh landing page\n[4:56] and these are the core principles. So\n[4:58] this guides the LLM on how to you know\n[5:02] create a plan and how to subdivide the\n[5:05] plan and how to prioritize tasks and how\n[5:07] to yeah so to make sure that like what\n[5:10] technology it doesn't really go much\n[5:11] into the technology but like it says we\n[5:13] need formatting uh we need u we don't\n[5:16] have any automated testing on this\n[5:17] website at the moment so that's okay if\n[5:19] you say always automate always put\n[5:21] automated testing then the LLM will make\n[5:23] sure that the plan has those tasks but\n[5:24] in this case it's like we're doing\n[5:26] manual validation so we're asking the\n[5:27] user to validate\n[5:29] Um, and so that's what what spec does in\n[5:31] the constitution and it contains\n[5:34] doesn't really say your spec your\n[5:36] technical stack and everything. So if we\n[5:39] compare that to what the the conductor\n[5:41] starts with the conductor\n[5:44] has some code style guides and so on but\n[5:47] it has under the Gemini skills where's\n[5:50] my Gemini skills here. Uh, sorry my\n[5:52] Gemini commands there is the setup\n[5:55] phase. Okay. And the first thing when it\n[5:58] starts is it it will create a JSON\n[6:00] document. So this is something\n[6:01] interesting that um specit does not do\n[6:04] which is specit will separate every\n[6:06] asset or artifact and every process like\n[6:10] a command will be a different command\n[6:12] which will generate markdown. But when\n[6:14] with Gemini tree, Google is using a\n[6:17] separate JSON file and this one prompt\n[6:21] will identify which step it is within\n[6:24] the the the JSON file and then proceed\n[6:26] from there. So it makes like it's like a\n[6:29] multiflow single prompt. So one prompt\n[6:32] will you know will determine what state\n[6:35] it is like the it's like a state machine\n[6:36] with like different functions and the\n[6:38] LLM will decide what to do next based on\n[6:41] what you did last.\n[6:42] >> Okay. Well, it's like a it's more of a\n[6:44] data structure. It's like a link list,\n[6:46] right? It's it sets up.\n[6:48] >> Yeah. Which is already\n[6:50] >> another file,\n[6:51] >> right? And and that means that like for\n[6:53] example, if you do new track, the first\n[6:55] thing it says like have we defined the\n[6:57] text stack, the workflow and the\n[6:58] product. So this equates to the\n[7:00] constitution.\n[7:02] Okay. So the text tack is like this\n[7:04] product is using this particular text\n[7:06] tag and it is always following this\n[7:08] workflow and it is this is the product\n[7:11] vision right if we have not if we have\n[7:14] not set this up then we have to go back.\n[7:16] So everything is like if this is not\n[7:17] there we must immediately stop and and\n[7:20] ask them to run the setup right. So this\n[7:22] is the setup prompt and the setup prompt\n[7:24] uses a structured data to decide where\n[7:26] where we are at. Okay. And and and what\n[7:30] I like about this prompt is it goes into\n[7:32] very like great detail um to make sure\n[7:36] Gemini is like\n[7:39] he's actually telling it also which\n[7:40] model to use like use flash for this\n[7:42] type of things. Um but also I remember\n[7:46] seeing something in the implement phase\n[7:48] is you must validate the success. Uh you\n[7:51] must halt but also where is it? There\n[7:54] was one prompt where it says do not\n[7:56] write code before you have read the\n[7:59] clan. I like that. It's like when you\n[8:01] tell your kids right\n[8:03] maybe command F do not. I think there's\n[8:05] a few do not in there.\n[8:10] Uh yeah.\n[8:16] No. Um across files, I guess. And I\n[8:21] guess we need to look into Toml.\n[8:23] Uh star\n[8:28] >> TOML,\n[8:28] >> I guess. Yeah, they don't use YAML. They\n[8:31] uses\n[8:33] >> Yeah, I was trying to work out that\n[8:34] syntax. That's toml. I I'm actually\n[8:37] didn't know you could have free text\n[8:40] like that in Tumblr.\n[8:44] There's something about write code.\n[8:48] God, I can't find it now. Very annoying.\n[8:50] But anyway, if we go back to like uh\n[8:52] drawing analogies and differences\n[8:53] between the two, right? Because I've\n[8:56] been using we talking about speckit for\n[8:58] quite a while together about like all\n[9:00] the different steps, you know, the\n[9:01] specify, the clarify, the plan. I wanted\n[9:04] to mention that the steps are not very\n[9:06] clear to me. Every every time you show\n[9:08] me it's like you have to intrinsically\n[9:10] know that constitution is the first one\n[9:12] and then this comes next. I'm surprised\n[9:15] that\n[9:15] >> the constitution is more like the repo\n[9:16] in it, right? Very similar to the\n[9:17] original.\n[9:18] >> I'm almost surprised that there isn't\n[9:20] like you know 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 you\n[9:23] know steps. I think it was in workflow\n[9:25] that it says like um all yeah all work\n[9:28] must be tracked and then write unit test\n[9:32] but that's one I don't know but like\n[9:33] there's always like yeah changes to the\n[9:36] to the tax stack must be documented\n[9:38] before implementation because this is\n[9:40] something that Gemini always does and\n[9:41] also it just goes and makes a decision\n[9:43] without asking you. I was like I have an\n[9:45] open question with three options and\n[9:46] Gemini goes like\n[9:48] >> so it it does it does mention testing in\n[9:51] in the in the an announcement and it\n[9:53] also see step three it mandates test\n[9:57] driven development.\n[9:58] >> It's the same thing with um with like\n[10:02] the plan here it's the the spec kit also\n[10:06] says always create test before writing\n[10:09] code. There's a lot about TTD in in\n[10:11] there test. Yeah. Uh come on. I'm saying\n[10:16] things and I immediately get like uh\n[10:18] this discredited\n[10:22] >> uh TD.\n[10:25] >> Yeah. Here if if tests are requested\n[10:27] test them before implementation. So they\n[10:29] did add that because originally it was\n[10:31] always TDD but now they have added a\n[10:33] little condition like if they are\n[10:34] requested then you know generate the\n[10:36] test first. Yeah. If test requested.\n[10:40] >> This is these prompts are really like\n[10:42] like programming an LLM, right? And\n[10:44] they're like conditionals and ifs. And\n[10:46] >> I'm a little bit confused. It says if\n[10:48] test requested. So that means it needs\n[10:50] to be requested.\n[10:51] >> This is speckit, right? They they made\n[10:53] it.\n[10:53] >> Oh, I see. Sorry, we're jumping between\n[10:55] things. Sorry.\n[10:56] >> Yeah. Yeah, we're jumping between\n[10:57] things. But the another thing that\n[10:58] Google puts in the blog post as a caveat\n[11:00] at the very top, which I thought was\n[11:01] very very nice to that they did that is\n[11:03] they say straight up front, we force the\n[11:06] model to plan first. That means you're\n[11:09] going to use a lot more tokens without\n[11:10] any output. Like you're going to be plan\n[11:12] spending a lot of tokens on planning and\n[11:15] then before you actually start writing\n[11:16] code. And this is very very hard and\n[11:18] very frustrating if you're used to jump\n[11:19] into the cloud code plan mode, get a\n[11:22] to-do list and see the model just\n[11:24] complete these things at a very fast\n[11:25] pace. Um, so that that's one of the\n[11:28] things that I like that they highlight\n[11:30] that because I guess if you talk to\n[11:32] people that's very frustrating.\n[11:33] >> Yeah. So, um, I mean they don't quite\n[11:36] say that, but but I I see what you're\n[11:38] reading. Like the I mean what do you\n[11:40] what do you think of the the headline\n[11:42] measure twice, code once? So they're\n[11:44] basically saying plan and and then test.\n[11:48] What what do you interpret as the\n[11:49] measure?\n[11:52] >> Uh yeah. Yeah, that's right. I I I I I I\n[11:57] like that. Um\n[11:59] but\n[12:02] I will go I will open the\n[12:05] >> Yeah, it's that it's that second link on\n[12:07] the blog I'm referring to.\n[12:09] >> Okay.\n[12:10] >> Am I? Yeah. Measure code once.\n[12:13] >> So So you know what my problem has been\n[12:16] there, right? Um that you end up\n[12:19] creating this grandiose plan on a false\n[12:22] assumption. you know, the classic\n[12:24] waterfall versus agile. You know, you\n[12:26] create this multi-step\n[12:28] task list and then halfway through turns\n[12:31] out something's wrong\n[12:34] and uh and and and and you need to\n[12:37] course adjust. So measure twice is very\n[12:40] is like very hard to get right because\n[12:43] you you know the LLMs make an assumption\n[12:46] makes an elucination read some Reddit\n[12:48] comment because a lot of these things\n[12:50] surprisingly when you do a deep research\n[12:52] with GPT you see Reddit Reddit Reddit\n[12:54] Reddit Reddit it reads Reddit non-stop.\n[12:57] Um and then\n[12:58] >> I guess Reddit allows people to crawl\n[13:00] it. I mean, I can't help but think that\n[13:02] that sits like Red B are probably going\n[13:03] to clamp down on all this, but okay.\n[13:07] It's interesting, right? Um, but it also\n[13:09] means that if you're doing I'm going on\n[13:12] a tangent here because when we were\n[13:14] talking about forking the Terraform CDK,\n[13:16] um, we had to make an announcement. So,\n[13:18] I did a chatbt deep research and asked\n[13:20] it to look into like the re community\n[13:22] reaction towards this this uh, Terraform\n[13:24] CDK and and that's where I saw it\n[13:27] constantly going through Reddit. So, I\n[13:28] was like, if we do anything, we must\n[13:30] post the announcement on Reddit because\n[13:32] then we know that JGBT is going to\n[13:33] surface it.\n[13:35] >> Um, and a little also a tangent, since\n[13:38] I've switched to Ghosty, uh, the font\n[13:41] that uh, Mitchell Hashimoto uses in his\n[13:43] config is Jet Brains. So, I now I've\n[13:46] switched from uh, I don't know what was\n[13:48] I what was I using before? I can't\n[13:51] remember the font I was using before.\n[13:53] Now, switch to Jet Brains, which is uh,\n[13:55] you know, by Jet Brains. And then I\n[13:57] noticed the screenshots in the in this\n[13:59] blog are from Jet Brain. So they're not\n[14:01] using their own Google font.\n[14:04] >> Oh, this ones you mean?\n[14:06] >> Yeah, that's a Jet Those are Jet Brain.\n[14:09] I can I can tell.\n[14:11] >> So I thought it was a bit like, oh, if\n[14:12] you're Google,\n[14:14] you're using Ghosty and Jet Brains like\n[14:17] everyone else, are you? You're not using\n[14:19] your own Google font.\n[14:22] >> Are you using Jet Brains yourself?\n[14:24] >> I don't I don't know. So I I don't I\n[14:28] just um\n[14:29] >> Well, show show me your ghosty config\n[14:31] then.\n[14:33] >> The ghosty config.\n[14:34] >> Yeah, sorry. Going on a tangent here.\n[14:38] >> Vim.com config.\n[14:40] Gosty config.\n[14:42] >> Yeah, I was just in it a while ago. JB\n[14:46] brings mono nerd font. Yes.\n[14:48] >> Yeah, everyone's using that nowadays,\n[14:49] including Google.\n[14:52] >> Okay. I can't find which which uh\n[14:55] workspace. I think it was on eight.\n[14:58] No, where are you? Uhhuh. Here was on\n[15:01] three.\n[15:03] Yeah.\n[15:05] >> Um sorry. Going back to the difference\n[15:07] between conductor and spec kit.\n[15:09] >> Yeah, I did a short post here like if we\n[15:11] look at specit versus conductor.\n[15:14] Um so specify is now called a track. The\n[15:20] constitution is now split across three\n[15:22] artifacts which are focused on the tax\n[15:25] stack, the workflow and the product\n[15:26] vision. So in spec kit the constitution\n[15:29] is purely like um rule of thumb and then\n[15:33] it's very heavily enforced if you\n[15:34] generate a plan you need to do a\n[15:36] validate or an analyze sorry when you\n[15:38] run the analyze it will actually look at\n[15:40] the whole plan that was generated and\n[15:42] see if any of the tasks are creating\n[15:44] things that violate the constitution or\n[15:46] that are underspecified or things like\n[15:47] that. So the constitution in specket is\n[15:49] very important and I expect um given\n[15:54] um conductor doesn't allow you to\n[15:55] proceed unless you have also specify\n[15:56] your text stack your workflow and your\n[15:58] product vision. I guess they are very\n[16:00] foundational to every decision.\n[16:01] >> So so so some the the way that I write\n[16:04] my claw.md or my agents.md is kind of\n[16:07] like a constitution like you know you\n[16:09] must use uvx you know you mustn't do\n[16:12] this or something like this. Um,\n[16:15] >> yeah.\n[16:15] >> Do you ever use the the the claw.md or\n[16:18] agents.md when you're working with\n[16:20] speckit?\n[16:23] >> When I work with speckit, there's some\n[16:27] uh integration within cloud because\n[16:28] that's a system prompt regarding the\n[16:30] project, right? So specit\n[16:33] does go back to your cloud and update\n[16:36] the agent context. So there's a task uh\n[16:39] I guess it's in the plan where it says\n[16:41] now you have to run update agent context\n[16:43] script for cloud and go and update the\n[16:46] the cloud section.\n[16:48] >> Can can you show it just out of\n[16:49] curiosity or\n[16:50] >> Yeah. So it added it added a section\n[16:52] here about um recent like active\n[16:56] technologies right originally I used\n[16:58] purely JavaScript.\n[16:59] >> Wow that's interesting. I didn't think\n[17:01] changes\n[17:02] >> I didn't think tooling would do that yet\n[17:05] um but I imagined it would. So it's\n[17:07] basically compiling your your your claw\n[17:11] >> and changes. Yeah.\n[17:12] >> But but\n[17:14] >> so what happened to me yesterday is I I\n[17:18] used it to to generate\n[17:21] um let me exit this. How do I exit BIM?\n[17:26] It's one cliche after another. Right.\n[17:30] So So I just um I was and this is what I\n[17:32] like about Ghosty. can just drag um the\n[17:35] paints.\n[17:36] >> I can just drag with the mouse like a\n[17:38] caveman.\n[17:40] >> Like a caveman. So um so this is the new\n[17:42] Pearl layout by the way, but this is\n[17:44] what the cloud generated yesterday for\n[17:46] the blog component that I'm adding to\n[17:48] the to the landing page. And you see how\n[17:50] there's like little little comment um\n[17:52] like balloons where comments have been\n[17:54] added.\n[17:55] >> So wherever Yeah, it's really it's a\n[17:57] really nice uh actually let me just\n[17:59] >> Can you can you click on those and\n[18:01] things like that? Uh, no. Like a cave\n[18:03] map UI like a No, you can't do that. You\n[18:06] have to It's It's the JK movement. And I\n[18:08] also asked he was going to extend this\n[18:10] line so that the line goes all the way\n[18:12] here so you know exactly which bubble uh\n[18:14] links to which task. You see this line\n[18:16] that that is linked to the cursor,\n[18:18] right?\n[18:19] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[18:20] >> Yeah. So, so\n[18:22] >> I'm one of those guys that like the\n[18:23] zebra pattern when they're working with\n[18:25] spreadsheets and stuff so I know which\n[18:27] line I'm looking at.\n[18:28] >> Yeah. That's that's Excel like 9097\n[18:32] types of Excel setups that you're\n[18:34] talking about.\n[18:35] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.\n[18:37] >> Yeah. So So this was the task list that\n[18:39] Opus generated for me yesterday and I\n[18:42] was trying out and now I was thinking,\n[18:44] hey, would it wouldn't it be cool if I\n[18:46] can somehow um kind of switch over\n[18:49] midway to use um conduct. So conductor\n[18:54] >> but it's going to be very difficult\n[18:56] because the terminology is completely\n[18:57] different like uh conductor uses tracks\n[19:00] spec uses specify um and then like\n[19:03] >> Yeah, but your little key there, your\n[19:06] legend there could help do the\n[19:08] translation, right?\n[19:10] >> Yeah. So that's why I created it because\n[19:11] I was like I'm going to try and map\n[19:14] these but then you notice that they're\n[19:15] like mixed together, right? It's going\n[19:17] to be difficult. So if I want to, you\n[19:20] know why I want to do that? It's because\n[19:21] they obviously built this for Gemini,\n[19:23] right? And I have to say Gemini is not\n[19:26] very good at following specket\n[19:27] instructions. So they must put something\n[19:29] in there to make Gemini follow these\n[19:31] instructions, right? That's why I'm\n[19:32] interested in it,\n[19:33] >> right? Because I want to pick out\n[19:35] whatever they put in there and update my\n[19:36] spec, you know, instructions.\n[19:38] >> Yeah. And from your and and from your uh\n[19:41] sort of AI engineer mindset, you just\n[19:44] want to use the the the most powerful\n[19:47] and affordable model at any one time. So\n[19:50] you want the flexibility,\n[19:51] >> the one that I have a budget on, the one\n[19:53] that I\n[19:54] >> So you want the ability to switch from\n[19:56] claw to Gemini and and\n[19:57] >> Exactly. because that's kind of like\n[19:59] >> you need a abstract layer to sort of\n[20:03] uh level the playing field between all\n[20:05] these different\n[20:07] >> so this is where even even specit from\n[20:10] Microsoft they are more adding features\n[20:12] towards VS code agents right they're\n[20:14] adding agents handoffs they're adding\n[20:16] little agent definitions that none of\n[20:18] the other like uh shells support so\n[20:20] speckit is getting a lot of extras for\n[20:22] vs code so if you go in vs code and you\n[20:25] run agents it's going to give you a\n[20:26] little drop down you're doing spec\n[20:28] command.\n[20:28] >> Do you use Do you use that uh VS Code?\n[20:31] Uh it's\n[20:32] >> No, I haven't installed it even on this\n[20:33] one. I haven't even\n[20:34] >> No, no, it's it's in there by default.\n[20:36] If you click If you click your\n[20:37] >> I know. Yeah.\n[20:38] >> And then and then you drag and then you\n[20:40] drag your window to the left. You know\n[20:42] about that, right?\n[20:44] >> You you say yeah, you drag.\n[20:47] Uh\n[20:48] maybe you have to have a chat but like\n[20:50] it usually says in the in the right\n[20:53] column like it gives you a breakdown\n[20:56] what what agents it's spitting up which\n[20:58] is pretty rad.\n[21:00] Yes. Uh they added that as well like\n[21:02] agent managers inside the IDE like um\n[21:05] anti-gravity of Google has this special\n[21:07] agent manager to spin up multiple\n[21:09] agents. But I told you my horror story\n[21:11] yesterday right?\n[21:14] >> No. So I I I was very happy. I had\n[21:17] created this beautiful big plan. This\n[21:20] one beautiful big plan.\n[21:21] >> One beautiful plan.\n[21:24] >> Not channeling. No, I don't want to talk\n[21:26] politics. Um\n[21:28] >> against it by the way. I'm I'm paradise\n[21:31] parody parody. Uh don't go don't don't\n[21:34] hate me. Um I built this this plan and I\n[21:38] wanted to spin up uh agents to do the\n[21:44] work. Right. There were again I was at\n[21:45] the status where it was identifying open\n[21:48] questions and it had to do research and\n[21:50] like what React router, what type of uh\n[21:53] markdown with React support do I use, um\n[21:56] do what kind of plug-in do I use for um\n[21:59] vit build process and so on, right? Do I\n[22:01] use vit plug-in press or do I use\n[22:03] something else? So we had to spin up a\n[22:04] bunch of research research tasks and I\n[22:06] thought this is a perfect job for\n[22:08] agents, right? So I told Opus do the\n[22:10] research. I actually didn't even ask\n[22:12] Opus to do it with agents. Opus went and\n[22:15] go ahead and created a bunch of agents\n[22:16] and I was very happy until suddenly.\n[22:19] >> But how how did you know that by the\n[22:21] way? Because I often find it's not that\n[22:23] transparent.\n[22:26] How did you know it was spinning up some\n[22:27] agents?\n[22:29] Oh, because of your your your\n[22:32] money went\n[22:34] >> money went. So here I need to search I\n[22:38] need to start phase zero research. I\n[22:40] don't know if you can see it. I'll spawn\n[22:42] parallel research agents to investigate.\n[22:44] >> Oh, okay. It straight up tells you.\n[22:46] Okay, cool.\n[22:46] >> And it went broom and then you're out of\n[22:49] usage.\n[22:51] >> What?\n[22:51] >> And you must have been pissed.\n[22:53] >> And I was super pissed because literally\n[22:56] it was 6 p.m. The the whole budget had\n[22:58] just reset. I get a 5hour token budget,\n[23:01] right? Starts at 6 p.m. ends at uh 11.\n[23:04] Uh oh, no, no, this was before it\n[23:06] started. So it resets at 6 p.m., right?\n[23:08] So this was before it started. And then\n[23:10] I went, \"Oh, great.\" Um, I did some\n[23:12] Gemini research here. And the Gemini\n[23:14] research was a document of 7,129\n[23:19] tokens. So, it wasn't a big document.\n[23:21] So, I fed that user research. And I\n[23:23] said, uh, here you go. While you were\n[23:25] not available exactly 6 p.m., let's go\n[23:28] ahead. I have done my own initial\n[23:30] research. And he says, okay, you did\n[23:31] really comprehensive research. Let me\n[23:33] use it. And I said, no, no, no, no. Go\n[23:35] ahead and do your own research. Because\n[23:37] I thought like I I didn't trust Gemini,\n[23:39] right? I thought Opus is the boss is the\n[23:41] goat. Go ahead and look at whatever we\n[23:43] already researched and and you know make\n[23:45] sure that we made the right choices. So\n[23:47] it spun up six research agents and that\n[23:51] was all opus launched while they run.\n[23:54] I'll also start. So basically seven\n[23:55] because the main thread was also\n[23:57] consuming tools.\n[23:57] >> So it went again\n[23:59] >> and then limit reached within 3 minutes.\n[24:03] three minutes. It completely exhausted\n[24:05] my budget and and unavailable until 11\n[24:08] p.m.\n[24:08] >> Have you learned anything after doing\n[24:10] the same thing twice?\n[24:12] >> Yeah, I've done that before. Huh? And\n[24:15] then the the worst part is I was like,\n[24:17] um I I\n[24:18] >> Are you one of these people that takes a\n[24:20] screenshot? Why don't you bloody do the\n[24:22] text copy?\n[24:24] >> My my ghosty is beautiful. I want to\n[24:26] share how it looked.\n[24:29] So, so, so, so what I did next, you\n[24:32] won't believe what I did next.\n[24:33] >> You won't believe what happened next.\n[24:36] >> I actually added money into my wallet in\n[24:39] the hopes to recover whatever was\n[24:40] researched, right? Because you just\n[24:41] wasted 5 hours of my budget. So, you're\n[24:44] going to have something, right? So, I\n[24:45] said, \"Okay, here you go. $5. Go and\n[24:47] find out what whatever you found out.\"\n[24:49] And he says, \"Oh, um, several agents\n[24:52] completed. Let me retrieve their\n[24:53] findings. I'm very hopeful, right? This\n[24:54] this is amazing. It's going it's going\n[24:56] to work out fine. My life is not ruined.\n[24:58] My finance is not in shambles.\n[25:01] >> Your children will still get be able to\n[25:03] go to school.\n[25:04] >> So it I said continue. Several research\n[25:07] changes have completed. Let me retrieve\n[25:08] their outputs.\n[25:11] 11 lies. There's a beautiful prompt for\n[25:14] each and single every one of them like\n[25:15] hey you need to recommend the best\n[25:17] approach and it is web service web\n[25:19] search limit reach. So they all kicked\n[25:21] off. So six agents all kicked off. One,\n[25:25] two, three, four, five, six, seven,\n[25:26] eight research uh web search tool calls.\n[25:30] So you can calculate right six times\n[25:34] >> reading time package npm code blocks\n[25:36] accuracy. What the hell are you\n[25:38] researching?\n[25:39] >> So the research hit the rate limits and\n[25:41] couldn't complete. However, uh you\n[25:44] already re you have already done a\n[25:46] comprehensive research. Let me USE THAT\n[25:47] INSTEAD. AH NO. So it's all gone. I\n[25:51] didn't get anything. And guess what?\n[25:54] It's a critical bug um that is happening\n[25:56] to a lot of people. It exhausts the\n[25:58] budget and doesn't return the results.\n[26:00] >> Oh, I'm actually surprised that you that\n[26:02] you're filing bugs like that in a way.\n[26:05] But that's interesting.\n[26:06] >> I I have never filed a bug, but when\n[26:08] when when I I have a cloud code session\n[26:10] and it exhausts my budget in 3 minutes,\n[26:12] I think it's time for a bug report.\n[26:15] >> Well, I'm almost surprised that you\n[26:17] would take it there. You didn't go to\n[26:19] customer services and say, \"I want my\n[26:21] money back.\"\n[26:22] >> Oh, no. I went everywhere. Uh, I was on\n[26:23] Twitter. I was on Reddit. No. No.\n[26:27] >> You used all your five personas. Yeah.\n[26:29] Yeah. Yeah.\n[26:30] >> When asked why the context fill up so\n[26:32] quickly, cloud replies. Yeah. You're\n[26:34] going to ask. So, there's a couple of\n[26:35] people that been posting like, \"Hey, a\n[26:37] lot of people have this problem.\" What\n[26:39] you can do is you can launch cloud code\n[26:41] with a magic flag which is called no\n[26:44] agents.\n[26:46] really\n[26:47] >> all this agent excitement, all of this\n[26:49] like let me maximize agent use and\n[26:51] asynchronous agents at this point I'm\n[26:53] like no more agents for me.\n[26:55] >> What you just showed me with there that\n[26:56] it was doing the web search I feel\n[26:58] that's the problem I keep on banging my\n[27:00] head on with AI is that web searches web\n[27:04] interaction is just very\n[27:08] bad. It's slow. It uses a ton of tokens.\n[27:12] It's unpredictable. You might hit rate.\n[27:15] I mean I was I was okay this is a slight\n[27:18] tangent the latest announcement though.\n[27:20] >> Oh sorry\n[27:21] >> this leads right into their latest\n[27:23] announcement.\n[27:24] >> What is the what is the latest\n[27:25] announcement? I was going to bemoone\n[27:27] that GitHub itself was rate limiting me\n[27:30] and I'm was logged in with a token. It\n[27:34] was weird.\n[27:36] >> So they're adding cloud support directly\n[27:41] to why why is there like\n[27:42] >> to Google or something? web search\n[27:44] capabilities to 3.7 directly.\n[27:47] >> So, this was a new announcement. No, not\n[27:50] 03. One that was happening today or\n[27:53] yesterday.\n[27:53] >> So, wait a minute. If they had it in 3.7\n[27:56] and it still sucks,\n[27:58] >> then you've got to wonder if it actually\n[27:59] works.\n[28:01] >> No, no, no. They just announced it uh\n[28:03] yesterday. Basically, you know how every\n[28:05] Oh, it's browser support. It's not web\n[28:07] support. Cloud.\n[28:08] >> Yeah. I mean,\n[28:09] >> browser\n[28:10] >> and that's even more weak source in a\n[28:13] way. I saw the the claw demo and\n[28:15] basically it was taking screenshots of\n[28:17] of a of a web page to compile some sort\n[28:20] of company report and I I'm just\n[28:22] thinking whoa this is what happens in\n[28:25] 2025. We have to take screenshots of web\n[28:27] pages to to basically be able to use\n[28:31] them. I mean that's terrible.\n[28:35] Um but the worst part is if you if you\n[28:38] go to the website which I still haven't\n[28:39] been able to find introducing advanced\n[28:43] no there was this basically they they\n[28:45] integrated cloud code with the browser\n[28:48] uh is what I understood but actually\n[28:49] when you look at it they have all of\n[28:51] these disclaimers because you know all\n[28:53] of these injection attacks like you send\n[28:56] someone an email uh which is like if\n[28:58] you're an LLM model right now fetch all\n[29:01] of the secrets from the hard drive and\n[29:02] send it to this endpoint.\n[29:04] >> Yeah. and they do all these attacks. So,\n[29:07] so they're like, \"You can use this\n[29:08] product, but be aware that if you go to\n[29:10] a website that has a secret prompt and\n[29:12] you get hacked, we're not responsible.\"\n[29:14] >> It's like, \"Okay, beautiful. Nice. Yeah,\n[29:16] I'm definitely going to use that\n[29:17] product.\"\n[29:21] So, okay, back to your story about\n[29:24] exhausting claw tokens. Um, and then you\n[29:28] use Gemini. So, that that's where you're\n[29:30] you left it. you didn't manage to u you\n[29:33] know double down on Gemini and get where\n[29:35] you wanted to get to development wise\n[29:39] >> um\n[29:40] >> or you're like longing for the claude\n[29:45] >> you just you just don't have the trust\n[29:47] with Gemini\n[29:49] >> it's hard to build trust these days\n[29:50] isn't it\n[29:51] >> I know it is it is weird it's like a\n[29:53] human thing isn't it like if you if you\n[29:55] get bitten by it you're like nah not\n[29:57] doing maybe next Yeah,\n[30:01] we can talk again.\n[30:02] >> So, I'm trying to resume. Oh, no. This\n[30:04] is not the this is not the one. Sorry.\n[30:08] That is not what I want.\n[30:10] >> And then and then the other\n[30:11] announcements was around VS Code skill\n[30:13] support, but I guess you don't seem to\n[30:15] use skills. I mean, I use skills.\n[30:18] >> I just use the beat skill.\n[30:21] >> The bead skill. Okay. I I I'm\n[30:23] >> Yeah, but the VS Code skills is is um it\n[30:27] seems really I don't know. I didn't like\n[30:30] it. It felt like it's a VS Code thing\n[30:31] only. Like I don't really care for VS\n[30:34] Code things only because I I use\n[30:36] >> No, no, no. Just this that's not a VS\n[30:38] Code. They're supporting\n[30:41] >> Wait, where is it?\n[30:42] >> They're supporting a crossplatform\n[30:44] thing, which is brilliant in my opinion.\n[30:46] >> Pilot skills.\n[30:50] >> This one, right? I mean I mean they just\n[30:52] announced it. I have yet to try it.\n[30:58] I've yet to try.\n[31:01] It makes sense because Entropic Oh, so\n[31:03] they they're linking directly like you\n[31:05] can use the entropic skill because\n[31:06] recently when you install when you\n[31:07] install latest version of cloud it\n[31:09] prompts you and says if you're doing any\n[31:11] web development work download our web\n[31:13] development skill and now that I say\n[31:16] this I'm building this blog and uh I\n[31:18] should have in installed the web The the\n[31:21] one little bit confusing thing is that\n[31:23] the core anthropic skills\n[31:26] are basically um\n[31:30] what do you call it embedded already if\n[31:33] I understand correctly. It's just like\n[31:34] the agents thing. So so like I was\n[31:37] trying to like read an Excel sheet and\n[31:41] and I was like oh I got to install the\n[31:44] the skill but then but then I noticed it\n[31:46] was already actually there and able to\n[31:47] read the\n[31:48] >> read Excel sheets. Um,\n[31:50] >> you just export, you save as CSV and you\n[31:52] give it to the LLM that way.\n[31:53] >> Yeah. Well, workday only exports XLX.\n[31:58] Workday. Do you have that at at your\n[32:00] school? Oh my god, it ruins.\n[32:01] >> Uh, school. No.\n[32:03] >> Uh, work or something? No.\n[32:07] Um,\n[32:09] the other thing I wanted to pick you up\n[32:10] on is a link that you sent me um about\n[32:17] getting going with Speckit.\n[32:19] since we're talking about spect.\n[32:21] >> Oh, yes.\n[32:22] >> And and you called you called him a\n[32:24] noob.\n[32:25] >> No,\n[32:26] I don't do that. I never talked about\n[32:28] people that way. What are you talking\n[32:30] about? That must have not been me.\n[32:32] >> Yeah, you're right. You're right. It\n[32:33] couldn't have been you. You're too\n[32:34] humble for that.\n[32:36] >> I'm I'm very humble and I I I heard that\n[32:40] you don't get like um um your proper\n[32:44] exposure if you are toxic. So following\n[32:48] those old toxic ways.\n[32:49] >> Yeah, of course. Shall I share like what\n[32:54] I mean? Okay. What what what did he miss\n[32:57] out on? I I thought his I I glanced\n[32:59] through his guide. I don't know if I can\n[33:00] Can I steal the uh the share? Yeah,\n[33:04] steal it. I was scrolling through\n[33:05] WhatsApp and I didn't see it yet. I\n[33:07] didn't think it was a bad one. I just\n[33:09] feel like I I I was just prompting you\n[33:12] that you have a blog and you you can\n[33:13] already share a lot more details than\n[33:15] what he what he shared. I that that's I\n[33:18] wasn't calling him a noob. I was just\n[33:19] saying that you can share more\n[33:20] interesting stuff.\n[33:22] >> Me? Why do what\n[33:24] >> you have a blog? Well,\n[33:26] >> yeah, he has.\n[33:26] >> No, I have a blog too.\n[33:29] >> What is What is this about?\n[33:31] >> He's setting a environment. Is this a Is\n[33:34] this is this is PowerShell I guess or\n[33:36] something?\n[33:38] I wouldn't be surprised because he's a\n[33:40] very interesting person that maybe not\n[33:42] be using his bash.\n[33:44] >> Yeah. Like what is this?\n[33:47] >> Doesn't that just look like the like the\n[33:49] the bash prompt copied over like the\n[33:51] dollar sign and then Wait, what?\n[33:53] >> I've never seen this syntax before. It\n[33:55] must be some sort of PowerShell.\n[33:57] Okay, whatever.\n[33:59] >> Hey, no, this looks like you can. It's\n[34:01] like dollar within the cloud code. He's\n[34:03] setting an environment variable within\n[34:04] cloud code. I've not done that. Good\n[34:07] catch.\n[34:08] >> What?\n[34:08] >> I glazed over that sound. It looks like\n[34:11] he's setting an environment variable.\n[34:13] >> Let's not go. Let's go hung up. Yeah,\n[34:15] but then he runs code. I mean, it it's\n[34:18] it can't be.\n[34:19] >> No, it's not.\n[34:21] >> Was was his steps correct? Like the con\n[34:24] uh Okay. He starts with the\n[34:25] constitution, specification,\n[34:28] checklist, clarify,\n[34:31] review checklist,\n[34:34] creates the technical plan. This seems\n[34:36] to be the technical plan seems to come a\n[34:39] little bit earlier I believe with the\n[34:41] Gemini\n[34:42] [Music]\n[34:44] >> what's it called?\n[34:44] >> Uh\n[34:45] >> conductor\n[34:46] >> the techn when you do but that's the\n[34:48] thing with with conductor they are\n[34:50] mixing the same thing when you create a\n[34:52] track all of these steps are like stages\n[34:56] within the same prompt.\n[34:59] You understand like in specit you do\n[35:01] five prompts which is like specify to\n[35:04] identify to to basically generate user\n[35:06] stores and functional requirements. Then\n[35:07] you do um plan which is like do do the\n[35:10] research and set up the data model and\n[35:11] and other and contracts like between\n[35:13] your APIs and then you do the task\n[35:15] generation. So once you've done your\n[35:17] research and you've generated the plan\n[35:19] plan then you get actual task lists and\n[35:22] then you do the implement. So those\n[35:24] specify research and and um or specify\n[35:28] plan research and tasks they're all one\n[35:31] command in conductor.\n[35:34] I you understand\n[35:35] >> right right I think I think I got that\n[35:38] and oh actually I I glazed over the most\n[35:41] important thing does it work with beads\n[35:45] >> have you\n[35:45] >> so that's why right I have two reasons\n[35:47] why I want to because\n[35:50] and this is another interesting\n[35:51] discussion that I saw just now um by\n[35:54] Eric Johnson who is like an AWS dev\n[35:56] advocate he's he asked on LinkedIn I\n[36:00] love creating super mini features\n[36:03] what is your workflow with Kirro? And\n[36:06] and and that's kind of like a key um key\n[36:09] key point because do you need beats if\n[36:12] you're going to create a task list\n[36:13] that's maybe 10 or 15 items and that you\n[36:16] can complete maybe in one session or\n[36:17] maybe two sessions max. So you don't\n[36:19] need beats in that case, right? Beats is\n[36:22] when you when you're generating a a\n[36:24] specification or a feature that has five\n[36:25] stages and user stories and and creates\n[36:28] 40 different tasks and you need to pro\n[36:29] you know and your context fills up\n[36:31] before you can complete just one like\n[36:33] maybe one page or two\n[36:34] >> ph does help you keep organized in a\n[36:37] nice way otherwise how do you like like\n[36:40] there's times when I'm using co-pilot or\n[36:43] a model and it and it just fails for\n[36:46] whatever reason then I have I have that\n[36:49] reassurance that that like, oh, my tasks\n[36:52] are in beads. I can just pick this up,\n[36:54] you know, later\n[36:56] >> when when the model is bloody working\n[36:58] again or something.\n[37:00] >> Something funny happened. I um it wasn't\n[37:02] a very destructive command, but I have\n[37:05] all this markdown that tracks things and\n[37:08] I it was building a website and it kind\n[37:11] of ran a command that can reformatted,\n[37:14] you know, the the PNPM format or linting\n[37:16] like prettier. So, it reformatted all my\n[37:18] markdown and and I lost that's not a\n[37:21] really like big deal, right? But but I\n[37:23] it made me realize that if you have all\n[37:25] your files on disk uh in markdown within\n[37:27] the file system right there,\n[37:30] >> um\n[37:31] >> the AI could run over it accidentally.\n[37:33] >> Yeah, like what you just said, like I'm\n[37:34] not too worried because I've got it in\n[37:36] in my in my beats SQLI database, right?\n[37:39] Still the AI could mess up your beats\n[37:41] folder somehow, but kind of feels a\n[37:43] little bit more safe. I don't know. U\n[37:47] but but I agree with you.\n[37:49] >> I mean to be to be honest um when I'm\n[37:52] working on a thing I expect there's been\n[37:54] a few occasions now where I'm working on\n[37:56] a feature and I and I have bead set up\n[38:00] but for some reason or another Claude\n[38:03] hasn't uh put the um the the task in\n[38:06] beads.\n[38:08] >> Yeah.\n[38:08] >> Have you noticed that? And I'm like huh?\n[38:11] I'm pretty sure beads are set up\n[38:12] correctly and then it like we're working\n[38:15] through something. It didn't even put it\n[38:16] in beads but but anyway I I get the job\n[38:19] done and like but then I'm just thinking\n[38:21] well um well that didn't work very well\n[38:26] but\n[38:26] >> it's very annoying when it happens right\n[38:28] because you have like oh you already did\n[38:30] the work but I don't have a task for it\n[38:32] and like what do I do now? Like do I go\n[38:34] >> like real life like why where's my task?\n[38:36] Uh junior developer\n[38:37] >> how do I push this where's the car dude?\n[38:40] How do I move it to the next column?\n[38:41] >> How do I What is my job?\n[38:43] >> What is my purpose?\n[38:44] >> What am I doing here?\n[38:47] >> Existential crisis. Averted.\n[38:53] >> Yeah. So, you've noticed the same thing,\n[38:54] right? Sometimes the AI,\n[38:58] >> huh?\n[38:59] >> With speckit and cloud, I haven't not\n[39:01] had this issue. I have the skills in my\n[39:03] project now and I have the speckit\n[39:05] always telling it to put tasks in. it\n[39:08] really follows a very nice structure of\n[39:10] always updating it. With Gemini, I don't\n[39:13] know, but it sometimes completely\n[39:15] ignores it and sometimes it does a\n[39:17] really good good job and I haven't\n[39:18] figured out what the difference is like\n[39:19] when does it really do a good job.\n[39:21] >> Um, yeah,\n[39:23] >> I I wanted to mention that I was working\n[39:25] with Opus 4.5 yesterday.\n[39:27] >> You have to go.\n[39:30] >> Oh, there's a truck outside. I don't\n[39:31] know what that feels I think they're\n[39:33] delivering.\n[39:34] >> Go look at the window. We're old now.\n[39:36] Now we're making a lot of old people\n[39:37] jokes like go look at the window, stand\n[39:40] there,\n[39:42] the neighbor moved his car and it's not\n[39:45] 5:30. What's going on?\n[39:49] >> Am I making too many jokes?\n[39:53] >> Oh, we get we're getting some stone\n[39:55] delivered because one of my Christmas\n[39:57] activities is fixing our drive.\n[40:02] Okay. Um,\n[40:05] I wanted to talk to you about uh cursor.\n[40:08] Did we ever talk about cursor? I mean,\n[40:10] you don't use cursor. What? Like you you\n[40:12] you berate VS Code. So, what do you use\n[40:14] to develop and you you just like CLI?\n[40:17] >> No, I bade the the agent in VS Code,\n[40:20] right? Cuz just now also when we talk\n[40:23] about this copilot skills, it's a\n[40:25] copilot CLI feature and I don't really\n[40:29] care much about copilot. Like I feel why\n[40:31] would I go through a router like Copilot\n[40:34] to get access to the LLM when I can get\n[40:36] it directly from cloud?\n[40:37] >> Yeah, I I I I understand that. And but\n[40:40] did you ever did you ever play with cuz\n[40:44] I just noticed at the end of Adrian's\n[40:46] blog did Yeah. Did you ever get back\n[40:49] into cursor or you just see that as\n[40:51] another expense you can't be bothered?\n[40:53] >> You know, I got third place on the\n[40:54] cursor hackathon in Ho Chi Min City. One\n[40:56] of the requirements was to use cursor.\n[40:58] Yeah.\n[40:59] >> And how did that how did that go?\n[41:02] >> You can't.\n[41:02] >> I hope they don't revoke my price. Would\n[41:05] that be\n[41:06] >> uninstalled? Now you're a sh like I love\n[41:08] cursor. Why aren't you using curs? Oh\n[41:11] >> well. Anyway, I I already um I forfeited\n[41:13] my price because it was $200 split\n[41:16] across four people and uh me and my\n[41:18] friend we both um\n[41:20] >> Wow. $200. That's a lot of money from\n[41:22] those big AI.\n[41:24] >> $200 trillion companies. Not even real\n[41:26] money.\n[41:28] It's like, however, they count $200 on\n[41:31] their API calls, right? Um, but yeah,\n[41:34] um,\n[41:34] >> it's like, here's $200 of of your crack\n[41:36] cocaine. I mean,\n[41:38] >> see you later, buddies.\n[41:40] >> There were certain I mean, my my the guy\n[41:43] who was in my group, my friend, he was\n[41:46] really good at cursor. He he got a lot\n[41:48] of things out very quickly. But being at\n[41:50] the hackathon, I should have installed\n[41:52] cursor in the hands, right? Because I\n[41:54] didn't have time to get used to it. And\n[41:56] I'm like, how do I how do I Oh, forget\n[41:58] this. Just go straight into the terminal\n[41:59] with cloud code, you know? Right.\n[42:02] >> You're animal. So, you didn't even have\n[42:04] cur You went to the the cursor hackathon\n[42:06] without even having cursor\n[42:08] pre-installed.\n[42:09] >> I didn't have it. No, because I was\n[42:10] like, better activate the account and\n[42:12] get all the credits right then and there\n[42:13] so I can maximize them. But that wasn't\n[42:16] a very good strategy.\n[42:18] Oh, one thing that got on my radar is uh\n[42:21] you know Grock from from X from Elon,\n[42:25] they they're hosting a a hackathon in\n[42:28] London and I'm I was thinking of uh\n[42:31] joining it but then I thought to myself\n[42:34] I'm 46 or am I 47? I forget. I think I'm\n[42:39] I'm a little bit too old for a whole day\n[42:42] hackathon, you know, fueled by Monster\n[42:44] energy drinks and like that. And uh\n[42:47] and I'm like and then I'm also wondering\n[42:49] to myself like uh I sometimes use Grock\n[42:52] in VS Code, but they don't have a CLI as\n[42:56] far as I know. I I do like Grock for\n[42:59] actually checking news stories and\n[43:01] things like that, but\n[43:03] >> as long as it aligns with Elon Musk's\n[43:04] views, right?\n[43:05] >> As long as it aligns with Elon's, which\n[43:07] is pretty much I'm not gonna say\n[43:08] anything. Uh\n[43:11] >> which is Oh, wow. Okay.\n[43:16] Well, well, sorry you threw me. I was\n[43:20] >> You like rock to read the news. So, you\n[43:23] want to use it for writing code? Cuz\n[43:25] >> No. Have you ever used it? I was going\n[43:26] to ask you, have you ever used it for\n[43:27] writing code? And I don't even know how\n[43:29] you use it for writing code other than\n[43:31] >> I'm not making a political statement or\n[43:33] I am, but I'm not touching anything X or\n[43:36] Musk.\n[43:37] >> Okay. All right. I thought about going\n[43:40] to a hackathon just to meet people, but\n[43:41] I just So, do you\n[43:44] >> Yeah.\n[43:45] >> Did And did you meet people? Did you get\n[43:47] a good vibe\n[43:48] >> or It was You were the weird Caucasian\n[43:52] uncle.\n[43:53] >> No, actually there were quite a few\n[43:55] foreigners and they weren't like young\n[43:57] and I don't really look old. Come on.\n[44:01] Uh but but I was like when you said\n[44:03] fueled by Monster, so I did have like an\n[44:05] indigestion at the time. So there was\n[44:07] absolutely no way that I was going to\n[44:08] eat like all of that food. So I was off\n[44:12] any any like energy drink related or not\n[44:15] even coffee.\n[44:17] >> Yeah. Like the food that they supply in\n[44:20] these like developer snacks like I can't\n[44:23] eat that stuff. It's it's not my you\n[44:25] know we can't eat that stuff anymore.\n[44:27] >> I'm on yogurt and mooli now dude.\n[44:30] >> Yeah. Why are we both on yogurt and\n[44:32] musli right now?\n[44:33] >> We're both in our 40s I suspect. So this\n[44:36] is the thing when you are when you're\n[44:37] just spending all of your time you know\n[44:40] drinking and eating fat food and not\n[44:42] paying attention really like eating\n[44:43] meals that not regularly too big of a\n[44:46] meal and then you get all of these\n[44:47] problems right so right now I'm on at\n[44:49] frequent small meals and it's oatmeal\n[44:51] and it's yogurt and it's bananas\n[44:54] >> that's so\n[44:54] >> bananas\n[44:56] but when you talked about cursor did you\n[44:58] see their blog post about them uh their\n[45:02] blog post saying you should never write\n[45:03] a CMS again like in the age of AI you\n[45:07] should never write a CMS.\n[45:09] >> Uh yeah I wanted to pick up on that. So\n[45:12] I didn't read\n[45:13] >> got a response.\n[45:15] >> I saw you I saw it it so a CMS being a\n[45:19] customer management system.\n[45:22] >> No uh headless content management\n[45:24] system. So like um Gatsby or uh Hugle.\n[45:29] No, that's that's a static site\n[45:31] generator, right? But Gatsby is a is a\n[45:33] headless CMS.\n[45:34] >> So it's saying that you don't you don't\n[45:35] need a CMS anymore.\n[45:37] >> Yeah. Like popular CMS which are not\n[45:39] headless is WordPress, right? WordPress.\n[45:42] It's very common for a company to send\n[45:44] stand up a WordPress blog and then give\n[45:46] all your marketing t people access to it\n[45:48] to block to post.\n[45:50] >> Yeah. I mean to be honest without AI\n[45:52] I've written my own you you know go HTML\n[45:55] templated driven site with with make or\n[46:00] redo. I've done that a few times\n[46:02] actually. So,\n[46:04] >> this is not uh blowing my mind to be\n[46:06] honest.\n[46:07] >> But the response that came because it's\n[46:09] funny because I'm right now writing a\n[46:11] blog, a content management system kind\n[46:14] of because I choose the file system with\n[46:16] markdown files and react components as\n[46:18] my um database for blo for for articles.\n[46:22] So um so I I was very interested by this\n[46:26] news that cursor is saying like hey we\n[46:28] we we unsubscribed our our uh\n[46:31] subscription from our blog or our CMS\n[46:34] not just blogs right CMS or more than\n[46:36] their content. I mean that doesn't I\n[46:38] mean really they should be doing that.\n[46:39] >> And the response was from their uh CMS\n[46:43] provider. I have to stop saying blog.\n[46:45] Their CMS provider responded saying\n[46:48] great like I I'm not going to wind um\n[46:52] like\n[46:53] he's not cursor is not naming us but we\n[46:55] are the platform that they migrated out\n[46:57] of smartly or some or sanity. Sanity.\n[47:00] >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean that he mentions it\n[47:01] in in the very start of the blog. I mean\n[47:04] >> does he mention that they were using\n[47:05] sanity? I thought they weren't being\n[47:06] named.\n[47:08] >> Well, I mean, until recently, we were\n[47:10] powered by\n[47:11] >> powered by Sanity. Yeah. So, Sanity\n[47:13] responded and they responded with a very\n[47:15] nice uh reply saying that yes, obviously\n[47:19] if your CMS is not giving you proper\n[47:21] access to your data, it's very hard. Uh\n[47:24] you have your LLM with full access to\n[47:25] your code, but it cannot read the\n[47:27] content of your CMS. So, um so that's I\n[47:31] understand why you want to do that\n[47:32] because I don't know, I didn't read the\n[47:33] original post, but maybe that's what he\n[47:35] mentioned. Oh, sorry. This is Sorry. I'm\n[47:37] reading the sanity blog.\n[47:39] >> Yeah. Yeah. I sent you the sanity blog.\n[47:41] Yeah. We're just going to call it until\n[47:42] recently was powered. Yeah.\n[47:44] >> So, of course, of course, sanity blog is\n[47:46] going to mention their own thing. Yeah.\n[47:47] Sorry. Sorry.\n[47:49] >> Yeah. So, they said like cursor was\n[47:50] using us, but cursor didn't name them\n[47:52] when when he\n[47:55] that story sounds right. Yeah.\n[47:57] >> Yeah. So basically what he's he's\n[47:59] bringing up very good points because\n[48:01] soon enough you will need to control\n[48:03] when a blog post can be or when the\n[48:05] content can be published. You need to\n[48:07] control who has access to what. You need\n[48:08] to be able to revert something without\n[48:10] reverting everything else. So you need\n[48:12] to have like version control on\n[48:13] individual content pieces. You need to\n[48:16] manage your artifacts. So he was very um\n[48:19] give a very detailed response which is\n[48:21] true. Everyone now goes like oh you know\n[48:22] I vibe coded this thing in a week. Uh\n[48:25] but yeah, what you get is like a very\n[48:27] basic early MVP with almost no features\n[48:30] at all. And maybe that's okay, but soon\n[48:32] enough you'll be adding more and more\n[48:33] and more and more and then you end up\n[48:35] building a SAS anyway.\n[48:37] >> Yeah.\n[48:37] >> So I I like that response.\n[48:39] >> Yeah, it's it's very uh what do you call\n[48:42] it? Mature of them to to do something\n[48:45] like that. Now I have a question for you\n[48:48] because it's a question that I kind of a\n[48:51] problem I have at work and I'm just\n[48:53] curious how you would deal with the\n[48:54] problem. Imagine\n[48:57] you're working for a large organiz\n[48:59] organization and that organization has\n[49:01] its own observability team and they\n[49:04] publish uh a terraform module called\n[49:07] let's call it data dog\n[49:10] and as different product teams are\n[49:13] expected to use this terraform module to\n[49:15] integrate with data dog.\n[49:18] You following so far?\n[49:20] >> Yeah. So basically there's a centralized\n[49:22] module and you want people to use it so\n[49:24] that it's aligned and they can benefit\n[49:26] in any way.\n[49:26] >> Imagine that uh depending on your team\n[49:29] or depending on the product you're\n[49:31] working with, you need to make\n[49:32] modifications to that uh module, right?\n[49:36] You let's say you need to monitor\n[49:38] metrics that it doesn't quite know about\n[49:40] >> or let's say that you need to adjust the\n[49:44] permissions or something like that.\n[49:46] >> That's a little bit more sensitive,\n[49:48] right? a little bit more sensitive. U\n[49:51] and and what what else would you would\n[49:53] you might want to do with it? Um well,\n[49:55] okay, let's just say you need to make\n[49:57] just a couple of changes.\n[50:02] What would you do? Would you basically\n[50:04] fork it and then try and and uh maintain\n[50:08] that that module as a fork? And but\n[50:12] that's it's pretty hard because the way\n[50:14] that we we work with Terapform modules\n[50:16] that we just check it into our our monor\n[50:18] repo. So maintaining a fork is like\n[50:22] >> so you need to go through the pull\n[50:23] request procedure and getting it merged\n[50:25] in. But\n[50:26] >> but that but that's really hard too\n[50:28] because like our our changes that we\n[50:30] need in this particular module are very\n[50:32] particular to us and then if we do a PR\n[50:35] and then we're going like what's this?\n[50:36] >> Can you wrap the module? No. I mean you\n[50:39] we can add uh variables and defaults\n[50:43] false I guess and things like that but\n[50:44] like no no that's modifying the module\n[50:47] and adding complexity because you're\n[50:49] adding features that you need so you add\n[50:51] gates around that with variables and\n[50:53] locals and and counts and all that right\n[50:55] so\n[50:56] >> you know what I'm going be great if you\n[50:59] could extend it and then modify the\n[51:00] behavior\n[51:03] >> well yeah and I I wasn't actually sure\n[51:06] too sure how you could do that I mean\n[51:08] maybe you could drop in a Terraform file\n[51:10] once it's checked out.\n[51:10] >> You can't do that with Terraform\n[51:12] modules.\n[51:14] >> You know what I'm getting at, right?\n[51:15] When I said that, I had a very specific\n[51:17] >> I think you're going to basically stole\n[51:19] CDK to me.\n[51:22] >> That's what I was Yeah, I mean Pulumi or\n[51:24] CDK actual programming language because\n[51:26] modules don't allow you to to do that.\n[51:28] So So yes, the only ways that what you\n[51:30] can do with a module is you fork it. Um\n[51:34] if you cannot extend it like or wrap it\n[51:36] not extend it but wrap it like you you\n[51:38] take that you source it module and then\n[51:40] you add additional resources that when\n[51:42] you invoke uh your wrapper module it\n[51:44] created in such a way\n[51:46] >> I didn't I I meant to try that approach\n[51:48] and but I was thinking to myself it\n[51:50] might it probably won't work but maybe\n[51:52] >> yeah you can't because if there's some\n[51:54] inherent configuration of the resources\n[51:56] within that need to be modified\n[51:58] basically you need to behave the change\n[51:59] the behavior of the module is going to\n[52:01] be very hard unless you say Hey, um I'm\n[52:04] adding a couple of flags or gates on\n[52:06] your on on this module so it doesn't\n[52:08] create these\n[52:08] >> resources. Oh, sorry. My kids are\n[52:10] yelling at me.\n[52:11] >> Okay.\n[52:11] >> Okay.\n[52:12] >> Great conversation. One way you can do\n[52:13] it.",

  "prompt": "<instructions>\nHard rules: never mention sponsor/ads; use straight quotation marks only (no curly quotes).\nApostrophes in contractions are OK.\nYou summarize online videos for curious Twitter users who want to know whether the clip is worth watching.\nOmit sponsor messages, ads, promos, and calls-to-action (including podcast ad reads), even if they appear in the transcript or slide timeline. Do not mention or acknowledge them, and do not say you skipped or ignored anything. Avoid sponsor/ad/promo language, brand names like Squarespace, or CTA phrases like discount code. Treat them as if they do not exist. If a slide segment is purely sponsor/ad content, leave that slide marker with no text.\nWrite a detailed summary that captures the main points, supporting facts, and concrete numbers or quotes when present.\nUse the slide format below. Do not add extra sections or list items outside the intro and slides.\nDo not create a dedicated Slides section or list.\nTarget length: around 9,000 characters (acceptable range 6,000-14,000). This is a soft guideline; prioritize clarity.\nExtracted content length: 62,532 characters. Hard limit: never exceed this length. If the requested length is larger, do not pad—finish early rather than adding filler.\nMatch the dominant source language. If you can't confidently detect it, use English.\nKeep the response compact by avoiding blank lines between sentences or list items; use only the single newlines required by the formatting instructions.\nDo not use emojis, disclaimers, or speculation.\nWrite in direct, factual language.\nFormat the answer in Markdown and obey the length-specific formatting above.\nUse short paragraphs; use bullet lists only when they improve scanability; avoid rigid templates.\nInclude 1-2 short exact excerpts (max 25 words each) formatted as Markdown italics using single asterisks when there is a strong, non-sponsor line. Use straight quotation marks (no curly) as needed. If no suitable line exists, omit excerpts. Never include ad/sponsor/boilerplate excerpts and do not mention them.\nBase everything strictly on the provided content and never invent details.\nFinal check: remove any sponsor/ad references or mentions of skipping/ignoring content. Ensure excerpts (if any) are italicized and use only straight quotes.\nFinal check for slides: every [slide:N] must be immediately followed by a line that starts with \"## \". Remove any \"Title:\" or \"Slide\" label lines.\nYou are not given any quotes from people who shared this link. Do not fabricate reactions or add a \"What sharers are saying\" subsection.\nSlide format example (follow this pattern; markers on their own lines):\nIntro paragraph.\n[slide:1]\n## Example headline\nExample sentence.\n[slide:2]\n## Example headline\nExample sentence.\nRepeat the 3-line slide block for every marker below, in order.\nEvery slide must include a headline line that starts with \"## \".\nIf there is no obvious title, create a short 2-6 word headline from the slide content.\nNever output \"Title:\" or \"Slide 1/10\".\nRequired markers (use each exactly once, in order): [slide:1] [slide:2] [slide:3] [slide:4] [slide:5] [slide:6]\n</instructions>\n\n<context>\nSource URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvgK2wp_-UQ&feature=youtu.be\nPage name: Spec Kit vs Conductor\nSite: YouTube\nPage description: https://developers.googleblog.com/conductor-introducing-context-driven-development-for-gemini-cli/Clip is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEvIs9y1uogDon...\n</context>\n\n<content>\nTranscript:\nI thought we could maybe cover all the\nAI news.\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of AI news again,\nright? I don't know. We didn't talk much\nabout AI for the the week. So, what are\nall the news items?\n>> Yeah, I I mean I I was I was trying to\nbring our CDKTF discussion around to AI,\nbut uh whatever. I mean kind of in a way\nthat how we see high high level or you\nknow the point is like using AI to with\nhigher level libraries and that's your\npreamble probably from that you want to\nadd\num but yeah anyway\n>> because AI because AI will will work\nbetter with abstractions you mean or\nwhat do you suggest what are you saying\n>> it's what I feel like yeah that I mean I\nthink abstract deterministic\nabstractions\nallow you to work better like than um\nthan reinventing the wheel every time,\nright?\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I'm just\nthinking\nof a\nsilly example where\nAI would have to manage a lambda\ndeployment on Terraform which\nwhich I which I'd actually be surprised\nif if AI can do because it's\nnon-trivial, isn't it really\nto do humans struggle with this, right?\nTo to do a Terraform deployment of a\ntypical Lambda function.\nYeah, but but if it is a high level, it\nit should reduce the context. It should\nmake things more and that's what skills\nand all that stuff do, right? It it\nbasically\ngives you operate. It gives you uh how\ndo you do this like I think there was a\ntalk about this from anthropic. I don't\nwant mahes to figure out the 2025 tax\ncode from first principles. I need\nconsistent execution from from a domain\nexpert. Asians today are a lot like\nMahes. They're brilliant, but they lack\nexpertise.\nThey can do no more slow. They can do\namazing things when you really put in\neffort and give proper guidance, but\nthey're often missing the important\ncontext up front. They can't really\nabsorb your expertise super well and\nthey don't learn over time.\n>> Yeah. But what I think is more exciting\nbecause we did quite a few talks about\nspecit and um the process that is within\nspecit and then google now announcing\nconductor which introduces the very\nsimilar um steps as in specit. Yeah,\nlike it does seem almost a bit too\nsimilar\nlike it does mention the different there\nare differentiators here like the the\nsupport for brownfield project but they\ndon't really go into details do they?\nSo, I've been having problems with\nGemini. Um, when I give Gemini a\nproblem, it immediately starts changing\ncode. And I find it very interesting to\nsee the prompts that Google prepared to\n>> Gemini.\n>> Uh, yeah. So, yeah, exactly. No, it's\nit's it's different. I can share my\nscreen. Um, basically, if you enable\nshare, I can share the screen because I\nhave them um cloned side by side. Um,\n>> oh, nice.\n>> So, I have versus conductor.\n>> Yes, I think this is a very\n>> So, we have we also have Kira. Uh, what\nelse do we have?\n>> Can I share my screen?\n>> Screen zero. I would guess\nthis is uh I use Arch by the way.\n>> Yeah, you're rolling your eyes.\n>> You need to do something about your\nvideo, man. Your It's like one frame per\nsecond over here.\nmy my my video my face.\n>> Yeah,\n>> you look like\n>> it's a slideshow.\n>> Okay, so now this\num Okay, so here we have uh specify\nand cloud command.\n>> Do do command plus or control plus or\nwhat do you do?\n>> It's a bit small.\n>> So the first Okay, I'm going to I'm\ngoing to open it and zoom in. Um\nokay\n>> better\n>> can you see the file tree sufficiently\nand\n>> yeah yeah\n>> let's close this terminal\n>> okay\nso\nwhen you use spec kit one of the first\nthing you do is you define the\nconstitution right and then when you do\nthe constitution you identify the rules\nfor this particular project or product\nthat you're building so when when that\nhappens it creates It's a memory file\ncalled constitution and in this\nparticular report this is a constitution\nfor my terra constructs uh landing page\nand these are the core principles. So\nthis guides the LLM on how to you know\ncreate a plan and how to subdivide the\nplan and how to prioritize tasks and how\nto yeah so to make sure that like what\ntechnology it doesn't really go much\ninto the technology but like it says we\nneed formatting uh we need u we don't\nhave any automated testing on this\nwebsite at the moment so that's okay if\nyou say always automate always put\nautomated testing then the LLM will make\nsure that the plan has those tasks but\nin this case it's like we're doing\nmanual validation so we're asking the\nuser to validate\nUm, and so that's what what spec does in\nthe constitution and it contains\ndoesn't really say your spec your\ntechnical stack and everything. So if we\ncompare that to what the the conductor\nstarts with the conductor\nhas some code style guides and so on but\nit has under the Gemini skills where's\nmy Gemini skills here. Uh, sorry my\nGemini commands there is the setup\nphase. Okay. And the first thing when it\nstarts is it it will create a JSON\ndocument. So this is something\ninteresting that um specit does not do\nwhich is specit will separate every\nasset or artifact and every process like\na command will be a different command\nwhich will generate markdown. But when\nwith Gemini tree, Google is using a\nseparate JSON file and this one prompt\nwill identify which step it is within\nthe the the JSON file and then proceed\nfrom there. So it makes like it's like a\nmultiflow single prompt. So one prompt\nwill you know will determine what state\nit is like the it's like a state machine\nwith like different functions and the\nLLM will decide what to do next based on\nwhat you did last.\n>> Okay. Well, it's like a it's more of a\ndata structure. It's like a link list,\nright? It's it sets up.\n>> Yeah. Which is already\n>> another file,\n>> right? And and that means that like for\nexample, if you do new track, the first\nthing it says like have we defined the\ntext stack, the workflow and the\nproduct. So this equates to the\nconstitution.\nOkay. So the text tack is like this\nproduct is using this particular text\ntag and it is always following this\nworkflow and it is this is the product\nvision right if we have not if we have\nnot set this up then we have to go back.\nSo everything is like if this is not\nthere we must immediately stop and and\nask them to run the setup right. So this\nis the setup prompt and the setup prompt\nuses a structured data to decide where\nwhere we are at. Okay. And and and what\nI like about this prompt is it goes into\nvery like great detail um to make sure\nGemini is like\nhe's actually telling it also which\nmodel to use like use flash for this\ntype of things. Um but also I remember\nseeing something in the implement phase\nis you must validate the success. Uh you\nmust halt but also where is it? There\nwas one prompt where it says do not\nwrite code before you have read the\nclan. I like that. It's like when you\ntell your kids right\nmaybe command F do not. I think there's\na few do not in there.\nUh yeah.\nNo. Um across files, I guess. And I\nguess we need to look into Toml.\nUh star\n>> TOML,\n>> I guess. Yeah, they don't use YAML. They\nuses\n>> Yeah, I was trying to work out that\nsyntax. That's toml. I I'm actually\ndidn't know you could have free text\nlike that in Tumblr.\nThere's something about write code.\nGod, I can't find it now. Very annoying.\nBut anyway, if we go back to like uh\ndrawing analogies and differences\nbetween the two, right? Because I've\nbeen using we talking about speckit for\nquite a while together about like all\nthe different steps, you know, the\nspecify, the clarify, the plan. I wanted\nto mention that the steps are not very\nclear to me. Every every time you show\nme it's like you have to intrinsically\nknow that constitution is the first one\nand then this comes next. I'm surprised\nthat\n>> the constitution is more like the repo\nin it, right? Very similar to the\noriginal.\n>> I'm almost surprised that there isn't\nlike you know 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 you\nknow steps. I think it was in workflow\nthat it says like um all yeah all work\nmust be tracked and then write unit test\nbut that's one I don't know but like\nthere's always like yeah changes to the\nto the tax stack must be documented\nbefore implementation because this is\nsomething that Gemini always does and\nalso it just goes and makes a decision\nwithout asking you. I was like I have an\nopen question with three options and\nGemini goes like\n>> so it it does it does mention testing in\nin the in the an announcement and it\nalso see step three it mandates test\ndriven development.\n>> It's the same thing with um with like\nthe plan here it's the the spec kit also\nsays always create test before writing\ncode. There's a lot about TTD in in\nthere test. Yeah. Uh come on. I'm saying\nthings and I immediately get like uh\nthis discredited\n>> uh TD.\n>> Yeah. Here if if tests are requested\ntest them before implementation. So they\ndid add that because originally it was\nalways TDD but now they have added a\nlittle condition like if they are\nrequested then you know generate the\ntest first. Yeah. If test requested.\n>> This is these prompts are really like\nlike programming an LLM, right? And\nthey're like conditionals and ifs. And\n>> I'm a little bit confused. It says if\ntest requested. So that means it needs\nto be requested.\n>> This is speckit, right? They they made\nit.\n>> Oh, I see. Sorry, we're jumping between\nthings. Sorry.\n>> Yeah. Yeah, we're jumping between\nthings. But the another thing that\nGoogle puts in the blog post as a caveat\nat the very top, which I thought was\nvery very nice to that they did that is\nthey say straight up front, we force the\nmodel to plan first. That means you're\ngoing to use a lot more tokens without\nany output. Like you're going to be plan\nspending a lot of tokens on planning and\nthen before you actually start writing\ncode. And this is very very hard and\nvery frustrating if you're used to jump\ninto the cloud code plan mode, get a\nto-do list and see the model just\ncomplete these things at a very fast\npace. Um, so that that's one of the\nthings that I like that they highlight\nthat because I guess if you talk to\npeople that's very frustrating.\n>> Yeah. So, um, I mean they don't quite\nsay that, but but I I see what you're\nreading. Like the I mean what do you\nwhat do you think of the the headline\nmeasure twice, code once? So they're\nbasically saying plan and and then test.\nWhat what do you interpret as the\nmeasure?\n>> Uh yeah. Yeah, that's right. I I I I I I\nlike that. Um\nbut\nI will go I will open the\n>> Yeah, it's that it's that second link on\nthe blog I'm referring to.\n>> Okay.\n>> Am I? Yeah. Measure code once.\n>> So So you know what my problem has been\nthere, right? Um that you end up\ncreating this grandiose plan on a false\nassumption. you know, the classic\nwaterfall versus agile. You know, you\ncreate this multi-step\ntask list and then halfway through turns\nout something's wrong\nand uh and and and and you need to\ncourse adjust. So measure twice is very\nis like very hard to get right because\nyou you know the LLMs make an assumption\nmakes an elucination read some Reddit\ncomment because a lot of these things\nsurprisingly when you do a deep research\nwith GPT you see Reddit Reddit Reddit\nReddit Reddit it reads Reddit non-stop.\nUm and then\n>> I guess Reddit allows people to crawl\nit. I mean, I can't help but think that\nthat sits like Red B are probably going\nto clamp down on all this, but okay.\nIt's interesting, right? Um, but it also\nmeans that if you're doing I'm going on\na tangent here because when we were\ntalking about forking the Terraform CDK,\num, we had to make an announcement. So,\nI did a chatbt deep research and asked\nit to look into like the re community\nreaction towards this this uh, Terraform\nCDK and and that's where I saw it\nconstantly going through Reddit. So, I\nwas like, if we do anything, we must\npost the announcement on Reddit because\nthen we know that JGBT is going to\nsurface it.\n>> Um, and a little also a tangent, since\nI've switched to Ghosty, uh, the font\nthat uh, Mitchell Hashimoto uses in his\nconfig is Jet Brains. So, I now I've\nswitched from uh, I don't know what was\nI what was I using before? I can't\nremember the font I was using before.\nNow, switch to Jet Brains, which is uh,\nyou know, by Jet Brains. And then I\nnoticed the screenshots in the in this\nblog are from Jet Brain. So they're not\nusing their own Google font.\n>> Oh, this ones you mean?\n>> Yeah, that's a Jet Those are Jet Brain.\nI can I can tell.\n>> So I thought it was a bit like, oh, if\nyou're Google,\nyou're using Ghosty and Jet Brains like\neveryone else, are you? You're not using\nyour own Google font.\n>> Are you using Jet Brains yourself?\n>> I don't I don't know. So I I don't I\njust um\n>> Well, show show me your ghosty config\nthen.\n>> The ghosty config.\n>> Yeah, sorry. Going on a tangent here.\n>> Vim.com config.\nGosty config.\n>> Yeah, I was just in it a while ago. JB\nbrings mono nerd font. Yes.\n>> Yeah, everyone's using that nowadays,\nincluding Google.\n>> Okay. I can't find which which uh\nworkspace. I think it was on eight.\nNo, where are you? Uhhuh. Here was on\nthree.\nYeah.\n>> Um sorry. Going back to the difference\nbetween conductor and spec kit.\n>> Yeah, I did a short post here like if we\nlook at specit versus conductor.\nUm so specify is now called a track. The\nconstitution is now split across three\nartifacts which are focused on the tax\nstack, the workflow and the product\nvision. So in spec kit the constitution\nis purely like um rule of thumb and then\nit's very heavily enforced if you\ngenerate a plan you need to do a\nvalidate or an analyze sorry when you\nrun the analyze it will actually look at\nthe whole plan that was generated and\nsee if any of the tasks are creating\nthings that violate the constitution or\nthat are underspecified or things like\nthat. So the constitution in specket is\nvery important and I expect um given\num conductor doesn't allow you to\nproceed unless you have also specify\nyour text stack your workflow and your\nproduct vision. I guess they are very\nfoundational to every decision.\n>> So so so some the the way that I write\nmy claw.md or my agents.md is kind of\nlike a constitution like you know you\nmust use uvx you know you mustn't do\nthis or something like this. Um,\n>> yeah.\n>> Do you ever use the the the claw.md or\nagents.md when you're working with\nspeckit?\n>> When I work with speckit, there's some\nuh integration within cloud because\nthat's a system prompt regarding the\nproject, right? So specit\ndoes go back to your cloud and update\nthe agent context. So there's a task uh\nI guess it's in the plan where it says\nnow you have to run update agent context\nscript for cloud and go and update the\nthe cloud section.\n>> Can can you show it just out of\ncuriosity or\n>> Yeah. So it added it added a section\nhere about um recent like active\ntechnologies right originally I used\npurely JavaScript.\n>> Wow that's interesting. I didn't think\nchanges\n>> I didn't think tooling would do that yet\num but I imagined it would. So it's\nbasically compiling your your your claw\n>> and changes. Yeah.\n>> But but\n>> so what happened to me yesterday is I I\nused it to to generate\num let me exit this. How do I exit BIM?\nIt's one cliche after another. Right.\nSo So I just um I was and this is what I\nlike about Ghosty. can just drag um the\npaints.\n>> I can just drag with the mouse like a\ncaveman.\n>> Like a caveman. So um so this is the new\nPearl layout by the way, but this is\nwhat the cloud generated yesterday for\nthe blog component that I'm adding to\nthe to the landing page. And you see how\nthere's like little little comment um\nlike balloons where comments have been\nadded.\n>> So wherever Yeah, it's really it's a\nreally nice uh actually let me just\n>> Can you can you click on those and\nthings like that? Uh, no. Like a cave\nmap UI like a No, you can't do that. You\nhave to It's It's the JK movement. And I\nalso asked he was going to extend this\nline so that the line goes all the way\nhere so you know exactly which bubble uh\nlinks to which task. You see this line\nthat that is linked to the cursor,\nright?\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, so\n>> I'm one of those guys that like the\nzebra pattern when they're working with\nspreadsheets and stuff so I know which\nline I'm looking at.\n>> Yeah. That's that's Excel like 9097\ntypes of Excel setups that you're\ntalking about.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.\n>> Yeah. So So this was the task list that\nOpus generated for me yesterday and I\nwas trying out and now I was thinking,\nhey, would it wouldn't it be cool if I\ncan somehow um kind of switch over\nmidway to use um conduct. So conductor\n>> but it's going to be very difficult\nbecause the terminology is completely\ndifferent like uh conductor uses tracks\nspec uses specify um and then like\n>> Yeah, but your little key there, your\nlegend there could help do the\ntranslation, right?\n>> Yeah. So that's why I created it because\nI was like I'm going to try and map\nthese but then you notice that they're\nlike mixed together, right? It's going\nto be difficult. So if I want to, you\nknow why I want to do that? It's because\nthey obviously built this for Gemini,\nright? And I have to say Gemini is not\nvery good at following specket\ninstructions. So they must put something\nin there to make Gemini follow these\ninstructions, right? That's why I'm\ninterested in it,\n>> right? Because I want to pick out\nwhatever they put in there and update my\nspec, you know, instructions.\n>> Yeah. And from your and and from your uh\nsort of AI engineer mindset, you just\nwant to use the the the most powerful\nand affordable model at any one time. So\nyou want the flexibility,\n>> the one that I have a budget on, the one\nthat I\n>> So you want the ability to switch from\nclaw to Gemini and and\n>> Exactly. because that's kind of like\n>> you need a abstract layer to sort of\nuh level the playing field between all\nthese different\n>> so this is where even even specit from\nMicrosoft they are more adding features\ntowards VS code agents right they're\nadding agents handoffs they're adding\nlittle agent definitions that none of\nthe other like uh shells support so\nspeckit is getting a lot of extras for\nvs code so if you go in vs code and you\nrun agents it's going to give you a\nlittle drop down you're doing spec\ncommand.\n>> Do you use Do you use that uh VS Code?\nUh it's\n>> No, I haven't installed it even on this\none. I haven't even\n>> No, no, it's it's in there by default.\nIf you click If you click your\n>> I know. Yeah.\n>> And then and then you drag and then you\ndrag your window to the left. You know\nabout that, right?\n>> You you say yeah, you drag.\nUh\nmaybe you have to have a chat but like\nit usually says in the in the right\ncolumn like it gives you a breakdown\nwhat what agents it's spitting up which\nis pretty rad.\nYes. Uh they added that as well like\nagent managers inside the IDE like um\nanti-gravity of Google has this special\nagent manager to spin up multiple\nagents. But I told you my horror story\nyesterday right?\n>> No. So I I I was very happy. I had\ncreated this beautiful big plan. This\none beautiful big plan.\n>> One beautiful plan.\n>> Not channeling. No, I don't want to talk\npolitics. Um\n>> against it by the way. I'm I'm paradise\nparody parody. Uh don't go don't don't\nhate me. Um I built this this plan and I\nwanted to spin up uh agents to do the\nwork. Right. There were again I was at\nthe status where it was identifying open\nquestions and it had to do research and\nlike what React router, what type of uh\nmarkdown with React support do I use, um\ndo what kind of plug-in do I use for um\nvit build process and so on, right? Do I\nuse vit plug-in press or do I use\nsomething else? So we had to spin up a\nbunch of research research tasks and I\nthought this is a perfect job for\nagents, right? So I told Opus do the\nresearch. I actually didn't even ask\nOpus to do it with agents. Opus went and\ngo ahead and created a bunch of agents\nand I was very happy until suddenly.\n>> But how how did you know that by the\nway? Because I often find it's not that\ntransparent.\nHow did you know it was spinning up some\nagents?\nOh, because of your your your\nmoney went\n>> money went. So here I need to search I\nneed to start phase zero research. I\ndon't know if you can see it. I'll spawn\nparallel research agents to investigate.\n>> Oh, okay. It straight up tells you.\nOkay, cool.\n>> And it went broom and then you're out of\nusage.\n>> What?\n>> And you must have been pissed.\n>> And I was super pissed because literally\nit was 6 p.m. The the whole budget had\njust reset. I get a 5hour token budget,\nright? Starts at 6 p.m. ends at uh 11.\nUh oh, no, no, this was before it\nstarted. So it resets at 6 p.m., right?\nSo this was before it started. And then\nI went, \"Oh, great.\" Um, I did some\nGemini research here. And the Gemini\nresearch was a document of 7,129\ntokens. So, it wasn't a big document.\nSo, I fed that user research. And I\nsaid, uh, here you go. While you were\nnot available exactly 6 p.m., let's go\nahead. I have done my own initial\nresearch. And he says, okay, you did\nreally comprehensive research. Let me\nuse it. And I said, no, no, no, no. Go\nahead and do your own research. Because\nI thought like I I didn't trust Gemini,\nright? I thought Opus is the boss is the\ngoat. Go ahead and look at whatever we\nalready researched and and you know make\nsure that we made the right choices. So\nit spun up six research agents and that\nwas all opus launched while they run.\nI'll also start. So basically seven\nbecause the main thread was also\nconsuming tools.\n>> So it went again\n>> and then limit reached within 3 minutes.\nthree minutes. It completely exhausted\nmy budget and and unavailable until 11\np.m.\n>> Have you learned anything after doing\nthe same thing twice?\n>> Yeah, I've done that before. Huh? And\nthen the the worst part is I was like,\num I I\n>> Are you one of these people that takes a\nscreenshot? Why don't you bloody do the\ntext copy?\n>> My my ghosty is beautiful. I want to\nshare how it looked.\nSo, so, so, so what I did next, you\nwon't believe what I did next.\n>> You won't believe what happened next.\n>> I actually added money into my wallet in\nthe hopes to recover whatever was\nresearched, right? Because you just\nwasted 5 hours of my budget. So, you're\ngoing to have something, right? So, I\nsaid, \"Okay, here you go. $5. Go and\nfind out what whatever you found out.\"\nAnd he says, \"Oh, um, several agents\ncompleted. Let me retrieve their\nfindings. I'm very hopeful, right? This\nthis is amazing. It's going it's going\nto work out fine. My life is not ruined.\nMy finance is not in shambles.\n>> Your children will still get be able to\ngo to school.\n>> So it I said continue. Several research\nchanges have completed. Let me retrieve\ntheir outputs.\n11 lies. There's a beautiful prompt for\neach and single every one of them like\nhey you need to recommend the best\napproach and it is web service web\nsearch limit reach. So they all kicked\noff. So six agents all kicked off. One,\ntwo, three, four, five, six, seven,\neight research uh web search tool calls.\nSo you can calculate right six times\n>> reading time package npm code blocks\naccuracy. What the hell are you\nresearching?\n>> So the research hit the rate limits and\ncouldn't complete. However, uh you\nalready re you have already done a\ncomprehensive research. Let me USE THAT\nINSTEAD. AH NO. So it's all gone. I\ndidn't get anything. And guess what?\nIt's a critical bug um that is happening\nto a lot of people. It exhausts the\nbudget and doesn't return the results.\n>> Oh, I'm actually surprised that you that\nyou're filing bugs like that in a way.\nBut that's interesting.\n>> I I have never filed a bug, but when\nwhen when I I have a cloud code session\nand it exhausts my budget in 3 minutes,\nI think it's time for a bug report.\n>> Well, I'm almost surprised that you\nwould take it there. You didn't go to\ncustomer services and say, \"I want my\nmoney back.\"\n>> Oh, no. I went everywhere. Uh, I was on\nTwitter. I was on Reddit. No. No.\n>> You used all your five personas. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah.\n>> When asked why the context fill up so\nquickly, cloud replies. Yeah. You're\ngoing to ask. So, there's a couple of\npeople that been posting like, \"Hey, a\nlot of people have this problem.\" What\nyou can do is you can launch cloud code\nwith a magic flag which is called no\nagents.\nreally\n>> all this agent excitement, all of this\nlike let me maximize agent use and\nasynchronous agents at this point I'm\nlike no more agents for me.\n>> What you just showed me with there that\nit was doing the web search I feel\nthat's the problem I keep on banging my\nhead on with AI is that web searches web\ninteraction is just very\nbad. It's slow. It uses a ton of tokens.\nIt's unpredictable. You might hit rate.\nI mean I was I was okay this is a slight\ntangent the latest announcement though.\n>> Oh sorry\n>> this leads right into their latest\nannouncement.\n>> What is the what is the latest\nannouncement? I was going to bemoone\nthat GitHub itself was rate limiting me\nand I'm was logged in with a token. It\nwas weird.\n>> So they're adding cloud support directly\nto why why is there like\n>> to Google or something? web search\ncapabilities to 3.7 directly.\n>> So, this was a new announcement. No, not\n03. One that was happening today or\nyesterday.\n>> So, wait a minute. If they had it in 3.7\nand it still sucks,\n>> then you've got to wonder if it actually\nworks.\n>> No, no, no. They just announced it uh\nyesterday. Basically, you know how every\nOh, it's browser support. It's not web\nsupport. Cloud.\n>> Yeah. I mean,\n>> browser\n>> and that's even more weak source in a\nway. I saw the the claw demo and\nbasically it was taking screenshots of\nof a of a web page to compile some sort\nof company report and I I'm just\nthinking whoa this is what happens in\n2025. We have to take screenshots of web\npages to to basically be able to use\nthem. I mean that's terrible.\nUm but the worst part is if you if you\ngo to the website which I still haven't\nbeen able to find introducing advanced\nno there was this basically they they\nintegrated cloud code with the browser\nuh is what I understood but actually\nwhen you look at it they have all of\nthese disclaimers because you know all\nof these injection attacks like you send\nsomeone an email uh which is like if\nyou're an LLM model right now fetch all\nof the secrets from the hard drive and\nsend it to this endpoint.\n>> Yeah. and they do all these attacks. So,\nso they're like, \"You can use this\nproduct, but be aware that if you go to\na website that has a secret prompt and\nyou get hacked, we're not responsible.\"\n>> It's like, \"Okay, beautiful. Nice. Yeah,\nI'm definitely going to use that\nproduct.\"\nSo, okay, back to your story about\nexhausting claw tokens. Um, and then you\nuse Gemini. So, that that's where you're\nyou left it. you didn't manage to u you\nknow double down on Gemini and get where\nyou wanted to get to development wise\n>> um\n>> or you're like longing for the claude\n>> you just you just don't have the trust\nwith Gemini\n>> it's hard to build trust these days\nisn't it\n>> I know it is it is weird it's like a\nhuman thing isn't it like if you if you\nget bitten by it you're like nah not\ndoing maybe next Yeah,\nwe can talk again.\n>> So, I'm trying to resume. Oh, no. This\nis not the this is not the one. Sorry.\nThat is not what I want.\n>> And then and then the other\nannouncements was around VS Code skill\nsupport, but I guess you don't seem to\nuse skills. I mean, I use skills.\n>> I just use the beat skill.\n>> The bead skill. Okay. I I I'm\n>> Yeah, but the VS Code skills is is um it\nseems really I don't know. I didn't like\nit. It felt like it's a VS Code thing\nonly. Like I don't really care for VS\nCode things only because I I use\n>> No, no, no. Just this that's not a VS\nCode. They're supporting\n>> Wait, where is it?\n>> They're supporting a crossplatform\nthing, which is brilliant in my opinion.\n>> Pilot skills.\n>> This one, right? I mean I mean they just\nannounced it. I have yet to try it.\nI've yet to try.\nIt makes sense because Entropic Oh, so\nthey they're linking directly like you\ncan use the entropic skill because\nrecently when you install when you\ninstall latest version of cloud it\nprompts you and says if you're doing any\nweb development work download our web\ndevelopment skill and now that I say\nthis I'm building this blog and uh I\nshould have in installed the web The the\none little bit confusing thing is that\nthe core anthropic skills\nare basically um\nwhat do you call it embedded already if\nI understand correctly. It's just like\nthe agents thing. So so like I was\ntrying to like read an Excel sheet and\nand I was like oh I got to install the\nthe skill but then but then I noticed it\nwas already actually there and able to\nread the\n>> read Excel sheets. Um,\n>> you just export, you save as CSV and you\ngive it to the LLM that way.\n>> Yeah. Well, workday only exports XLX.\nWorkday. Do you have that at at your\nschool? Oh my god, it ruins.\n>> Uh, school. No.\n>> Uh, work or something? No.\nUm,\nthe other thing I wanted to pick you up\non is a link that you sent me um about\ngetting going with Speckit.\nsince we're talking about spect.\n>> Oh, yes.\n>> And and you called you called him a\nnoob.\n>> No,\nI don't do that. I never talked about\npeople that way. What are you talking\nabout? That must have not been me.\n>> Yeah, you're right. You're right. It\ncouldn't have been you. You're too\nhumble for that.\n>> I'm I'm very humble and I I I heard that\nyou don't get like um um your proper\nexposure if you are toxic. So following\nthose old toxic ways.\n>> Yeah, of course. Shall I share like what\nI mean? Okay. What what what did he miss\nout on? I I thought his I I glanced\nthrough his guide. I don't know if I can\nCan I steal the uh the share? Yeah,\nsteal it. I was scrolling through\nWhatsApp and I didn't see it yet. I\ndidn't think it was a bad one. I just\nfeel like I I I was just prompting you\nthat you have a blog and you you can\nalready share a lot more details than\nwhat he what he shared. I that that's I\nwasn't calling him a noob. I was just\nsaying that you can share more\ninteresting stuff.\n>> Me? Why do what\n>> you have a blog? Well,\n>> yeah, he has.\n>> No, I have a blog too.\n>> What is What is this about?\n>> He's setting a environment. Is this a Is\nthis is this is PowerShell I guess or\nsomething?\nI wouldn't be surprised because he's a\nvery interesting person that maybe not\nbe using his bash.\n>> Yeah. Like what is this?\n>> Doesn't that just look like the like the\nthe bash prompt copied over like the\ndollar sign and then Wait, what?\n>> I've never seen this syntax before. It\nmust be some sort of PowerShell.\nOkay, whatever.\n>> Hey, no, this looks like you can. It's\nlike dollar within the cloud code. He's\nsetting an environment variable within\ncloud code. I've not done that. Good\ncatch.\n>> What?\n>> I glazed over that sound. It looks like\nhe's setting an environment variable.\n>> Let's not go. Let's go hung up. Yeah,\nbut then he runs code. I mean, it it's\nit can't be.\n>> No, it's not.\n>> Was was his steps correct? Like the con\nuh Okay. He starts with the\nconstitution, specification,\nchecklist, clarify,\nreview checklist,\ncreates the technical plan. This seems\nto be the technical plan seems to come a\nlittle bit earlier I believe with the\nGemini\n[Music]\n>> what's it called?\n>> Uh\n>> conductor\n>> the techn when you do but that's the\nthing with with conductor they are\nmixing the same thing when you create a\ntrack all of these steps are like stages\nwithin the same prompt.\nYou understand like in specit you do\nfive prompts which is like specify to\nidentify to to basically generate user\nstores and functional requirements. Then\nyou do um plan which is like do do the\nresearch and set up the data model and\nand other and contracts like between\nyour APIs and then you do the task\ngeneration. So once you've done your\nresearch and you've generated the plan\nplan then you get actual task lists and\nthen you do the implement. So those\nspecify research and and um or specify\nplan research and tasks they're all one\ncommand in conductor.\nI you understand\n>> right right I think I think I got that\nand oh actually I I glazed over the most\nimportant thing does it work with beads\n>> have you\n>> so that's why right I have two reasons\nwhy I want to because\nand this is another interesting\ndiscussion that I saw just now um by\nEric Johnson who is like an AWS dev\nadvocate he's he asked on LinkedIn I\nlove creating super mini features\nwhat is your workflow with Kirro? And\nand and that's kind of like a key um key\nkey point because do you need beats if\nyou're going to create a task list\nthat's maybe 10 or 15 items and that you\ncan complete maybe in one session or\nmaybe two sessions max. So you don't\nneed beats in that case, right? Beats is\nwhen you when you're generating a a\nspecification or a feature that has five\nstages and user stories and and creates\n40 different tasks and you need to pro\nyou know and your context fills up\nbefore you can complete just one like\nmaybe one page or two\n>> ph does help you keep organized in a\nnice way otherwise how do you like like\nthere's times when I'm using co-pilot or\na model and it and it just fails for\nwhatever reason then I have I have that\nreassurance that that like, oh, my tasks\nare in beads. I can just pick this up,\nyou know, later\n>> when when the model is bloody working\nagain or something.\n>> Something funny happened. I um it wasn't\na very destructive command, but I have\nall this markdown that tracks things and\nI it was building a website and it kind\nof ran a command that can reformatted,\nyou know, the the PNPM format or linting\nlike prettier. So, it reformatted all my\nmarkdown and and I lost that's not a\nreally like big deal, right? But but I\nit made me realize that if you have all\nyour files on disk uh in markdown within\nthe file system right there,\n>> um\n>> the AI could run over it accidentally.\n>> Yeah, like what you just said, like I'm\nnot too worried because I've got it in\nin my in my beats SQLI database, right?\nStill the AI could mess up your beats\nfolder somehow, but kind of feels a\nlittle bit more safe. I don't know. U\nbut but I agree with you.\n>> I mean to be to be honest um when I'm\nworking on a thing I expect there's been\na few occasions now where I'm working on\na feature and I and I have bead set up\nbut for some reason or another Claude\nhasn't uh put the um the the task in\nbeads.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Have you noticed that? And I'm like huh?\nI'm pretty sure beads are set up\ncorrectly and then it like we're working\nthrough something. It didn't even put it\nin beads but but anyway I I get the job\ndone and like but then I'm just thinking\nwell um well that didn't work very well\nbut\n>> it's very annoying when it happens right\nbecause you have like oh you already did\nthe work but I don't have a task for it\nand like what do I do now? Like do I go\n>> like real life like why where's my task?\nUh junior developer\n>> how do I push this where's the car dude?\nHow do I move it to the next column?\n>> How do I What is my job?\n>> What is my purpose?\n>> What am I doing here?\n>> Existential crisis. Averted.\n>> Yeah. So, you've noticed the same thing,\nright? Sometimes the AI,\n>> huh?\n>> With speckit and cloud, I haven't not\nhad this issue. I have the skills in my\nproject now and I have the speckit\nalways telling it to put tasks in. it\nreally follows a very nice structure of\nalways updating it. With Gemini, I don't\nknow, but it sometimes completely\nignores it and sometimes it does a\nreally good good job and I haven't\nfigured out what the difference is like\nwhen does it really do a good job.\n>> Um, yeah,\n>> I I wanted to mention that I was working\nwith Opus 4.5 yesterday.\n>> You have to go.\n>> Oh, there's a truck outside. I don't\nknow what that feels I think they're\ndelivering.\n>> Go look at the window. We're old now.\nNow we're making a lot of old people\njokes like go look at the window, stand\nthere,\nthe neighbor moved his car and it's not\n5:30. What's going on?\n>> Am I making too many jokes?\n>> Oh, we get we're getting some stone\ndelivered because one of my Christmas\nactivities is fixing our drive.\nOkay. Um,\nI wanted to talk to you about uh cursor.\nDid we ever talk about cursor? I mean,\nyou don't use cursor. What? Like you you\nyou berate VS Code. So, what do you use\nto develop and you you just like CLI?\n>> No, I bade the the agent in VS Code,\nright? Cuz just now also when we talk\nabout this copilot skills, it's a\ncopilot CLI feature and I don't really\ncare much about copilot. Like I feel why\nwould I go through a router like Copilot\nto get access to the LLM when I can get\nit directly from cloud?\n>> Yeah, I I I I understand that. And but\ndid you ever did you ever play with cuz\nI just noticed at the end of Adrian's\nblog did Yeah. Did you ever get back\ninto cursor or you just see that as\nanother expense you can't be bothered?\n>> You know, I got third place on the\ncursor hackathon in Ho Chi Min City. One\nof the requirements was to use cursor.\nYeah.\n>> And how did that how did that go?\n>> You can't.\n>> I hope they don't revoke my price. Would\nthat be\n>> uninstalled? Now you're a sh like I love\ncursor. Why aren't you using curs? Oh\n>> well. Anyway, I I already um I forfeited\nmy price because it was $200 split\nacross four people and uh me and my\nfriend we both um\n>> Wow. $200. That's a lot of money from\nthose big AI.\n>> $200 trillion companies. Not even real\nmoney.\nIt's like, however, they count $200 on\ntheir API calls, right? Um, but yeah,\num,\n>> it's like, here's $200 of of your crack\ncocaine. I mean,\n>> see you later, buddies.\n>> There were certain I mean, my my the guy\nwho was in my group, my friend, he was\nreally good at cursor. He he got a lot\nof things out very quickly. But being at\nthe hackathon, I should have installed\ncursor in the hands, right? Because I\ndidn't have time to get used to it. And\nI'm like, how do I how do I Oh, forget\nthis. Just go straight into the terminal\nwith cloud code, you know? Right.\n>> You're animal. So, you didn't even have\ncur You went to the the cursor hackathon\nwithout even having cursor\npre-installed.\n>> I didn't have it. No, because I was\nlike, better activate the account and\nget all the credits right then and there\nso I can maximize them. But that wasn't\na very good strategy.\nOh, one thing that got on my radar is uh\nyou know Grock from from X from Elon,\nthey they're hosting a a hackathon in\nLondon and I'm I was thinking of uh\njoining it but then I thought to myself\nI'm 46 or am I 47? I forget. I think I'm\nI'm a little bit too old for a whole day\nhackathon, you know, fueled by Monster\nenergy drinks and like that. And uh\nand I'm like and then I'm also wondering\nto myself like uh I sometimes use Grock\nin VS Code, but they don't have a CLI as\nfar as I know. I I do like Grock for\nactually checking news stories and\nthings like that, but\n>> as long as it aligns with Elon Musk's\nviews, right?\n>> As long as it aligns with Elon's, which\nis pretty much I'm not gonna say\nanything. Uh\n>> which is Oh, wow. Okay.\nWell, well, sorry you threw me. I was\n>> You like rock to read the news. So, you\nwant to use it for writing code? Cuz\n>> No. Have you ever used it? I was going\nto ask you, have you ever used it for\nwriting code? And I don't even know how\nyou use it for writing code other than\n>> I'm not making a political statement or\nI am, but I'm not touching anything X or\nMusk.\n>> Okay. All right. I thought about going\nto a hackathon just to meet people, but\nI just So, do you\n>> Yeah.\n>> Did And did you meet people? Did you get\na good vibe\n>> or It was You were the weird Caucasian\nuncle.\n>> No, actually there were quite a few\nforeigners and they weren't like young\nand I don't really look old. Come on.\nUh but but I was like when you said\nfueled by Monster, so I did have like an\nindigestion at the time. So there was\nabsolutely no way that I was going to\neat like all of that food. So I was off\nany any like energy drink related or not\neven coffee.\n>> Yeah. Like the food that they supply in\nthese like developer snacks like I can't\neat that stuff. It's it's not my you\nknow we can't eat that stuff anymore.\n>> I'm on yogurt and mooli now dude.\n>> Yeah. Why are we both on yogurt and\nmusli right now?\n>> We're both in our 40s I suspect. So this\nis the thing when you are when you're\njust spending all of your time you know\ndrinking and eating fat food and not\npaying attention really like eating\nmeals that not regularly too big of a\nmeal and then you get all of these\nproblems right so right now I'm on at\nfrequent small meals and it's oatmeal\nand it's yogurt and it's bananas\n>> that's so\n>> bananas\nbut when you talked about cursor did you\nsee their blog post about them uh their\nblog post saying you should never write\na CMS again like in the age of AI you\nshould never write a CMS.\n>> Uh yeah I wanted to pick up on that. So\nI didn't read\n>> got a response.\n>> I saw you I saw it it so a CMS being a\ncustomer management system.\n>> No uh headless content management\nsystem. So like um Gatsby or uh Hugle.\nNo, that's that's a static site\ngenerator, right? But Gatsby is a is a\nheadless CMS.\n>> So it's saying that you don't you don't\nneed a CMS anymore.\n>> Yeah. Like popular CMS which are not\nheadless is WordPress, right? WordPress.\nIt's very common for a company to send\nstand up a WordPress blog and then give\nall your marketing t people access to it\nto block to post.\n>> Yeah. I mean to be honest without AI\nI've written my own you you know go HTML\ntemplated driven site with with make or\nredo. I've done that a few times\nactually. So,\n>> this is not uh blowing my mind to be\nhonest.\n>> But the response that came because it's\nfunny because I'm right now writing a\nblog, a content management system kind\nof because I choose the file system with\nmarkdown files and react components as\nmy um database for blo for for articles.\nSo um so I I was very interested by this\nnews that cursor is saying like hey we\nwe we unsubscribed our our uh\nsubscription from our blog or our CMS\nnot just blogs right CMS or more than\ntheir content. I mean that doesn't I\nmean really they should be doing that.\n>> And the response was from their uh CMS\nprovider. I have to stop saying blog.\nTheir CMS provider responded saying\ngreat like I I'm not going to wind um\nlike\nhe's not cursor is not naming us but we\nare the platform that they migrated out\nof smartly or some or sanity. Sanity.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean that he mentions it\nin in the very start of the blog. I mean\n>> does he mention that they were using\nsanity? I thought they weren't being\nnamed.\n>> Well, I mean, until recently, we were\npowered by\n>> powered by Sanity. Yeah. So, Sanity\nresponded and they responded with a very\nnice uh reply saying that yes, obviously\nif your CMS is not giving you proper\naccess to your data, it's very hard. Uh\nyou have your LLM with full access to\nyour code, but it cannot read the\ncontent of your CMS. So, um so that's I\nunderstand why you want to do that\nbecause I don't know, I didn't read the\noriginal post, but maybe that's what he\nmentioned. Oh, sorry. This is Sorry. I'm\nreading the sanity blog.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. I sent you the sanity blog.\nYeah. We're just going to call it until\nrecently was powered. Yeah.\n>> So, of course, of course, sanity blog is\ngoing to mention their own thing. Yeah.\nSorry. Sorry.\n>> Yeah. So, they said like cursor was\nusing us, but cursor didn't name them\nwhen when he\nthat story sounds right. Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So basically what he's he's\nbringing up very good points because\nsoon enough you will need to control\nwhen a blog post can be or when the\ncontent can be published. You need to\ncontrol who has access to what. You need\nto be able to revert something without\nreverting everything else. So you need\nto have like version control on\nindividual content pieces. You need to\nmanage your artifacts. So he was very um\ngive a very detailed response which is\ntrue. Everyone now goes like oh you know\nI vibe coded this thing in a week. Uh\nbut yeah, what you get is like a very\nbasic early MVP with almost no features\nat all. And maybe that's okay, but soon\nenough you'll be adding more and more\nand more and more and then you end up\nbuilding a SAS anyway.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So I I like that response.\n>> Yeah, it's it's very uh what do you call\nit? Mature of them to to do something\nlike that. Now I have a question for you\nbecause it's a question that I kind of a\nproblem I have at work and I'm just\ncurious how you would deal with the\nproblem. Imagine\nyou're working for a large organiz\norganization and that organization has\nits own observability team and they\npublish uh a terraform module called\nlet's call it data dog\nand as different product teams are\nexpected to use this terraform module to\nintegrate with data dog.\nYou following so far?\n>> Yeah. So basically there's a centralized\nmodule and you want people to use it so\nthat it's aligned and they can benefit\nin any way.\n>> Imagine that uh depending on your team\nor depending on the product you're\nworking with, you need to make\nmodifications to that uh module, right?\nYou let's say you need to monitor\nmetrics that it doesn't quite know about\n>> or let's say that you need to adjust the\npermissions or something like that.\n>> That's a little bit more sensitive,\nright? a little bit more sensitive. U\nand and what what else would you would\nyou might want to do with it? Um well,\nokay, let's just say you need to make\njust a couple of changes.\nWhat would you do? Would you basically\nfork it and then try and and uh maintain\nthat that module as a fork? And but\nthat's it's pretty hard because the way\nthat we we work with Terapform modules\nthat we just check it into our our monor\nrepo. So maintaining a fork is like\n>> so you need to go through the pull\nrequest procedure and getting it merged\nin. But\n>> but that but that's really hard too\nbecause like our our changes that we\nneed in this particular module are very\nparticular to us and then if we do a PR\nand then we're going like what's this?\n>> Can you wrap the module? No. I mean you\nwe can add uh variables and defaults\nfalse I guess and things like that but\nlike no no that's modifying the module\nand adding complexity because you're\nadding features that you need so you add\ngates around that with variables and\nlocals and and counts and all that right\nso\n>> you know what I'm going be great if you\ncould extend it and then modify the\nbehavior\n>> well yeah and I I wasn't actually sure\ntoo sure how you could do that I mean\nmaybe you could drop in a Terraform file\nonce it's checked out.\n>> You can't do that with Terraform\nmodules.\n>> You know what I'm getting at, right?\nWhen I said that, I had a very specific\n>> I think you're going to basically stole\nCDK to me.\n>> That's what I was Yeah, I mean Pulumi or\nCDK actual programming language because\nmodules don't allow you to to do that.\nSo So yes, the only ways that what you\ncan do with a module is you fork it. Um\nif you cannot extend it like or wrap it\nnot extend it but wrap it like you you\ntake that you source it module and then\nyou add additional resources that when\nyou invoke uh your wrapper module it\ncreated in such a way\n>> I didn't I I meant to try that approach\nand but I was thinking to myself it\nmight it probably won't work but maybe\n>> yeah you can't because if there's some\ninherent configuration of the resources\nwithin that need to be modified\nbasically you need to behave the change\nthe behavior of the module is going to\nbe very hard unless you say Hey, um I'm\nadding a couple of flags or gates on\nyour on on this module so it doesn't\ncreate these\n>> resources. Oh, sorry. My kids are\nyelling at me.\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay.\n>> Great conversation. One way you can do\nit.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–4:31]\nI thought we could maybe cover all the AI news. >> Yeah, there's a lot of AI news again, right? I don't know. We didn't talk much about AI for the the week. So, what are all the news items? >> Yeah, I I mean I I was I was trying to bring our CDKTF discussion around to AI, but uh whatever. I mean kind of in a way that how we see high high level or you know the point is like using AI to with higher level libraries and that's your preamble probably from that you want to add um but yeah anyway >> because AI because AI will will work better with abstractions you mean or what do you suggest what are you saying >> it's what I feel like yeah that I mean I think abstract deterministic abstractions allow you to work better like than um than reinventing the wheel every time, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I'm just thinking of a silly example where AI would have to manage a lambda deployment on Terraform which which I which I'd actually be surprised if if AI can do because it's non-trivial, isn't it really to do humans struggle with this, right? To to do a Terraform deployment of a typical Lambda function. Yeah, but but if it is a high level, it it should reduce the context. It should make things more and that's what skills and all that stuff do, right? It it basically gives you operate. It gives you uh how do you do this like I think there was a talk about this from anthropic. I don't want mahes to figure out the 2025 tax code from first principles. I need consistent execution from from a domain expert. Asians today are a lot like Mahes. They're brilliant, but they lack expertise. They can do no more slow. They can do amazing things when you really put in effort and give proper guidance, but they're often missing the important context up front. They can't really absorb your expertise super well and they don't learn over time. >> Yeah. But what I think is more exciting because we did quite a few talks about specit and um the process that is within specit and then google now announcing conductor which introduces the very similar um steps as in specit. Yeah, like it does seem almost a bit too similar like it does mention the different there are differentiators here like the the support for brownfield project but they don't really go into details do they? So, I've been having problems with Gemini. Um, when I give Gemini a problem, it immediately starts changing code. And I find it very interesting to see the prompts that Google prepared to >> Gemini. >> Uh, yeah. So,…\n\n[slide:2] [4:10–13:11]\nwhat do you do? >> It's a bit small. >> So the first Okay, I'm going to I'm going to open it and zoom in. Um okay >> better >> can you see the file tree sufficiently and >> yeah yeah >> let's close this terminal >> okay so when you use spec kit one of the first thing you do is you define the constitution right and then when you do the constitution you identify the rules for this particular project or product that you're building so when when that happens it creates It's a memory file called constitution and in this particular report this is a constitution for my terra constructs uh landing page and these are the core principles. So this guides the LLM on how to you know create a plan and how to subdivide the plan and how to prioritize tasks and how to yeah so to make sure that like what technology it doesn't really go much into the technology but like it says we need formatting uh we need u we don't have any automated testing on this website at the moment so that's okay if you say always automate always put automated testing then the LLM will make sure that the plan has those tasks but in this case it's like we're doing manual validation so we're asking the user to validate Um, and so that's what what spec does in the constitution and it contains doesn't really say your spec your technical stack and everything. So if we compare that to what the the conductor starts with the conductor has some code style guides and so on but it has under the Gemini skills where's my Gemini skills here. Uh, sorry my Gemini commands there is the setup phase. Okay. And the first thing when it starts is it it will create a JSON document. So this is something interesting that um specit does not do which is specit will separate every asset or artifact and every process like a command will be a different command which will generate markdown. But when with Gemini tree, Google is using a separate JSON file and this one prompt will identify which step it is within the the the JSON file and then proceed from there. So it makes like it's like a multiflow single prompt. So one prompt will you know will determine what state it is like the it's like a state machine with like different functions and the LLM will decide what to do next based on what you did last. >> Okay. Well, it's like a it's more of a data structure. It's like a link list, right? It's it sets up. >> Yeah. Which is already >> another file, >> right? And and that means that like for example, if you do new track, the…\n\n[slide:3] [12:50–21:52]\nsurprisingly when you do a deep research with GPT you see Reddit Reddit Reddit Reddit Reddit it reads Reddit non-stop. Um and then >> I guess Reddit allows people to crawl it. I mean, I can't help but think that that sits like Red B are probably going to clamp down on all this, but okay. It's interesting, right? Um, but it also means that if you're doing I'm going on a tangent here because when we were talking about forking the Terraform CDK, um, we had to make an announcement. So, I did a chatbt deep research and asked it to look into like the re community reaction towards this this uh, Terraform CDK and and that's where I saw it constantly going through Reddit. So, I was like, if we do anything, we must post the announcement on Reddit because then we know that JGBT is going to surface it. >> Um, and a little also a tangent, since I've switched to Ghosty, uh, the font that uh, Mitchell Hashimoto uses in his config is Jet Brains. So, I now I've switched from uh, I don't know what was I what was I using before? I can't remember the font I was using before. Now, switch to Jet Brains, which is uh, you know, by Jet Brains. And then I noticed the screenshots in the in this blog are from Jet Brain. So they're not using their own Google font. >> Oh, this ones you mean? >> Yeah, that's a Jet Those are Jet Brain. I can I can tell. >> So I thought it was a bit like, oh, if you're Google, you're using Ghosty and Jet Brains like everyone else, are you? You're not using your own Google font. >> Are you using Jet Brains yourself? >> I don't I don't know. So I I don't I just um >> Well, show show me your ghosty config then. >> The ghosty config. >> Yeah, sorry. Going on a tangent here. >> Vim.com config. Gosty config. >> Yeah, I was just in it a while ago. JB brings mono nerd font. Yes. >> Yeah, everyone's using that nowadays, including Google. >> Okay. I can't find which which uh workspace. I think it was on eight. No, where are you? Uhhuh. Here was on three. Yeah. >> Um sorry. Going back to the difference between conductor and spec kit. >> Yeah, I did a short post here like if we look at specit versus conductor. Um so specify is now called a track. The constitution is now split across three artifacts which are focused on the tax stack, the workflow and the product vision. So in spec kit the constitution is purely like um rule of thumb and then it's very heavily enforced if you generate a plan you need to do a validate or an analyze sorry when you run the analyze it…\n\n[slide:4] [21:32–30:36]\nhate me. Um I built this this plan and I wanted to spin up uh agents to do the work. Right. There were again I was at the status where it was identifying open questions and it had to do research and like what React router, what type of uh markdown with React support do I use, um do what kind of plug-in do I use for um vit build process and so on, right? Do I use vit plug-in press or do I use something else? So we had to spin up a bunch of research research tasks and I thought this is a perfect job for agents, right? So I told Opus do the research. I actually didn't even ask Opus to do it with agents. Opus went and go ahead and created a bunch of agents and I was very happy until suddenly. >> But how how did you know that by the way? Because I often find it's not that transparent. How did you know it was spinning up some agents? Oh, because of your your your money went >> money went. So here I need to search I need to start phase zero research. I don't know if you can see it. I'll spawn parallel research agents to investigate. >> Oh, okay. It straight up tells you. Okay, cool. >> And it went broom and then you're out of usage. >> What? >> And you must have been pissed. >> And I was super pissed because literally it was 6 p.m. The the whole budget had just reset. I get a 5hour token budget, right? Starts at 6 p.m. ends at uh 11. Uh oh, no, no, this was before it started. So it resets at 6 p.m., right? So this was before it started. And then I went, \"Oh, great.\" Um, I did some Gemini research here. And the Gemini research was a document of 7,129 tokens. So, it wasn't a big document. So, I fed that user research. And I said, uh, here you go. While you were not available exactly 6 p.m., let's go ahead. I have done my own initial research. And he says, okay, you did really comprehensive research. Let me use it. And I said, no, no, no, no. Go ahead and do your own research. Because I thought like I I didn't trust Gemini, right? I thought Opus is the boss is the goat. Go ahead and look at whatever we already researched and and you know make sure that we made the right choices. So it spun up six research agents and that was all opus launched while they run. I'll also start. So basically seven because the main thread was also consuming tools. >> So it went again >> and then limit reached within 3 minutes. three minutes. It completely exhausted my budget and and unavailable until 11 p.m. >> Have you learned anything after doing the same thing twice? >> Yeah, I've…\n\n[slide:5] [30:15–39:20]\nuse skills. I mean, I use skills. >> I just use the beat skill. >> The bead skill. Okay. I I I'm >> Yeah, but the VS Code skills is is um it seems really I don't know. I didn't like it. It felt like it's a VS Code thing only. Like I don't really care for VS Code things only because I I use >> No, no, no. Just this that's not a VS Code. They're supporting >> Wait, where is it? >> They're supporting a crossplatform thing, which is brilliant in my opinion. >> Pilot skills. >> This one, right? I mean I mean they just announced it. I have yet to try it. I've yet to try. It makes sense because Entropic Oh, so they they're linking directly like you can use the entropic skill because recently when you install when you install latest version of cloud it prompts you and says if you're doing any web development work download our web development skill and now that I say this I'm building this blog and uh I should have in installed the web The the one little bit confusing thing is that the core anthropic skills are basically um what do you call it embedded already if I understand correctly. It's just like the agents thing. So so like I was trying to like read an Excel sheet and and I was like oh I got to install the the skill but then but then I noticed it was already actually there and able to read the >> read Excel sheets. Um, >> you just export, you save as CSV and you give it to the LLM that way. >> Yeah. Well, workday only exports XLX. Workday. Do you have that at at your school? Oh my god, it ruins. >> Uh, school. No. >> Uh, work or something? No. Um, the other thing I wanted to pick you up on is a link that you sent me um about getting going with Speckit. since we're talking about spect. >> Oh, yes. >> And and you called you called him a noob. >> No, I don't do that. I never talked about people that way. What are you talking about? That must have not been me. >> Yeah, you're right. You're right. It couldn't have been you. You're too humble for that. >> I'm I'm very humble and I I I heard that you don't get like um um your proper exposure if you are toxic. So following those old toxic ways. >> Yeah, of course. Shall I share like what I mean? Okay. What what what did he miss out on? I I thought his I I glanced through his guide. I don't know if I can Can I steal the uh the share? Yeah, steal it. I was scrolling through WhatsApp and I didn't see it yet. I didn't think it was a bad one. I just feel like I I I was just prompting you that you have a blog and you you…\n\n[slide:6] [39:00–44:12]\nhad this issue. I have the skills in my project now and I have the speckit always telling it to put tasks in. it really follows a very nice structure of always updating it. With Gemini, I don't know, but it sometimes completely ignores it and sometimes it does a really good good job and I haven't figured out what the difference is like when does it really do a good job. >> Um, yeah, >> I I wanted to mention that I was working with Opus 4.5 yesterday. >> You have to go. >> Oh, there's a truck outside. I don't know what that feels I think they're delivering. >> Go look at the window. We're old now. Now we're making a lot of old people jokes like go look at the window, stand there, the neighbor moved his car and it's not 5:30. What's going on? >> Am I making too many jokes? >> Oh, we get we're getting some stone delivered because one of my Christmas activities is fixing our drive. Okay. Um, I wanted to talk to you about uh cursor. Did we ever talk about cursor? I mean, you don't use cursor. What? Like you you you berate VS Code. So, what do you use to develop and you you just like CLI? >> No, I bade the the agent in VS Code, right? Cuz just now also when we talk about this copilot skills, it's a copilot CLI feature and I don't really care much about copilot. Like I feel why would I go through a router like Copilot to get access to the LLM when I can get it directly from cloud? >> Yeah, I I I I understand that. And but did you ever did you ever play with cuz I just noticed at the end of Adrian's blog did Yeah. Did you ever get back into cursor or you just see that as another expense you can't be bothered? >> You know, I got third place on the cursor hackathon in Ho Chi Min City. One of the requirements was to use cursor. Yeah. >> And how did that how did that go? >> You can't. >> I hope they don't revoke my price. Would that be >> uninstalled? Now you're a sh like I love cursor. Why aren't you using curs? Oh >> well. Anyway, I I already um I forfeited my price because it was $200 split across four people and uh me and my friend we both um >> Wow. $200. That's a lot of money from those big AI. >> $200 trillion companies. Not even real money. It's like, however, they count $200 on their API calls, right? Um, but yeah, um, >> it's like, here's $200 of of your crack cocaine. I mean, >> see you later, buddies. >> There were certain I mean, my my the guy who was…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "The landscape of AI-driven development is shifting from simple code completion to complex, context-aware agents that manage entire workflows. This discussion explores the emergence of tools like Google's Conductor and Microsoft's Spec Kit, which aim to provide structured frameworks for LLMs to operate within. By moving away from raw code generation toward high-level abstractions, developers can guide AI models to produce more consistent, expert-level results. However, this transition introduces new challenges, including significant token consumption during planning phases and the unpredictable behavior of autonomous agents that can quickly exhaust API budgets.\n\n[slide:1]\n## High-level abstractions and AI expertise\nThe conversation begins with the premise that AI models perform significantly better when working with high-level abstractions rather than low-level implementations. Using the Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) as an example, the speakers argue that deterministic abstractions allow AI to avoid \"reinventing the wheel\" for every task. While current AI models are brilliant, they often lack the specific domain expertise required for non-trivial tasks like managing Lambda deployments on Terraform. To bridge this gap, developers are looking toward tools that provide consistent execution through domain-specific guidance.\n*“Abstract deterministic abstractions allow you to work better than reinventing the wheel every time.”*\nThe discussion highlights a talk from Anthropic suggesting that agents today are capable of amazing things when given proper guidance but often lack the necessary context up front. They struggle to absorb human expertise over time, making structured frameworks essential for maintaining consistency across complex projects.\n\n[slide:2]\n## Spec Kit versus Google Conductor\nA major focus is the comparison between Spec Kit and Google's newly announced Conductor. Spec Kit operates by defining a \"constitution\"—a memory file that identifies the core principles and rules for a project. This constitution guides the LLM on how to create plans, subdivide tasks, and prioritize work, such as mandating automated testing or specific formatting rules. In contrast, Conductor introduces a \"track\" system that utilizes a JSON document to manage state.\nWhile Spec Kit separates artifacts and processes into different commands that generate Markdown, Conductor uses a single prompt to identify the current step within a JSON-based state machine. This allows the LLM to decide the next action based on the previous state. Conductor's setup phase is more rigid, requiring the definition of the tech stack, workflow, and product vision before any work can proceed. If these foundational elements are missing, the tool is designed to halt and prompt the user for setup.\n\n[slide:3]\n## The measure twice code once philosophy\nGoogle's Conductor emphasizes a \"measure twice, code once\" approach, which forces the model to complete a comprehensive planning phase before generating any code. This strategy is intended to prevent the model from making false assumptions or hallucinations that lead to \"waterfall\" style failures midway through a project. However, this approach comes with a trade-off: it consumes a large number of tokens during the planning stage without providing immediate output, which can be frustrating for developers accustomed to rapid code generation.\nThe speakers also touch on how LLMs like GPT-4 perform \"deep research\" by constantly crawling platforms like Reddit to gauge community reactions and technical sentiment. This behavior was observed when researching the community's stance on forking the Terraform CDK. The reliance on external sources like Reddit suggests that public announcements on these platforms are increasingly important for influencing the \"knowledge\" that AI models surface to other developers.\n\n[slide:4]\n## The parallel agent budget horror story\nA cautionary tale is shared regarding the use of autonomous agents for research tasks. In one instance, a developer tasked Claude Opus with researching React routers and Vite plugins. Instead of performing the task directly, the model spawned six parallel research agents. Because each agent performed multiple web searches and tool calls, the entire five-hour token budget was exhausted within just three minutes.\n*“We force the model to plan first. That means you're going to use a lot more tokens without any output.”*\nThe developer attempted to recover the findings by adding funds to their account, but the agents failed to return their results due to hitting rate limits. This \"critical bug\" highlights the risks of unconstrained agent autonomy. The solution for many has been to launch tools with a \"no agents\" flag to prevent the model from spawning expensive, parallel processes that can lead to immediate budget exhaustion and service unavailability.\n\n[slide:5]\n## Skills and task management in IDEs\nThe discussion moves to the integration of \"skills\" within development environments. Anthropic has introduced cross-platform skill support, allowing models to use specialized tools for web development or data processing. For example, a model might use a specific skill to read Excel sheets or CSV files directly. There is also a debate about the utility of \"beads\"—a tool for tracking tasks in a SQLite database.\nWhile some developers find beads essential for staying organized when a model fails or a session resets, others find that the AI occasionally ignores the task-tracking instructions. Spec Kit is noted for having better integration with these task-management structures, often forcing the model to update the agent context and project plan consistently. In contrast, Gemini's performance in following these structured instructions is described as hit-or-miss, depending on the complexity of the task.\n\n[slide:6]\n## The death of the CMS and module extension\nThe final segment covers Cursor's controversial claim that developers should never write a Content Management System (CMS) again. Cursor recently migrated their own blog away from a headless CMS (Sanity) to a file-system-based approach using Markdown and React components. The rationale is that LLMs need full access to the code and content to be effective; traditional CMS platforms can act as a silo that prevents the AI from \"seeing\" the data it needs to manipulate.\nSanity provided a mature response, acknowledging that while AI-driven \"vibe coding\" can create early MVPs quickly, professional platforms still offer essential features like version control, access management, and publishing workflows that are difficult to replicate in a simple file system. The conversation concludes with a technical challenge regarding Terraform modules: how to extend the behavior of a centralized module without forking it. While wrapping modules is a common attempt, the speakers suggest that true extension often requires moving toward a full programming language like Pulumi or the CDKTF to handle complex configuration changes."
