    "content": "Transcript:\nYeah. Well, anyway, I thought I should\ndo some housekeeping because I I you\nknow, I got serious. I got I got I went\nwith Claude and I created a a podcast.\n>> So, I wanted to mention that this\npodcast should be available on Apple as\nwell as uh Spotify\nas well as, you know, you don't have to\nsubscribe anywhere. You can just you can\njust go here. But I've only got the MP3\nversion. Oh, I also just wanted to\nmention that uh if you wanted to contact\nme then Henry at uh icky.fe or canry at\nTwitter. I was I was looking at my\nemail. I couldn't actually find an email\naddress for you. You were you were at\nhonest or something like that when I was\nlooking through my email.\n>> What? You don't want to reveal your\nemail address.\nI'm just I was thinking because like the\none that I that's on my commits of my\nmain GitHub profile are it's like a very\nold Gmail that I created when I was like\n12 and I had to take like a name not 12.\nUh when was Gmail?\n>> Yeah, you can't be that young.\n>> 20. Um\nand so it's a it's a silly name. I got\nan Outlook that has my full name.\n>> Oh, for Christ's sake. I mean, and you\nyou're complaining me about using Jurro.\nWell, anyway, Jira, I'm I'm almost\nsurprised that that you don't use Jurro\nat your work. You don't use Jurro.\n[snorts]\n>> And and I think I think it's amazing\nthat like you can use AI to plan to\norganize your spreads. Like like half my\nmy job as a lead is to like chase my\ncolleagues like, \"Oh, have you updated\nyour card? Um, are you using the right\ntemplate? Have you storyointed the card?\nBlah blah blah blah blah.\n>> And and Jura is like molasses. So if I\ncan if I can sync this down to BD and\nget AI to run over it, I'm like I've\nsaved myself 3 hours in.\n>> I think it's a very clever hack. It's\nkind of a realization of the um the\nproblem with MCPS a little bit. Although\nthat your main problem was the latency\nof of managing Jira tickets and then\njust having a local very fast SQL light.\num issue tracker that then automatically\nsyncs to Jira. It's it's a clever hack.\nIt's it's really nice. Um but\nunfortunately it uh it mentions Jira. So\nby that by definition it has to\n[laughter] be\n>> it's just uh hosed. Yeah.\n>> Same same thing. I'm I'm joking with you\nabout Python, right? The moment you\nmention Python or I'm just joking I see\noh no there's Python in this.\n>> Yeah. I mean thank go I feel I feel like\nreally lucky. I feel like I'm living in\na virtual world. Like I love how AI has\ncome along and for Python the UV astral\ntools.\n>> Oh yeah, UV is amazing. UV\n>> it is such I like I wouldn't It's so\ngood. It is so good.\n>> It almost makes Python tolerable.\n>> It almost makes Python tolerable. Yeah.\nAs the whole astral stuff, all the\nAstral stuff is so good.\n>> Are we the baddies?\n[laughter]\nyou know this sketch from um\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Um I can't remember the names. [snorts]\nYeah. UV I actually I'm rolling out\nrough at work. Um hopefully I won't get\ntoo many complaints. I'm replacing It's\namazing because with the rough I'm\nreplacing like like lint black flake 8.\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> Uh\nBandit.\nI'm like replacing the the pre-commit\nhooks used to just take forever. Now\nthey're running like a millisecond. I\nmean, thank you. Thank you. Rough and\nRust and\n>> Oh, Astral. This is all Astral.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n>> Amazing. Amazing. Amazing stuff.\nsounds a bit similar to all of the work\nthat like is happening in the JavaScript\necosystem with like biome replacing\neslint and vitest replacing just um you\nknow making typescript more of a first\nuh class citizen of the of the\necosystem. I know your reaction to\nTypeScript and this is why I reacted to\nabout Python that way was like I hate\nTypeScript but to be honest\n>> to me Typescript is a breath of fresh\nair compared to just plain Java script\nand um Python. I mean\n>> okay um I mean uh\nwell did you ever come across a guy\ncalled uh TJ Holloway Chuck?\n>> No.\n>> No. Oh, TJ. I think his GitHub actions\nare quite popular. No.\n>> Yeah. I mean, he he wrote Okay, this is\na fake account.\n>> Different one.\n>> Uh,\nyeah, that's him. He kind of disappeared\nand all his projects are sort of\nmaintained by other people, but I mean\nhe wrote Express\nback in the day.\n>> Are we talking about Okay.\n>> No, I don't know why it doesn't show up\nin his repos anymore. Oh, I think it's\nnow like uh\n>> in the foundation or an orc.\n>> Yeah, something like that. But like I I\noften I mean I often sounds like I'm\ninsane, but like you know sometimes I\nget nostalgic and look at his old code\nand uh I don't think it's been\nTypescript.\nI mean it's it's like it's free of all\nthat sort of stupid annotations unless\nsomeone's uh changed it. But like I\nthought that the way I mean what I'm\ntrying to say is that I learn to write\nto write node from his code\nand every time I read his code I just\nthink it's so nice so nice this code\nand express is also one of those one of\nthose projects which which I thought was\nsomething that dragged me back into the\nNode.js world for good reasons. But like\nyeah, I mean Express is s such an\namazing project. I guess everything's\nstill kind of Expressbased, right?\n>> Mhm.\n>> I think you align with with um one of\nlike you know DHH.\n>> Yeah, DHH. Yeah. Yeah. I\nhe he's uh he's cool. He's cool. He he\nlaunched phys he launched Fizzy, which I\nthought was like kind of weird because\nyou've been talking to me about Bead's\nUIs.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. That's that's funny. I also\nsaw him mention about like issue\ntrackers. Um but in terms of his school,\nI I also I don't agree. I had this very\ndeep conversation with Chad GPT about\nattaching politics to technical\num work. For example, DHH he does\namazing projects. I don't like Ruby on\nRails, but I do like um Omari or Omari\nand I like Omar before that. And um\n>> you're not running that software. You\njust like the idea, don't you?\n>> No, no. I run I run it on my uh Windows\ndesktop and I also for new year bought a\none terabyte SSD NVME to install RP and\nall the way.\n>> That's funny cuz I bought something\nsimilar. What did you buy? Did you buy\nexactly the same one I bought?\n>> EVO Plus. I think I didn't pay break the\nbank. What is this?\n>> Yeah, I went I bought a Crucial.\n[sighs and snorts]\n>> The Samsung ones are like more\nexpensive. it. Well,\nit was a really good salesman\n[laughter] because I go to this shop in\nVietnam and Samsung is quite a popular\nrange of products in Vietnam. And in\nVietnam, you you must have you must have\na brand or quality, right? And so some\nshops, they are the official retailers.\n>> There's no returns policy. You just go\nbuy.\n>> No,\nthere is return policy actually with\nFungu. They they open the package\nnormally and they put a little warranty\nsticker but they didn't do it on this\none which is normally when you buy it\nthey put like a little sticker and they\nlike tag which but I guess today you can\ndo it with the receipt but um back in\nlike 2006 when I came to Vietnam and you\nwent you bought anything it all needed\nto be tested right in the store right\nyou don't buy anything you don't take\nanything home until you have actually\ntested it in the store and there's a\nlittle sticker added straight on the\nhardware\n>> that's cool yeah well I I I always\nremember buying light bulbs at the at\nthe hardware store in Singapore. They\nall the the lady always tested the light\nbulb before she um you know let me leave\nthe store and I'm like they would never\ndo this in England.\n>> I think this is a thing in Asia um\nbecause of like cheap knockoffs, right?\nUm and so you want to get the quality.\n>> So so with this shop where I bought it,\nyou said Samsung is the more expensive\none. probably be related to their like\num guarantees on on uh on and return\npolicies and also I've been thinking\nabout like installing Omari I use Omar\ncoup right now Ubuntu based with Gnome\nright and um I'm having some display\nissues sometimes with with Ubuntu but it\nworks great but lately I've done all my\nwork on my Mac OS but I want to go back\nto like um Linux and and so they\ncompletely pivoted to Omari so I've been\nwanting to get a new SSD drive to\ninstall it um since June because my old\nSSDs are too small as well. So when I\nwas there, I bought a router because I\nwanted to set some other like separate\nnetwork up in my house. And I was there\nand I asked him like we I saw the price\nof a desktop like a pre-made and he\nbasically told me one of the\nsalespersons there was like, \"Oh, you\ncan buy all of these components and\nbuild it for half the price. Don't buy\nthis like pre-made.\"\n>> Oh, wins when's the trust.\n>> Like Yeah, you're right. You're right.\nWhat else? What? Tell me about\n>> I just bought I just went in for a VPN\nrout um sorry a router that has VPN\nsupport and um and then I he for some\nreason I I was looking at the desktop.\nThey have these gaming desktops on on\ndisplay, right? And he made that comment\nand I was like, \"Yeah, but like memory\nand GPU right now is crazy, right?\" And\nhe's like, \"Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.\" And\nthen I was like, \"I've been wanting to\nbuy an SSD.\" And he was like, \"Oh, the\nprice is going to go up.\"\n>> And I'm like, \"What? I know memory and\nGPU is going to go up, but what about\nabout like hard hard disks? And he was\nlike, \"No, no, because in Vietnam, China\nis buying all of this. They're buying\nall the memory. They're buying all the\nGP GPU from all the neighboring\ncountries.\"\n>> Yeah. Yeah. And and because they're\nbuilding AI rigs and and so they are\n>> sense of urgency is created and the\nbuyer\n>> he immediately created the sense of\nurgency and I was like, \"Yeah, I've been\nthinking about it for for six months.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Yeah, but I haven't\nused my Ubuntu for a while.\" So I was\nlike, \"Ah, there's no urgency for me\nthere, right?\" And he was like, \"No, no,\nno. It's going to go up.\" And I was\nlike, \"Oh, okay then, [laughter]\nyou know,\n>> last well.\"\n>> And then when I check out, he looks at\nthe bill and I said, and and I'm like,\n\"Yeah, it's a bit expensive, but it's\nlike Christmas, right?\" And he's like,\n\"Yeah, but that's like half my salary.\nThat's half my monthly salary.\" And\n[laughter] I was like,\n>> \"Dude, I think you was asking for a tip.\n>> Do do you tip people in in Vietnam?\" No.\nNot in that shop, but it used to be a\nvery like uh\n>> depends if it's a bar and good someone's\ngood-looking, I suppose. Maybe.\n[laughter]\n>> Cool. Well, places. I don't know what\nyou're talking about. [laughter]\n[snorts]\n>> Well, let's see. Let me think.\nOh, okay. Let me just rattle off some\nthoughts.\nAre you using Ghosty?\nNo, but I heard that Ghosty fixes the\nscroll bug in cloud code, so I'm\nthinking about it.\n>> I switched to Ghosty and I'm loving it\nactually.\n>> Mhm.\n>> And this is Ghosty right here. Okay. Um,\ncan you see my whole screen? You can see\nit. You can see this.\n>> Yeah. And I see your duffel API key. And\nNo, I'm just kidding. [laughter]\n>> Yo, don't think I need this keybind. I'm\njust taking it off.\nYeah, I'm loving Ghosty. It's It's fast.\nUm,\n>> want to give it background like it's\nHashimoto.\n>> Oh yeah, you can project after exiting.\n>> I don't go for that whole like what do\nyou call it?\n>> Um,\n>> it's written in Zigg or Rust. Zigg,\nright?\n>> Yeah, it's fast\nand like it does like weird things which\nis I think is quite cool. Like when it\nseems to know that like it's waiting\nsometimes. I don't know how this is\nexpressed in tone language,\n>> but I'm I'm I'm loving it. I'm loving\nit. This uh and uh and Claude I I'm I'm\noften like I'm still a little bit\nconfused how to init my like how do you\ninit your project? I go get initi\nand and and then and then but then it's\nstill but then I still have to do\nsomething like um\nlike like this, right? before any is is\nthat how you set up beats or do you do\nsomething else?\n>> I have not set up beats in a new\nproject. I'm working in a fairly large\nmonor repo right now. So I just\nfine-tune whatever is there and um\n>> but what you just showed seemed to be\nlike the nice way of doing it.\n>> You still have a performance issue.\n>> Yeah, there's still a performance issue.\nI'm not too sure why. You mentioned that\nthat the demon runs or something.\nYeah. So I was on beats version 0.21 or\nsomething and there was some demon\nsocket issue or maybe in later versions\nthere was a demon socket issue. I\ndefinitely saw some um issues about\nperformance in in the GitHub repo and\npeople were saying it's a leftover demon\nsocket\n>> that need to be killed. So if you kill\nall the demons usually it solves the\nproblem.\n>> Okay, maybe you're right. I just killed\nthem all and now it's faster. [laughter]\n>> Yay.\nOkay, that's one problem solved.\n>> That's one problem with beads though,\nlike there's a new release every two\ndays. [laughter]\nUh there's a a slew of duplicate like um\ncommands because it's all AI generated.\nSo there's no consistency and it\nreintroduces bugs all the time or it\ncreates completely new bugs and then you\nget like\n>> I think I think Steve is definitely like\nnot coding. You know what I mean?\n>> Oh crap. Oh, sorry. What? [laughter]\n>> He doesn't seem to be coding. Oh yeah,\nyou showed me that pull request. Uh,\nwhich one was it?\n>> The the what was it about the ali cats\nlooking for work in the graveyard?\nAnd um it's the pole I think it's it's\nhis test. It's it's like pole cat.\nSearch for pole cat. It's not graveyard.\nIt's like junkyard.\n>> So I can't find it.\n>> Yeah, he he has some very interesting\ncommits. But um what worries me when I\nwant to update this this thing this\nbinary is that I see commits like fix uh\nfile corruption issue and all this stuff\nand I'm like wait what they have like\nfile corruption issues at\n>> point I I've had some weird merge issues\nbut I mean but but since I know that\nlike you know [snorts] since I know that\nthe source of truth is is uh this file\nhere.\nLet me go BD crate foo bar whatever.\nYeah, since I know since I know how it\nworks kind of\nuh I can go in here and fix things. But\nI'm just surprised it happens. Like I'm\nreally really surprised it happens. But\nanyway, whatever. A great find for me\nwhen I wanted to update Beats was um I\nwent through any of the UI projects that\nare going on and just a few days ago\nsomebody um created a TUI a terminal UI\nfor beats called\n>> Oh yeah, which one? Yeah, you which one\nis that?\n>> P E R L E S. It's in the root read me\nalso.\n>> P E R L E S. Well, yeah, if you go to\nthe read me. Yeah, pearls but the French\nway. Pearl. Yeah. At pearl the pear.\nBelush.\n>> It sounds dirty. Honestly,\n>> what I said was pearls for the swines.\n[laughter]\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, this one, download it, dude. Try it\nout.\n>> Oh, I thought it was a web thing.\n>> No. So I I've been using Beats UI but\nBets UI doesn't show comments on issues\nand it doesn't show uh it doesn't allow\neasy tree navigation from one issue to\nthe other and and the dependencies.\n>> It doesn't show\num\nwhat was it there was some other issues\nthat I had ah it doesn't allow me to\nfilter by labels. So, so this thing is\nif you like Jira, this seems to be the\nJira for beats. Okay, because one of the\nthings you can do is Jira is you can\nbuild your combon boards with your\ncolumns and you can doing some query\nlanguage there, right? Not that I ever\nuse Jira or or you know care about Jira,\nbut somebody told me that you can do\nthese query language um for your columns\nand your boards and your views and all\nthat, right? So, they have this BQL\nbeatsql and it's like a lexer with a\nparser. Yeah, this is a little bit\nunsettling that things have gone towards\nJura so quickly [laughter]\nlike beats it was so simple now now the\npeople are doing this\n>> but the good thing is this is all\nseparate from beats yeah you can get\nthis if you want so I I used his like\nkbon view but you can't like cross\nreference columns like if you create one\ncolumn with something and then you want\nanother column to to use something from\nthat you can't do that so if you want to\nbuild a tree of dependencies or you want\nto navigate and and he didn't seem seem\nto like have a very deeply nested uh\nbeats issue. Maybe I can show you how it\nlooks on my on my machine.\n>> The the next thing I couldn't help but\nthink is like estimation points,\nvelocity,\n>> you can see the screen.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh. Oh, how did that get up there?\n>> Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, I mean, yeah, if\nyou want to spend some time talking\nabout grid.\n>> Um, no tangent here. So,\nthat's a bit of uh crap here, but let's\nlet's maximize this view. You got to be\nable to maximize.\n>> So, here we are. Uh\n>> maybe maybe control plus a bit. I mean,\nno one's going to be able to read this\non YouTube otherwise.\n>> Oh, that's going to that's not going to\nlook good, is it?\n>> I'm going to have to control minuses a\nbit. Is that acceptable?\n>> Okay. I guess you're just showing the\naesthetics, I suppose.\n>> Yeah. So\nthis is the standard view of per\nuh if you want to pronounce it the\nFrench way and you see there's like the\nblocked the ready um the in progress and\nthe closed issues right classic I added\nanother view which is just showing the\nepics\n>> and then from an epic\n>> I go into the epic and I can see the\nfull progress of this epic so I have\nlike 57 beats tasks in this epic and I\nwish I could like narrow this column So\nthere those little symbols at the end\nmean that like the agent is is choing\ndown on it or what does it mean?\n>> Yeah. So the little check marks if you\nsee them are completed tasks and then\nthe green ones green like circles are\nthis is not yet um implemented. Actually\nthese it should be nice if there's like\nred for for blocked and and green for\nready to to pick up. Maybe that's\nsomething that we could uh request. And\nthen here we have uh the blue one here\nthe full full blue circle. You can see\nthat one is in progress, right? So, so\nyou can navigate the full dependency\ntree and\n>> when earlier the reason why I bring this\nup is because most people don't really\nhave this like deep nested uh list. I\nthink I mean if I look at my\n>> I mean at work I'm often on a jura board\nwith epic features tasks and it's it's a\nnightmare just to to go between them. I\nmean I mean there is this like chicklet\nthing but like you know how Jurro is so\nslow just just the fact that just the\nfact that you're moving between issues\nin a tree like that just\nmakes me feel unusual.\n[snorts]\n>> Don't talk about Jira. We don't talk\nabout Jira.\nSo for me like this was my main uh view\nthat I used of this beats UI which was\nlike the epics view and then when I\nwanted to look I could see like the the\nphases of each of the user stories uh\nfor this epic. So I'm working on um\nterraform state delete uh with like soft\ndelete tombstones and and then terapform\nstate rename functionality and so maybe\nagain this is an epic it should have\nbeen scoped down I don't know but um\nthis is the things I'm missing. So for\nexample, there's a user story here. When\nI click on it, I can see all of its\ndependencies. Ah, there's another thing.\nThere are design and notes here and\neverything. And then when I look at the\ndependencies,\n>> you can I have this little graph view,\nbut it's I can't click on anything and\nand it's it's not really nice.\n>> So this is where\n>> ditch that project and move to the\nterminal.\n>> Yeah. Um I I was like I was doing pull\nrequest to add the tree view but then he\nadded his own version and it was\n>> how come the issue names have like quite\nweird naming like I I thought it was\njust like now now you have AS3 3.4.12\n4.12 what?\n>> Yes. Um I noticed beats does that when\nyou create a new task that is that has a\nparent. So it will just append.1 point\ntwo parent.\n>> I I don't know because I also\n>> How come I haven't noticed that?\n>> This is after I upgraded it started\ndoing that.\n>> I see. Okay. Right.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what happens if you move a task to\nanother feature or something or or epic?\nThen it might mess up a bit. But anyway,\n>> move task. Tasks are not open long\nenough to move things around, bro.\n>> Yay.\n>> Right now, I created this whole tree\nyesterday with Opus 4 and I've completed\n50% of it. Um, this morning, okay, so\nthat was we talked a little bit about\nlike beats issue management and your uh\nsynchronization. There's quite a few\nchanges in in AI land as well like cloud\njust released something called resumable\nagents. So if you prompt cloud and tell\nit to send the agent to the background\nthen that agent becomes resumable which\nis like a very early way of um you know\nbefore when you when you say like hey\nspawn three sub agents to do a task they\nspawn they complete and then you know\nthey're dead.\n>> So it sounds like you can get the\ncontext back if you wanted to pick it\nup.\n>> That's that seems to be the goal. um it\nwas on Reddit and people were saying\nabout this\n>> because in my mind BD is the is the key\nbecause it keeps the context in a task\nright in a in a in an issue.\n>> Yeah. So if I\n>> if and I'm just like paranoid nowadays\nof using since I've been using AI so\nlong like I just don't want context to\nbe anywhere else almost except in that\ntask.\n>> Exactly. So so if we look at this task\nhere like this is a very detailed task\nright. It shows what we are trying to do\nthe goal. Then there's the acceptance\ncriteria of like we need to actually is\na mistake here. I should have design\nfirst and then acceptance criteria.\n>> Okay. Don't beat yourself up about it.\nYeah. Progressive disclosure.\n>> Yes. Um I don't like this. Um I'm I'm\ngoing to do a PR to fix this. This is my\nPR originally. He already merged it. U\nbut I I I realized it later that it was\nwrong. So anyway, um, and then the most\nimportant thing is that I want to be\nable like you just said, spawn an agent\nfrom this task or maybe from a user\nstory so that they can complete because\nthese tasks are very detailed. The most\nimportant thing is it tells exactly\nwhich file to change, right? Which is so\ncrucial um, if you want to spin up\nagents like Haiku and they don't need to\nlike explore the whole codebase, just\nkeep them focused on a little sub part.\nDefinitely if you're working on like a\nmonor repo type of thing. Yeah, I mean\nto be honest, I do that with my\ncolleagues. I say these are the in the\nin the scope section of the of a ticket.\nI say these are the the files that\nyou're going to change. You're not going\nto go anywhere else,\n>> right?\n>> I do this already with my colleagues.\n>> So, so, so, so agents with this should\nwork perfectly, right? You give them a\nsmall task, they complete it like how\nyou code completes it and then the\noverall main thread of your cloud code\nthe context is saved because it doesn't\nneed to read the whole file iterate on\nmaking the changes and then you know\nthat main context stays clean and and\nfocused on what is the overall goal and\njust coordinates the sub agents. So I\ntried earlier to say like okay there's\nsome of these tasks they are ready and\nthey can be done in parallel and spawn\ntwo agents to do it but I wanted the\nagents to confirm to me first that they\nwere doing the right thing. So I told in\nthe prompt that you sent to the agent\nmake sure to ask it to check in early\nand it came back to me um with a\ncheck-in and then I and it was like it\nasked like a lot of questions I hadn't\neven thought about and\n>> it's amazing. So it's kind of mirroring\nmy life. So basically it's it's doing a\nkickoff. It's basically asking any\nclarifying questions, right? We call\nthis a kickoff. And uh\n>> yeah. And um and then what happened is I\nsaid, \"Okay, great cloud. I heard you\nhave this resume capability. Now resume\nthose agents um but there's a bug. So\nthey don't see their initial prompt. So\nmake sure to reiterate your original\ninitial prompt and then together with\nyour um um approval of their plan and\nthen it send kick off an agent and they\ncompleted a task. But then later I asked\nit, \"Hey Cloud, do you have agent IDs?\nDo you know how to resume agents?\" And\nit was like, \"No, there are no agent\nIDs.\" No, I cannot resume. I was like,\n\"Oh, okay. So what just happened?\" Like\n>> that's really interesting. So things are\nthings are evolving quite quickly. I I\nlistened to an anthropic uh video last\nnight and\nthe emphasis with with respect to agents\nwas skills. So, I'm wondering to myself,\nhave you adopted that workflow where\nyour agents are you attach skills to\nyour agents? I believe like do you ever\ndo that\n>> I I think we saw the same YouTube about\ndon't build um don't build agents but\nbuild skills, right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah, that one. Oh, man. We're\nwe're in an echo chamber here. We're\nlike reading the same things.\n>> I saw it on on Reddit. Um, and I haven't\nbeen able to watch it because like I\nsaid, my audio is not working right now.\nI don't know.\n>> It's nothing. It's nothing too amazing\nto be honest. It was a bit is a bit\ntame, but like\n>> Yeah. So, I do have the agent skill\nhere.\n>> I mean, I have the beat skill here cuz I\ntold you how crucial the beat skill was,\nright? It It really made it really gave\nCloud the edge compared to other\n>> You haven't written your own skills yet?\n>> No. No. Nothing else. I'm also still I'm\nstill struggling to maybe I've just\nforgotten how to do it, but like like\nlike how do you like package manage\nskills? Like how do you like just bring\nskill into a project? Like like how do\nyou like isn't there like a cuz you get\nplugins but they're not the same as\nskills. So I'm a little bit confused\nlike I I want to like add Vincent's\nskill repository and get XY Z skill or\nreference that skill inside the the\nagent or something.\nUh\n>> so this is somebody that I know on\nLinkedIn. He he built some TypeScript\nproject but he wasn't at at Meta. He he\nwas asking the question how do we\npackage like create bundles to easily\ndeploy um what you said like these\ncapability like plugins are MCPs skills\nagents what how do we build these and\nand and have them\n>> like bootstrapped into into agent\nshells? Um, and then he posted on\nhackernews something called source\nwizard. Um, which is I think a project\ntrying to do this, but it has the same\nquestion as what you just asked, right?\n>> Like how do we create bug?\n>> I'm sure I'm sure Anthropic is working\non it. Like the a previous project that\nI used to be quite into was called GBT\nscript. Have you heard of that one?\n>> Let me share my script.\n>> Gib script. Um, hold on. I need to\nYou sound like eggshell from M MRC.\n>> Eggshell.\n>> Was it XL? The thing that you use for\nscripting bots on Mr. C.\n>> Um Oh, yeah. I Yeah.\nIROC. That brings me back\ntunnels bounce. I'm actually still on\nIRC. I don't know if you're on free node\nand all that sort of stuff. There is a\nrelevant QRDC comic. What's it called?\nXKDC. X KDC comic. XKCD.\n>> So I'm I'm a lot of this stuff is is\nprior R in a way like GBT script done by\nthe same guy behind Rancher Labs. Uh\nDarren uh can't remember his name.\n>> Wow. I didn't know he was doing other\nstuff cuz I used to follow him on\nTwitter.\n>> Yeah, he's he's great on Twitter. I\nbuild the cloud. So One thing about GBTS\nscript is that\nthey have this concept of of yeah tools.\nSo you have different tools and you can\nthese these in my opinion are are agents\nreally.\n>> You can you yeah you can have tools and\nthey do certain things. So you reference\nthem in your like your front matter like\nI want the random number tool. I mean\nthese are skills right and and then he\nand then they they can be packaged at\nthe end of a URL. I mean, so what I'm\ntrying to say is that I'm sure Anthropic\nare just going to like do do something\nvery similar.\n>> Yeah. MCP was kind of the goal of like\nhaving a redistributable and they put in\nthe plug-in marketplace and they're\ndefinitely going to make bundles.\n>> Yeah, they're definitely going to do\nthis. It's it's it's I guess it's\n>> and hooks.\n>> Do you know Beats now installs a hook if\nyou do Beats Doctor?\nYeah, I'm not too sure. I thought that\nwas a reason why my things were getting\nslow, but what is\n>> I don't like the hook.\n>> Yeah, like it makes Yeah, I I want to be\n>> I don't know. I'm I'm partial on it\nbecause I'm like I keep staging my work\nand then my commits are huge and the\nhook is like telling it complete the\ntask and then, you know, do the commit.\nAnd I am very reluctant to let the LLM\ncommit. I'm like heavily in the loop\nlike I want to commit to work. I I\nnoticed a tweet from you or something on\nLinkedIn about [clears throat]\nmissing a file. I honestly had the\nexperience where\nI don't know how it happened, but the\nfile I was working on got nuked while an\nagent was running in the same repo. So,\nI mean, I'm mature enough. I'm old\nenough not to delete my own files\naccidentally. So, I'm like, how did\n>> we ever old enough not to delete our own\nfiles? I just did like an hour ago.\nSo, I looked into git stash. There was\nno git stash because I would I would\nassume that the AI would be smart enough\nto stash it if if they didn't understand\nwhy why my file was hanging around and\nit wasn't there. And and and I was like\nquite\nshocked about it. But but then I\nremembered that VS Code has this local\nfile history feature.\n>> Yes, I was about to say it's amazing.\n>> And I and I managed to pick out a an old\ncopy of the file I was working. I was\nlike,\n>> \"Visual Studio Code cache is a lifesaver\nif you accidentally.\"\n>> Thank you, Visual Studio Code. Thank\nyou.\n>> It's it's if you don't know about it,\nit's it's such a surprise and it happens\nsometimes, but I I keep forgetting some\nbut it happens where you accidentally\nremove or or you want to get back to an\nolder version of a certain file and\ncache and the cache has it.\n>> So, it's really uh\n>> lifesaver. Yeah.\n>> Team VS Code. Um sadly, but truly. Hey,\nMicrosoft.\n>> So, I um yeah, so I did I was going to\nmention I didn't use I just used Beads\nand Claude to to basically roll out this\nfeature and I thought it went quite well\nand and there's there's a lot to it like\num\nlike for example, do you know about uh\nredo?\nRedo\nor just redo?\nNo, I don't. No, we do.\n>> It's kind of like a very niche uh well\nniche. It's just like an unknown make\nreplacement.\nAnd to my surprise, I didn't even like\ninstruct the AI about it. It just knew\nwhat to do. It just did it.\nSo,\n>> like it tried to see if it was on the\npath and then start using it.\n>> Well, I told it to use red do, but it it\nknows how to write the language.\nAh\n>> and and uh I I just wanted to mention\nthat like while I was developing that\npodcast uh cache that it wrote all these\nredo files like perfectly. it understood\nthe principles because the the principle\nof redo is that it's like make you have\na target\n>> and the way that you use standard out\nand standard error um sort of\ncontributes to how the that particular\nthing gets created like it has this\nconcept of different uh named uh I don't\nknow what you call these things\n>> arguments positional arguments\n[snorts]\n>> so\nso basically when it um yeah it. And the\ncool thing about redo is is unlike make\nwhich is no one can ever write a script\ninside make because of the weird\nescaping that you have to make. You just\nwrite it in shell.\n>> But with the with these paradigms of\nusing these name things, then you\nreplicate the whole make target type\nstuff. So if you want to if if you're\nmissing uh you know fubar.mpp3,\nit knows exactly how to make it.\n>> Okay.\nYeah, I was I was I was impressed that\nit was able just to go go with it. And\nuh so I didn't use uh I didn't use\nspecit. I just basically said I want\nthis this this and this that done and it\ndid it. And I was like wow\n>> do I need I still need to learn specit.\n>> So somebody on on on Reddit was like\nwhat is your guys what is your workflow?\nAnd his workflow was like I use cloud\nyou know client like the the desktop\ncloud code not cloud CLI the the cloud\nuh client desktop\n>> desktop client sheesh I can't speak he\nuses that and then he just um you know\ngets the prompts to put them into cloud\ncode and then basically copy paste\nbetween them and that's how I started\nwith chatgbt right and that's where I I\nI I said like speckit is\n>> yeah that's true like there's different\nlike levels of maturities\nAnd most like 99% of my colleagues are\nstill sit in chat GBT UI type thing.\nYeah.\n>> Which is fine. Like I like what my reply\nbasically to him was like for my large\nproject I use the spec kit flows because\nit kind of um removes all of that copy\npaste and it helps me like I showed you\nthe task. They're very like limited\n[clears throat] to exactly what you need\nto change where. So, we got this grand\ndesign like with Opus. It's like a big\nto-do list, but instead you can break it\ndown into small little cloud sessions\nthat are focused on the individual\nfiles.\n>> If you have Yeah.\n>> If you have a really big project, you\ncan go to that level, but like it takes\na day to do that. Like I said, it I used\nto tell you like it's like 60% of the\ntime I'm doing this and then I was\nsaying 70% of the remaining time, which\nis of course.\n>> Yeah. So, like I think the way I\nprompted it was like I think I started\nwith an epic\num or maybe two epics. And yeah, I guess\nthe beautiful thing here is that we can\nlook I don't know if you checked in your\nyourjson\nL, but like I guess one thing we can\nlook forward to doing in the future is\nlike is like seeing which you know going\nthrough the tasks and seeing which ones\ngot completed well and then and then\nmaybe studying studying the description\nto see, you know, what's working and\nwhat's not working, you know, like\nthis is not very this is not very\nreadable, but I was I was hoping that\nyou and I could just say or you could\nsay, \"Kai, you're a genius for\nprompting.\"\n>> Uh,\n>> so what I was I I had the thought today\nthat I I should try this, I should try\nthat because I'm trying to fix this sub\nagent problem and every time I try it,\nit like spawn an agent and then no 50/50\ncoin toss, maybe it does the thing I\nwant and then it uses all my tokens and\nthen I'm not happy. Um, so, so yes, I\nwant to spend more time on that, but I\nalso want to just complete the task.\nLike I just had Opus generate all the\ntasks and I was like, now it should be\nfine to let Gemini do everything and it\nsave all of my clock.\n>> That resonates a lot with me because I I\nmean that's my\n>> I don't do it\n>> because I'm going to waste because\nGemini is going to give me something and\nmaybe some of it works, maybe some of it\ndoesn't and I don't trust it. So I'm\nlike right now I'm not going to do that.\nSo, it's you need to find like if you\nwant to do this, you need to dedicate a\nbudget to it because it's going to cost\nmoney. You need to budget dedicate time\nand you need to build your benchmarks\nand your evolves and you need to do it\nproperly.\n>> It's it's a whole job. And\n>> I was I was going to say that like you\nlike half of me wants to get the thing\ndone and then half of me wants to to to\nto do a retro to to see what worked and\nwhat didn't work. to to make sure that\nlike I have that feeling that I learned\nsomething because because yeah I mean\n>> I want I want to build and I want to\nlearn from the build all the time\n>> because I'm very religiously asking the\nevery time that a task was not correct I\nask it to record the problems as\ncomments on the task. So supposedly the\nJSONL that I have should clearly\nindicate that uh here we had a\ndivergence here we have a divergence and\nit should clearly highlight the problems\nbut there's so many dimensions in terms\nof like the overall scope of the project\nlike why diverge\n>> it's very hard um to so so my approach\ntoday is I try it I give it a good go\nhow far how much com how comfortable I\nam in terms of time and in terms of\nrectifying the output\nI don't want to throw away the work. I\nthink the right way would be to just\nlike, oh, I throw away a lot of that\nwork and I start again. Um, so I don't I\ndon't do that right now. And so,\n>> yeah, I'm I'm Yeah, I that whole\nthrowaway thing doesn't make sense to\nme. Like I'm I'm always just picking up\nthe pieces. Oh, did you see my my blog\nabout Sorry to change the topic. AI\nannoyances. I don't know if any of these\nresonated with you\n>> before before we go there because you\nasked about the workflows and I\nmentioned about the Reddit comment about\nthe copy pasting and then using spec\nkit. What I wanted to say was at the end\nof my comment I realized that actually a\nlot of the time I'm just asking Gemini\ntree and I have to like say I constantly\nflip-flop between them. But today I have\ncloud code as my main like big project\nworkhorse and then I have Gemini tree\nfor I don't care what you do. this is\nthe problem I see, fix it. And it just\ngoes and does, you know, goes off and\nthen I check in. Sometimes I do the make\ntest. I do the make build and if it\nworks, I'm happy. I don't care about the\ncode because that was basically my\nconclusion. Um, and then like I don't\nknow if that makes sense. So you don't\nlet me just write this down. So\nbasically right now you're using using\nClaude I don't know son 4.5 whatever,\nright? or you're using Opus whatever\nyou're just using claw code\n>> and then what and then I I didn't quite\nunderstand how you you throw it over to\nGemini Gemini 3 pro pro right yeah so on\nthe project that I'm currently using\ncloud code I wanted to use Gemini but I\ndecided not to and I have like three\nother repos that I'm doing at the same\ntime so on one side I'm adding an API\nnew functionality on the other side I\nhave a completely separate repository\nand binary that consumes the SDK Okay,\nI'm I'm saying like hey uh we need to\nstart doing this and that and then I ask\nthat Gemini and I don't do speckit. I\ndon't do anything. It's like I don't\ncare about that project.\n>> So but I'm I'm just what do you ask\nGemini to just to review the task? I\ndon't quite understand what\n>> no complete separate. So one one\nrepository I use cloud code opus 4.5\ncreate and specit broken down by tasks\nand it's a large monor repo across many\nfiles. uh and and and I the goal is to\nhave Son or Gemini 3 do the actual\nimplementation but today I and I find it\nvery silly because Sun 4.5 and Gemini 3\nto me are no different. So I I should be\nable to trust Gemini 3 for that project\nbut I don't and I do trust Gemini\neverywhere else like no specitate\nnothing Gemini you're more you're more\nlike leaning into into Gemini\n>> more and more now.\nbecause of the heavy limits on on on\ncloud like\n>> oh that's why\n>> yeah mainly\n>> but I still don't understand your\nworkflow so you you do the thing in with\nclaw code in this repo I then when you\ndo how do you do this handover when do\nyou throw things over to Gemini\n>> on the on the right box where you have\nGemini add slash um entropic or slash\nson\n>> oh okay\nokay\nSo\nyeah, so how do I do the handover? Opus\ncreates all of the beats I choose. As\nyou saw, I have a huge dependency tree\nof how they link to each other. Every\nsingle\n>> it's is broken down in one epic that has\nmultiple phases which are the features\nand then within the feature there's like\nactual task. So the epic and the feature\nthey have just general description but\neach individual task has a design\nsection which says like what we are\ndoing um sorry the description is what\nwe are doing the design is how we are\ndoing it and the acceptance criteria is\nwhat we want to verify right then maybe\nsome notes and then definitely using\nusing comments for any divergence while\nyou do the work\nyeah so it's description design\n>> no oh sorry description I think\ndescription is what?\n>> Oh yeah. Why? What? And why?\n>> Yeah. [snorts]\n>> How?\n>> And then acceptance criteria.\n>> Yeah. But okay. So\n>> what Opus creates and and ultimately\nwhat needs to be closed are the tasks\nthat contain those sections. So that's\nthe context for\n4.5.\n>> So you Okay. So you get the card and\nthen and then you throw it on here.\nOkay. Can I just replay how I think what\nyou're telling me? You you have a a\nplanning repository and then you use BD\nto coordinate uh your tasks.\n>> I have a mono rep. So it's it's all in\nthe same repository.\n>> Oh okay. It's all in the same\n>> when I talked about different repos. I'm\ntalking about different task completely\nnot shared beats task.\n>> Okay.\nSo I you're just using Gemini just\nbecause it's it's cheap, right? And it's\ngot and it's got more context, doesn't\nit?\n>> Yeah. Um and\nit's smart. It's like almost opus smart,\nright? But I'm afraid it doesn't follow\nthe instructions.\nI don't know why. It's it's ridiculous.\nit just because like I felt like I want\nto get this done and I don't want to\ntake like exactly what we earlier you as\nlike can we do some benchmark and some\nevals and some some figuring out things\nI was like yes I want to do that but I\nwant to get this thing done like now\nit's Tuesday and I want to get it done\nby tomorrow so I'm like I'm not just\ndoing\n>> there's been so many like weird little\ninstances where I feel AI\nwas just immature or not listening to me\nor did its own thing. It's It's\nhilarious. It's kind of It's\n>> the thing about Gemini. Gemini is very\nliteral. So, I'm afraid that if I\nhaven't if I have made a mistake in the\ndescription of design or a capsson\ncriteria, I'm afraid Gemini will just\nnot do it right. And I feel that Son is\ndoing more of what I expected to do.\n>> Yeah. Interesting.\n>> So, when I care about it, I ask Son. If\nI don't care about it, I ask Gemini.\nLike, I don't care how, just make it\nwork.\nOkay, I got to I got to do my kids drop\noff now.\nUm, so\n>> cuz you wanted to talk about AI\nannoyances, but then\n>> Yeah. Did you read this blog? Did I\nshare it with you?\n>> I don't think you did.\n>> Have a look. I don't know if you're\ngoing to be around. I'm going to I have\nto do my kids drop off and then uh then\nmaybe we can resume.\nHopefully I have a chill morning.\n>> My budget doesn't reset for another\nhour. [laughter] So, I'm watching you\nYouTube. I went to the gym. So, this was\npart of my my comment reply because\npeople are always complaining about\nlike, oh, these limits are horrible. I'm\ncurrently not unhappy. I do not feel\nthere's a huge degradation in the amount\nof work I can get done. Actually, I feel\nlike I get more done with the current\ncost and limits on my on my account and\n>> constraints are good. Constraints are\ngood.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, so I ended it a bit snarky\nwith like and if I if I hit a limit, I\ntouch your ass and you should do\n[laughter] the same.\nWell, I'm I'm Yeah.\n>> Easy said when you're frustrated, right?\n>> Okay. Um Yeah. May maybe resume in uh 20\nminutes. See you.\n>> Okay. See you.",

    "transcriptTimedText": "[0:00] Yeah. Well, anyway, I thought I should\n[0:02] do some housekeeping because I I you\n[0:04] know, I got serious. I got I got I went\n[0:07] with Claude and I created a a podcast.\n[0:10] >> So, I wanted to mention that this\n[0:12] podcast should be available on Apple as\n[0:16] well as uh Spotify\n[0:18] as well as, you know, you don't have to\n[0:20] subscribe anywhere. You can just you can\n[0:22] just go here. But I've only got the MP3\n[0:24] version. Oh, I also just wanted to\n[0:27] mention that uh if you wanted to contact\n[0:29] me then Henry at uh icky.fe or canry at\n[0:33] Twitter. I was I was looking at my\n[0:36] email. I couldn't actually find an email\n[0:37] address for you. You were you were at\n[0:39] honest or something like that when I was\n[0:42] looking through my email.\n[0:45] >> What? You don't want to reveal your\n[0:47] email address.\n[0:49] I'm just I was thinking because like the\n[0:51] one that I that's on my commits of my\n[0:54] main GitHub profile are it's like a very\n[0:57] old Gmail that I created when I was like\n[0:59] 12 and I had to take like a name not 12.\n[1:02] Uh when was Gmail?\n[1:05] >> Yeah, you can't be that young.\n[1:08] >> 20. Um\n[1:11] and so it's a it's a silly name. I got\n[1:14] an Outlook that has my full name.\n[1:16] >> Oh, for Christ's sake. I mean, and you\n[1:18] you're complaining me about using Jurro.\n[1:20] Well, anyway, Jira, I'm I'm almost\n[1:22] surprised that that you don't use Jurro\n[1:25] at your work. You don't use Jurro.\n[1:29] [snorts]\n[1:29] >> And and I think I think it's amazing\n[1:31] that like you can use AI to plan to\n[1:34] organize your spreads. Like like half my\n[1:36] my job as a lead is to like chase my\n[1:40] colleagues like, \"Oh, have you updated\n[1:42] your card? Um, are you using the right\n[1:45] template? Have you storyointed the card?\n[1:48] Blah blah blah blah blah.\n[1:50] >> And and Jura is like molasses. So if I\n[1:53] can if I can sync this down to BD and\n[1:55] get AI to run over it, I'm like I've\n[1:58] saved myself 3 hours in.\n[1:59] >> I think it's a very clever hack. It's\n[2:01] kind of a realization of the um the\n[2:05] problem with MCPS a little bit. Although\n[2:08] that your main problem was the latency\n[2:10] of of managing Jira tickets and then\n[2:12] just having a local very fast SQL light.\n[2:15] um issue tracker that then automatically\n[2:18] syncs to Jira. It's it's a clever hack.\n[2:21] It's it's really nice. Um but\n[2:23] unfortunately it uh it mentions Jira. So\n[2:26] by that by definition it has to\n[2:28] [laughter] be\n[2:29] >> it's just uh hosed. Yeah.\n[2:34] >> Same same thing. I'm I'm joking with you\n[2:35] about Python, right? The moment you\n[2:37] mention Python or I'm just joking I see\n[2:39] oh no there's Python in this.\n[2:41] >> Yeah. I mean thank go I feel I feel like\n[2:43] really lucky. I feel like I'm living in\n[2:46] a virtual world. Like I love how AI has\n[2:48] come along and for Python the UV astral\n[2:51] tools.\n[2:52] >> Oh yeah, UV is amazing. UV\n[2:54] >> it is such I like I wouldn't It's so\n[2:58] good. It is so good.\n[2:59] >> It almost makes Python tolerable.\n[3:01] >> It almost makes Python tolerable. Yeah.\n[3:05] As the whole astral stuff, all the\n[3:08] Astral stuff is so good.\n[3:09] >> Are we the baddies?\n[3:11] [laughter]\n[3:12] you know this sketch from um\n[3:14] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[3:15] >> Yeah.\n[3:16] >> Um I can't remember the names. [snorts]\n[3:19] Yeah. UV I actually I'm rolling out\n[3:21] rough at work. Um hopefully I won't get\n[3:24] too many complaints. I'm replacing It's\n[3:27] amazing because with the rough I'm\n[3:29] replacing like like lint black flake 8.\n[3:34] >> Oh, nice.\n[3:35] >> Uh\n[3:37] Bandit.\n[3:39] I'm like replacing the the pre-commit\n[3:41] hooks used to just take forever. Now\n[3:44] they're running like a millisecond. I\n[3:46] mean, thank you. Thank you. Rough and\n[3:48] Rust and\n[3:49] >> Oh, Astral. This is all Astral.\n[3:52] >> Yeah.\n[3:52] >> Okay.\n[3:53] >> Amazing. Amazing. Amazing stuff.\n[3:56] sounds a bit similar to all of the work\n[3:57] that like is happening in the JavaScript\n[3:59] ecosystem with like biome replacing\n[4:01] eslint and vitest replacing just um you\n[4:05] know making typescript more of a first\n[4:08] uh class citizen of the of the\n[4:10] ecosystem. I know your reaction to\n[4:12] TypeScript and this is why I reacted to\n[4:14] about Python that way was like I hate\n[4:16] TypeScript but to be honest\n[4:17] >> to me Typescript is a breath of fresh\n[4:20] air compared to just plain Java script\n[4:23] and um Python. I mean\n[4:25] >> okay um I mean uh\n[4:28] well did you ever come across a guy\n[4:31] called uh TJ Holloway Chuck?\n[4:37] >> No.\n[4:39] >> No. Oh, TJ. I think his GitHub actions\n[4:41] are quite popular. No.\n[4:43] >> Yeah. I mean, he he wrote Okay, this is\n[4:46] a fake account.\n[4:47] >> Different one.\n[4:48] >> Uh,\n[4:50] yeah, that's him. He kind of disappeared\n[4:53] and all his projects are sort of\n[4:54] maintained by other people, but I mean\n[4:57] he wrote Express\n[5:01] back in the day.\n[5:01] >> Are we talking about Okay.\n[5:05] >> No, I don't know why it doesn't show up\n[5:06] in his repos anymore. Oh, I think it's\n[5:08] now like uh\n[5:10] >> in the foundation or an orc.\n[5:12] >> Yeah, something like that. But like I I\n[5:15] often I mean I often sounds like I'm\n[5:18] insane, but like you know sometimes I\n[5:21] get nostalgic and look at his old code\n[5:23] and uh I don't think it's been\n[5:25] Typescript.\n[5:27] I mean it's it's like it's free of all\n[5:29] that sort of stupid annotations unless\n[5:31] someone's uh changed it. But like I\n[5:35] thought that the way I mean what I'm\n[5:36] trying to say is that I learn to write\n[5:38] to write node from his code\n[5:41] and every time I read his code I just\n[5:43] think it's so nice so nice this code\n[5:49] and express is also one of those one of\n[5:53] those projects which which I thought was\n[5:56] something that dragged me back into the\n[5:58] Node.js world for good reasons. But like\n[6:01] yeah, I mean Express is s such an\n[6:03] amazing project. I guess everything's\n[6:05] still kind of Expressbased, right?\n[6:08] >> Mhm.\n[6:09] >> I think you align with with um one of\n[6:12] like you know DHH.\n[6:14] >> Yeah, DHH. Yeah. Yeah. I\n[6:18] he he's uh he's cool. He's cool. He he\n[6:21] launched phys he launched Fizzy, which I\n[6:23] thought was like kind of weird because\n[6:24] you've been talking to me about Bead's\n[6:26] UIs.\n[6:28] >> Yeah. Yeah. That's that's funny. I also\n[6:30] saw him mention about like issue\n[6:32] trackers. Um but in terms of his school,\n[6:36] I I also I don't agree. I had this very\n[6:39] deep conversation with Chad GPT about\n[6:41] attaching politics to technical\n[6:45] um work. For example, DHH he does\n[6:48] amazing projects. I don't like Ruby on\n[6:50] Rails, but I do like um Omari or Omari\n[6:54] and I like Omar before that. And um\n[6:57] >> you're not running that software. You\n[6:59] just like the idea, don't you?\n[7:00] >> No, no. I run I run it on my uh Windows\n[7:02] desktop and I also for new year bought a\n[7:06] one terabyte SSD NVME to install RP and\n[7:10] all the way.\n[7:10] >> That's funny cuz I bought something\n[7:12] similar. What did you buy? Did you buy\n[7:14] exactly the same one I bought?\n[7:16] >> EVO Plus. I think I didn't pay break the\n[7:19] bank. What is this?\n[7:21] >> Yeah, I went I bought a Crucial.\n[7:23] [sighs and snorts]\n[7:24] >> The Samsung ones are like more\n[7:26] expensive. it. Well,\n[7:29] it was a really good salesman\n[7:31] [laughter] because I go to this shop in\n[7:33] Vietnam and Samsung is quite a popular\n[7:35] range of products in Vietnam. And in\n[7:38] Vietnam, you you must have you must have\n[7:40] a brand or quality, right? And so some\n[7:42] shops, they are the official retailers.\n[7:44] >> There's no returns policy. You just go\n[7:46] buy.\n[7:47] >> No,\n[7:48] there is return policy actually with\n[7:50] Fungu. They they open the package\n[7:51] normally and they put a little warranty\n[7:53] sticker but they didn't do it on this\n[7:54] one which is normally when you buy it\n[7:56] they put like a little sticker and they\n[7:58] like tag which but I guess today you can\n[8:00] do it with the receipt but um back in\n[8:03] like 2006 when I came to Vietnam and you\n[8:05] went you bought anything it all needed\n[8:07] to be tested right in the store right\n[8:09] you don't buy anything you don't take\n[8:10] anything home until you have actually\n[8:12] tested it in the store and there's a\n[8:14] little sticker added straight on the\n[8:15] hardware\n[8:16] >> that's cool yeah well I I I always\n[8:18] remember buying light bulbs at the at\n[8:20] the hardware store in Singapore. They\n[8:22] all the the lady always tested the light\n[8:25] bulb before she um you know let me leave\n[8:27] the store and I'm like they would never\n[8:30] do this in England.\n[8:31] >> I think this is a thing in Asia um\n[8:34] because of like cheap knockoffs, right?\n[8:36] Um and so you want to get the quality.\n[8:39] >> So so with this shop where I bought it,\n[8:40] you said Samsung is the more expensive\n[8:42] one. probably be related to their like\n[8:45] um guarantees on on uh on and return\n[8:48] policies and also I've been thinking\n[8:50] about like installing Omari I use Omar\n[8:53] coup right now Ubuntu based with Gnome\n[8:56] right and um I'm having some display\n[8:59] issues sometimes with with Ubuntu but it\n[9:02] works great but lately I've done all my\n[9:04] work on my Mac OS but I want to go back\n[9:06] to like um Linux and and so they\n[9:10] completely pivoted to Omari so I've been\n[9:12] wanting to get a new SSD drive to\n[9:14] install it um since June because my old\n[9:18] SSDs are too small as well. So when I\n[9:21] was there, I bought a router because I\n[9:25] wanted to set some other like separate\n[9:27] network up in my house. And I was there\n[9:31] and I asked him like we I saw the price\n[9:34] of a desktop like a pre-made and he\n[9:36] basically told me one of the\n[9:37] salespersons there was like, \"Oh, you\n[9:39] can buy all of these components and\n[9:40] build it for half the price. Don't buy\n[9:42] this like pre-made.\"\n[9:43] >> Oh, wins when's the trust.\n[9:46] >> Like Yeah, you're right. You're right.\n[9:48] What else? What? Tell me about\n[9:50] >> I just bought I just went in for a VPN\n[9:52] rout um sorry a router that has VPN\n[9:54] support and um and then I he for some\n[9:58] reason I I was looking at the desktop.\n[9:59] They have these gaming desktops on on\n[10:01] display, right? And he made that comment\n[10:03] and I was like, \"Yeah, but like memory\n[10:05] and GPU right now is crazy, right?\" And\n[10:07] he's like, \"Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.\" And\n[10:09] then I was like, \"I've been wanting to\n[10:10] buy an SSD.\" And he was like, \"Oh, the\n[10:13] price is going to go up.\"\n[10:14] >> And I'm like, \"What? I know memory and\n[10:16] GPU is going to go up, but what about\n[10:18] about like hard hard disks? And he was\n[10:20] like, \"No, no, because in Vietnam, China\n[10:22] is buying all of this. They're buying\n[10:24] all the memory. They're buying all the\n[10:25] GP GPU from all the neighboring\n[10:27] countries.\"\n[10:29] >> Yeah. Yeah. And and because they're\n[10:30] building AI rigs and and so they are\n[10:32] >> sense of urgency is created and the\n[10:34] buyer\n[10:36] >> he immediately created the sense of\n[10:37] urgency and I was like, \"Yeah, I've been\n[10:39] thinking about it for for six months.\"\n[10:42] And I was like, \"Yeah, but I haven't\n[10:43] used my Ubuntu for a while.\" So I was\n[10:45] like, \"Ah, there's no urgency for me\n[10:47] there, right?\" And he was like, \"No, no,\n[10:48] no. It's going to go up.\" And I was\n[10:49] like, \"Oh, okay then, [laughter]\n[10:52] you know,\n[10:52] >> last well.\"\n[10:54] >> And then when I check out, he looks at\n[10:56] the bill and I said, and and I'm like,\n[10:58] \"Yeah, it's a bit expensive, but it's\n[10:59] like Christmas, right?\" And he's like,\n[11:01] \"Yeah, but that's like half my salary.\n[11:03] That's half my monthly salary.\" And\n[11:05] [laughter] I was like,\n[11:07] >> \"Dude, I think you was asking for a tip.\n[11:11] >> Do do you tip people in in Vietnam?\" No.\n[11:14] Not in that shop, but it used to be a\n[11:16] very like uh\n[11:17] >> depends if it's a bar and good someone's\n[11:20] good-looking, I suppose. Maybe.\n[11:21] [laughter]\n[11:24] >> Cool. Well, places. I don't know what\n[11:27] you're talking about. [laughter]\n[11:31] [snorts]\n[11:31] >> Well, let's see. Let me think.\n[11:34] Oh, okay. Let me just rattle off some\n[11:36] thoughts.\n[11:38] Are you using Ghosty?\n[11:42] No, but I heard that Ghosty fixes the\n[11:44] scroll bug in cloud code, so I'm\n[11:46] thinking about it.\n[11:47] >> I switched to Ghosty and I'm loving it\n[11:50] actually.\n[11:51] >> Mhm.\n[11:52] >> And this is Ghosty right here. Okay. Um,\n[11:55] can you see my whole screen? You can see\n[11:56] it. You can see this.\n[11:58] >> Yeah. And I see your duffel API key. And\n[11:59] No, I'm just kidding. [laughter]\n[12:02] >> Yo, don't think I need this keybind. I'm\n[12:04] just taking it off.\n[12:06] Yeah, I'm loving Ghosty. It's It's fast.\n[12:09] Um,\n[12:12] >> want to give it background like it's\n[12:14] Hashimoto.\n[12:15] >> Oh yeah, you can project after exiting.\n[12:18] >> I don't go for that whole like what do\n[12:20] you call it?\n[12:22] >> Um,\n[12:23] >> it's written in Zigg or Rust. Zigg,\n[12:25] right?\n[12:25] >> Yeah, it's fast\n[12:29] and like it does like weird things which\n[12:32] is I think is quite cool. Like when it\n[12:34] seems to know that like it's waiting\n[12:36] sometimes. I don't know how this is\n[12:37] expressed in tone language,\n[12:39] >> but I'm I'm I'm loving it. I'm loving\n[12:41] it. This uh and uh and Claude I I'm I'm\n[12:46] often like I'm still a little bit\n[12:47] confused how to init my like how do you\n[12:49] init your project? I go get initi\n[12:54] and and and then and then but then it's\n[12:57] still but then I still have to do\n[13:00] something like um\n[13:04] like like this, right? before any is is\n[13:07] that how you set up beats or do you do\n[13:09] something else?\n[13:11] >> I have not set up beats in a new\n[13:13] project. I'm working in a fairly large\n[13:15] monor repo right now. So I just\n[13:19] fine-tune whatever is there and um\n[13:22] >> but what you just showed seemed to be\n[13:23] like the nice way of doing it.\n[13:26] >> You still have a performance issue.\n[13:27] >> Yeah, there's still a performance issue.\n[13:29] I'm not too sure why. You mentioned that\n[13:31] that the demon runs or something.\n[13:34] Yeah. So I was on beats version 0.21 or\n[13:36] something and there was some demon\n[13:38] socket issue or maybe in later versions\n[13:41] there was a demon socket issue. I\n[13:42] definitely saw some um issues about\n[13:46] performance in in the GitHub repo and\n[13:48] people were saying it's a leftover demon\n[13:51] socket\n[13:51] >> that need to be killed. So if you kill\n[13:53] all the demons usually it solves the\n[13:55] problem.\n[13:55] >> Okay, maybe you're right. I just killed\n[13:57] them all and now it's faster. [laughter]\n[13:59] >> Yay.\n[14:01] Okay, that's one problem solved.\n[14:03] >> That's one problem with beads though,\n[14:05] like there's a new release every two\n[14:07] days. [laughter]\n[14:08] Uh there's a a slew of duplicate like um\n[14:11] commands because it's all AI generated.\n[14:13] So there's no consistency and it\n[14:15] reintroduces bugs all the time or it\n[14:17] creates completely new bugs and then you\n[14:19] get like\n[14:19] >> I think I think Steve is definitely like\n[14:23] not coding. You know what I mean?\n[14:25] >> Oh crap. Oh, sorry. What? [laughter]\n[14:27] >> He doesn't seem to be coding. Oh yeah,\n[14:29] you showed me that pull request. Uh,\n[14:31] which one was it?\n[14:32] >> The the what was it about the ali cats\n[14:36] looking for work in the graveyard?\n[14:40] And um it's the pole I think it's it's\n[14:42] his test. It's it's like pole cat.\n[14:46] Search for pole cat. It's not graveyard.\n[14:48] It's like junkyard.\n[14:50] >> So I can't find it.\n[14:52] >> Yeah, he he has some very interesting\n[14:55] commits. But um what worries me when I\n[14:58] want to update this this thing this\n[14:59] binary is that I see commits like fix uh\n[15:02] file corruption issue and all this stuff\n[15:05] and I'm like wait what they have like\n[15:06] file corruption issues at\n[15:08] >> point I I've had some weird merge issues\n[15:10] but I mean but but since I know that\n[15:12] like you know [snorts] since I know that\n[15:15] the source of truth is is uh this file\n[15:18] here.\n[15:20] Let me go BD crate foo bar whatever.\n[15:26] Yeah, since I know since I know how it\n[15:29] works kind of\n[15:31] uh I can go in here and fix things. But\n[15:35] I'm just surprised it happens. Like I'm\n[15:36] really really surprised it happens. But\n[15:38] anyway, whatever. A great find for me\n[15:41] when I wanted to update Beats was um I\n[15:45] went through any of the UI projects that\n[15:47] are going on and just a few days ago\n[15:50] somebody um created a TUI a terminal UI\n[15:54] for beats called\n[15:54] >> Oh yeah, which one? Yeah, you which one\n[15:56] is that?\n[15:56] >> P E R L E S. It's in the root read me\n[15:59] also.\n[16:00] >> P E R L E S. Well, yeah, if you go to\n[16:04] the read me. Yeah, pearls but the French\n[16:06] way. Pearl. Yeah. At pearl the pear.\n[16:10] Belush.\n[16:13] >> It sounds dirty. Honestly,\n[16:17] >> what I said was pearls for the swines.\n[16:20] [laughter]\n[16:23] >> Yeah.\n[16:24] >> So, this one, download it, dude. Try it\n[16:26] out.\n[16:29] >> Oh, I thought it was a web thing.\n[16:31] >> No. So I I've been using Beats UI but\n[16:34] Bets UI doesn't show comments on issues\n[16:36] and it doesn't show uh it doesn't allow\n[16:38] easy tree navigation from one issue to\n[16:40] the other and and the dependencies.\n[16:43] >> It doesn't show\n[16:45] um\n[16:47] what was it there was some other issues\n[16:48] that I had ah it doesn't allow me to\n[16:50] filter by labels. So, so this thing is\n[16:53] if you like Jira, this seems to be the\n[16:55] Jira for beats. Okay, because one of the\n[16:57] things you can do is Jira is you can\n[16:59] build your combon boards with your\n[17:00] columns and you can doing some query\n[17:02] language there, right? Not that I ever\n[17:03] use Jira or or you know care about Jira,\n[17:06] but somebody told me that you can do\n[17:09] these query language um for your columns\n[17:11] and your boards and your views and all\n[17:12] that, right? So, they have this BQL\n[17:14] beatsql and it's like a lexer with a\n[17:16] parser. Yeah, this is a little bit\n[17:19] unsettling that things have gone towards\n[17:21] Jura so quickly [laughter]\n[17:24] like beats it was so simple now now the\n[17:26] people are doing this\n[17:27] >> but the good thing is this is all\n[17:28] separate from beats yeah you can get\n[17:30] this if you want so I I used his like\n[17:33] kbon view but you can't like cross\n[17:36] reference columns like if you create one\n[17:38] column with something and then you want\n[17:39] another column to to use something from\n[17:41] that you can't do that so if you want to\n[17:43] build a tree of dependencies or you want\n[17:45] to navigate and and he didn't seem seem\n[17:47] to like have a very deeply nested uh\n[17:50] beats issue. Maybe I can show you how it\n[17:52] looks on my on my machine.\n[17:55] >> The the next thing I couldn't help but\n[17:56] think is like estimation points,\n[17:58] velocity,\n[18:03] >> you can see the screen.\n[18:05] >> Yeah.\n[18:06] >> Oh. Oh, how did that get up there?\n[18:10] >> Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, I mean, yeah, if\n[18:12] you want to spend some time talking\n[18:13] about grid.\n[18:14] >> Um, no tangent here. So,\n[18:18] that's a bit of uh crap here, but let's\n[18:20] let's maximize this view. You got to be\n[18:22] able to maximize.\n[18:24] >> So, here we are. Uh\n[18:25] >> maybe maybe control plus a bit. I mean,\n[18:28] no one's going to be able to read this\n[18:30] on YouTube otherwise.\n[18:31] >> Oh, that's going to that's not going to\n[18:33] look good, is it?\n[18:36] >> I'm going to have to control minuses a\n[18:37] bit. Is that acceptable?\n[18:41] >> Okay. I guess you're just showing the\n[18:43] aesthetics, I suppose.\n[18:45] >> Yeah. So\n[18:47] this is the standard view of per\n[18:50] uh if you want to pronounce it the\n[18:51] French way and you see there's like the\n[18:54] blocked the ready um the in progress and\n[18:57] the closed issues right classic I added\n[19:00] another view which is just showing the\n[19:02] epics\n[19:03] >> and then from an epic\n[19:04] >> I go into the epic and I can see the\n[19:07] full progress of this epic so I have\n[19:09] like 57 beats tasks in this epic and I\n[19:14] wish I could like narrow this column So\n[19:16] there those little symbols at the end\n[19:17] mean that like the agent is is choing\n[19:19] down on it or what does it mean?\n[19:21] >> Yeah. So the little check marks if you\n[19:22] see them are completed tasks and then\n[19:25] the green ones green like circles are\n[19:28] this is not yet um implemented. Actually\n[19:31] these it should be nice if there's like\n[19:33] red for for blocked and and green for\n[19:35] ready to to pick up. Maybe that's\n[19:37] something that we could uh request. And\n[19:40] then here we have uh the blue one here\n[19:42] the full full blue circle. You can see\n[19:44] that one is in progress, right? So, so\n[19:48] you can navigate the full dependency\n[19:50] tree and\n[19:51] >> when earlier the reason why I bring this\n[19:53] up is because most people don't really\n[19:56] have this like deep nested uh list. I\n[19:59] think I mean if I look at my\n[20:02] >> I mean at work I'm often on a jura board\n[20:05] with epic features tasks and it's it's a\n[20:09] nightmare just to to go between them. I\n[20:11] mean I mean there is this like chicklet\n[20:12] thing but like you know how Jurro is so\n[20:15] slow just just the fact that just the\n[20:18] fact that you're moving between issues\n[20:20] in a tree like that just\n[20:23] makes me feel unusual.\n[20:26] [snorts]\n[20:26] >> Don't talk about Jira. We don't talk\n[20:29] about Jira.\n[20:30] So for me like this was my main uh view\n[20:33] that I used of this beats UI which was\n[20:35] like the epics view and then when I\n[20:37] wanted to look I could see like the the\n[20:39] phases of each of the user stories uh\n[20:43] for this epic. So I'm working on um\n[20:45] terraform state delete uh with like soft\n[20:48] delete tombstones and and then terapform\n[20:50] state rename functionality and so maybe\n[20:53] again this is an epic it should have\n[20:55] been scoped down I don't know but um\n[20:57] this is the things I'm missing. So for\n[20:59] example, there's a user story here. When\n[21:01] I click on it, I can see all of its\n[21:02] dependencies. Ah, there's another thing.\n[21:04] There are design and notes here and\n[21:06] everything. And then when I look at the\n[21:08] dependencies,\n[21:09] >> you can I have this little graph view,\n[21:10] but it's I can't click on anything and\n[21:12] and it's it's not really nice.\n[21:14] >> So this is where\n[21:16] >> ditch that project and move to the\n[21:17] terminal.\n[21:19] >> Yeah. Um I I was like I was doing pull\n[21:22] request to add the tree view but then he\n[21:24] added his own version and it was\n[21:26] >> how come the issue names have like quite\n[21:28] weird naming like I I thought it was\n[21:31] just like now now you have AS3 3.4.12\n[21:34] 4.12 what?\n[21:35] >> Yes. Um I noticed beats does that when\n[21:38] you create a new task that is that has a\n[21:41] parent. So it will just append.1 point\n[21:44] two parent.\n[21:46] >> I I don't know because I also\n[21:47] >> How come I haven't noticed that?\n[21:49] >> This is after I upgraded it started\n[21:51] doing that.\n[21:53] >> I see. Okay. Right.\n[21:55] >> Yeah.\n[21:56] >> So what happens if you move a task to\n[21:58] another feature or something or or epic?\n[22:01] Then it might mess up a bit. But anyway,\n[22:03] >> move task. Tasks are not open long\n[22:05] enough to move things around, bro.\n[22:08] >> Yay.\n[22:09] >> Right now, I created this whole tree\n[22:12] yesterday with Opus 4 and I've completed\n[22:14] 50% of it. Um, this morning, okay, so\n[22:19] that was we talked a little bit about\n[22:21] like beats issue management and your uh\n[22:24] synchronization. There's quite a few\n[22:26] changes in in AI land as well like cloud\n[22:30] just released something called resumable\n[22:32] agents. So if you prompt cloud and tell\n[22:34] it to send the agent to the background\n[22:36] then that agent becomes resumable which\n[22:38] is like a very early way of um you know\n[22:43] before when you when you say like hey\n[22:44] spawn three sub agents to do a task they\n[22:46] spawn they complete and then you know\n[22:48] they're dead.\n[22:49] >> So it sounds like you can get the\n[22:50] context back if you wanted to pick it\n[22:52] up.\n[22:53] >> That's that seems to be the goal. um it\n[22:55] was on Reddit and people were saying\n[22:57] about this\n[22:58] >> because in my mind BD is the is the key\n[23:02] because it keeps the context in a task\n[23:04] right in a in a in an issue.\n[23:06] >> Yeah. So if I\n[23:08] >> if and I'm just like paranoid nowadays\n[23:10] of using since I've been using AI so\n[23:12] long like I just don't want context to\n[23:14] be anywhere else almost except in that\n[23:17] task.\n[23:18] >> Exactly. So so if we look at this task\n[23:20] here like this is a very detailed task\n[23:22] right. It shows what we are trying to do\n[23:25] the goal. Then there's the acceptance\n[23:26] criteria of like we need to actually is\n[23:29] a mistake here. I should have design\n[23:31] first and then acceptance criteria.\n[23:33] >> Okay. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n[23:35] Yeah. Progressive disclosure.\n[23:37] >> Yes. Um I don't like this. Um I'm I'm\n[23:41] going to do a PR to fix this. This is my\n[23:42] PR originally. He already merged it. U\n[23:45] but I I I realized it later that it was\n[23:47] wrong. So anyway, um, and then the most\n[23:51] important thing is that I want to be\n[23:52] able like you just said, spawn an agent\n[23:54] from this task or maybe from a user\n[23:56] story so that they can complete because\n[23:57] these tasks are very detailed. The most\n[23:59] important thing is it tells exactly\n[24:01] which file to change, right? Which is so\n[24:05] crucial um, if you want to spin up\n[24:07] agents like Haiku and they don't need to\n[24:09] like explore the whole codebase, just\n[24:11] keep them focused on a little sub part.\n[24:13] Definitely if you're working on like a\n[24:14] monor repo type of thing. Yeah, I mean\n[24:16] to be honest, I do that with my\n[24:17] colleagues. I say these are the in the\n[24:19] in the scope section of the of a ticket.\n[24:21] I say these are the the files that\n[24:23] you're going to change. You're not going\n[24:24] to go anywhere else,\n[24:27] >> right?\n[24:28] >> I do this already with my colleagues.\n[24:29] >> So, so, so, so agents with this should\n[24:32] work perfectly, right? You give them a\n[24:34] small task, they complete it like how\n[24:35] you code completes it and then the\n[24:37] overall main thread of your cloud code\n[24:40] the context is saved because it doesn't\n[24:42] need to read the whole file iterate on\n[24:43] making the changes and then you know\n[24:46] that main context stays clean and and\n[24:48] focused on what is the overall goal and\n[24:50] just coordinates the sub agents. So I\n[24:52] tried earlier to say like okay there's\n[24:55] some of these tasks they are ready and\n[24:57] they can be done in parallel and spawn\n[24:58] two agents to do it but I wanted the\n[25:00] agents to confirm to me first that they\n[25:02] were doing the right thing. So I told in\n[25:05] the prompt that you sent to the agent\n[25:07] make sure to ask it to check in early\n[25:09] and it came back to me um with a\n[25:11] check-in and then I and it was like it\n[25:14] asked like a lot of questions I hadn't\n[25:16] even thought about and\n[25:17] >> it's amazing. So it's kind of mirroring\n[25:19] my life. So basically it's it's doing a\n[25:21] kickoff. It's basically asking any\n[25:22] clarifying questions, right? We call\n[25:24] this a kickoff. And uh\n[25:27] >> yeah. And um and then what happened is I\n[25:29] said, \"Okay, great cloud. I heard you\n[25:32] have this resume capability. Now resume\n[25:34] those agents um but there's a bug. So\n[25:36] they don't see their initial prompt. So\n[25:38] make sure to reiterate your original\n[25:39] initial prompt and then together with\n[25:42] your um um approval of their plan and\n[25:45] then it send kick off an agent and they\n[25:47] completed a task. But then later I asked\n[25:49] it, \"Hey Cloud, do you have agent IDs?\n[25:51] Do you know how to resume agents?\" And\n[25:53] it was like, \"No, there are no agent\n[25:54] IDs.\" No, I cannot resume. I was like,\n[25:57] \"Oh, okay. So what just happened?\" Like\n[25:59] >> that's really interesting. So things are\n[26:01] things are evolving quite quickly. I I\n[26:04] listened to an anthropic uh video last\n[26:07] night and\n[26:09] the emphasis with with respect to agents\n[26:12] was skills. So, I'm wondering to myself,\n[26:16] have you adopted that workflow where\n[26:18] your agents are you attach skills to\n[26:22] your agents? I believe like do you ever\n[26:25] do that\n[26:26] >> I I think we saw the same YouTube about\n[26:27] don't build um don't build agents but\n[26:31] build skills, right?\n[26:32] >> Yeah. Yeah, that one. Oh, man. We're\n[26:35] we're in an echo chamber here. We're\n[26:36] like reading the same things.\n[26:38] >> I saw it on on Reddit. Um, and I haven't\n[26:41] been able to watch it because like I\n[26:42] said, my audio is not working right now.\n[26:44] I don't know.\n[26:44] >> It's nothing. It's nothing too amazing\n[26:46] to be honest. It was a bit is a bit\n[26:48] tame, but like\n[26:50] >> Yeah. So, I do have the agent skill\n[26:53] here.\n[26:54] >> I mean, I have the beat skill here cuz I\n[26:56] told you how crucial the beat skill was,\n[26:57] right? It It really made it really gave\n[27:00] Cloud the edge compared to other\n[27:02] >> You haven't written your own skills yet?\n[27:05] >> No. No. Nothing else. I'm also still I'm\n[27:08] still struggling to maybe I've just\n[27:10] forgotten how to do it, but like like\n[27:12] like how do you like package manage\n[27:14] skills? Like how do you like just bring\n[27:16] skill into a project? Like like how do\n[27:18] you like isn't there like a cuz you get\n[27:21] plugins but they're not the same as\n[27:22] skills. So I'm a little bit confused\n[27:25] like I I want to like add Vincent's\n[27:28] skill repository and get XY Z skill or\n[27:32] reference that skill inside the the\n[27:34] agent or something.\n[27:36] Uh\n[27:37] >> so this is somebody that I know on\n[27:39] LinkedIn. He he built some TypeScript\n[27:42] project but he wasn't at at Meta. He he\n[27:46] was asking the question how do we\n[27:48] package like create bundles to easily\n[27:50] deploy um what you said like these\n[27:53] capability like plugins are MCPs skills\n[27:55] agents what how do we build these and\n[27:58] and and have them\n[27:59] >> like bootstrapped into into agent\n[28:01] shells? Um, and then he posted on\n[28:04] hackernews something called source\n[28:05] wizard. Um, which is I think a project\n[28:08] trying to do this, but it has the same\n[28:10] question as what you just asked, right?\n[28:11] >> Like how do we create bug?\n[28:13] >> I'm sure I'm sure Anthropic is working\n[28:15] on it. Like the a previous project that\n[28:17] I used to be quite into was called GBT\n[28:20] script. Have you heard of that one?\n[28:23] >> Let me share my script.\n[28:25] >> Gib script. Um, hold on. I need to\n[28:32] You sound like eggshell from M MRC.\n[28:36] >> Eggshell.\n[28:38] >> Was it XL? The thing that you use for\n[28:40] scripting bots on Mr. C.\n[28:45] >> Um Oh, yeah. I Yeah.\n[28:51] IROC. That brings me back\n[28:53] tunnels bounce. I'm actually still on\n[28:55] IRC. I don't know if you're on free node\n[28:57] and all that sort of stuff. There is a\n[28:59] relevant QRDC comic. What's it called?\n[29:02] XKDC. X KDC comic. XKCD.\n[29:07] >> So I'm I'm a lot of this stuff is is\n[29:11] prior R in a way like GBT script done by\n[29:15] the same guy behind Rancher Labs. Uh\n[29:18] Darren uh can't remember his name.\n[29:20] >> Wow. I didn't know he was doing other\n[29:22] stuff cuz I used to follow him on\n[29:24] Twitter.\n[29:25] >> Yeah, he's he's great on Twitter. I\n[29:26] build the cloud. So One thing about GBTS\n[29:29] script is that\n[29:32] they have this concept of of yeah tools.\n[29:35] So you have different tools and you can\n[29:37] these these in my opinion are are agents\n[29:41] really.\n[29:42] >> You can you yeah you can have tools and\n[29:44] they do certain things. So you reference\n[29:46] them in your like your front matter like\n[29:49] I want the random number tool. I mean\n[29:51] these are skills right and and then he\n[29:54] and then they they can be packaged at\n[29:56] the end of a URL. I mean, so what I'm\n[29:58] trying to say is that I'm sure Anthropic\n[30:00] are just going to like do do something\n[30:02] very similar.\n[30:03] >> Yeah. MCP was kind of the goal of like\n[30:05] having a redistributable and they put in\n[30:07] the plug-in marketplace and they're\n[30:10] definitely going to make bundles.\n[30:11] >> Yeah, they're definitely going to do\n[30:13] this. It's it's it's I guess it's\n[30:15] >> and hooks.\n[30:16] >> Do you know Beats now installs a hook if\n[30:18] you do Beats Doctor?\n[30:21] Yeah, I'm not too sure. I thought that\n[30:22] was a reason why my things were getting\n[30:24] slow, but what is\n[30:26] >> I don't like the hook.\n[30:27] >> Yeah, like it makes Yeah, I I want to be\n[30:30] >> I don't know. I'm I'm partial on it\n[30:32] because I'm like I keep staging my work\n[30:34] and then my commits are huge and the\n[30:36] hook is like telling it complete the\n[30:38] task and then, you know, do the commit.\n[30:41] And I am very reluctant to let the LLM\n[30:43] commit. I'm like heavily in the loop\n[30:45] like I want to commit to work. I I\n[30:47] noticed a tweet from you or something on\n[30:49] LinkedIn about [clears throat]\n[30:51] missing a file. I honestly had the\n[30:53] experience where\n[30:56] I don't know how it happened, but the\n[30:58] file I was working on got nuked while an\n[31:00] agent was running in the same repo. So,\n[31:03] I mean, I'm mature enough. I'm old\n[31:05] enough not to delete my own files\n[31:07] accidentally. So, I'm like, how did\n[31:11] >> we ever old enough not to delete our own\n[31:13] files? I just did like an hour ago.\n[31:17] So, I looked into git stash. There was\n[31:18] no git stash because I would I would\n[31:20] assume that the AI would be smart enough\n[31:22] to stash it if if they didn't understand\n[31:24] why why my file was hanging around and\n[31:27] it wasn't there. And and and I was like\n[31:31] quite\n[31:32] shocked about it. But but then I\n[31:34] remembered that VS Code has this local\n[31:36] file history feature.\n[31:37] >> Yes, I was about to say it's amazing.\n[31:39] >> And I and I managed to pick out a an old\n[31:40] copy of the file I was working. I was\n[31:42] like,\n[31:42] >> \"Visual Studio Code cache is a lifesaver\n[31:46] if you accidentally.\"\n[31:47] >> Thank you, Visual Studio Code. Thank\n[31:48] you.\n[31:49] >> It's it's if you don't know about it,\n[31:51] it's it's such a surprise and it happens\n[31:53] sometimes, but I I keep forgetting some\n[31:55] but it happens where you accidentally\n[31:57] remove or or you want to get back to an\n[31:58] older version of a certain file and\n[32:00] cache and the cache has it.\n[32:03] >> So, it's really uh\n[32:05] >> lifesaver. Yeah.\n[32:07] >> Team VS Code. Um sadly, but truly. Hey,\n[32:12] Microsoft.\n[32:13] >> So, I um yeah, so I did I was going to\n[32:17] mention I didn't use I just used Beads\n[32:19] and Claude to to basically roll out this\n[32:22] feature and I thought it went quite well\n[32:23] and and there's there's a lot to it like\n[32:26] um\n[32:28] like for example, do you know about uh\n[32:30] redo?\n[32:35] Redo\n[32:37] or just redo?\n[32:40] No, I don't. No, we do.\n[32:41] >> It's kind of like a very niche uh well\n[32:45] niche. It's just like an unknown make\n[32:47] replacement.\n[32:49] And to my surprise, I didn't even like\n[32:51] instruct the AI about it. It just knew\n[32:54] what to do. It just did it.\n[32:57] So,\n[32:58] >> like it tried to see if it was on the\n[32:59] path and then start using it.\n[33:01] >> Well, I told it to use red do, but it it\n[33:03] knows how to write the language.\n[33:06] Ah\n[33:07] >> and and uh I I just wanted to mention\n[33:09] that like while I was developing that\n[33:11] podcast uh cache that it wrote all these\n[33:14] redo files like perfectly. it understood\n[33:16] the principles because the the principle\n[33:18] of redo is that it's like make you have\n[33:20] a target\n[33:22] >> and the way that you use standard out\n[33:24] and standard error um sort of\n[33:27] contributes to how the that particular\n[33:29] thing gets created like it has this\n[33:31] concept of different uh named uh I don't\n[33:35] know what you call these things\n[33:36] >> arguments positional arguments\n[33:39] [snorts]\n[33:39] >> so\n[33:41] so basically when it um yeah it. And the\n[33:46] cool thing about redo is is unlike make\n[33:49] which is no one can ever write a script\n[33:51] inside make because of the weird\n[33:53] escaping that you have to make. You just\n[33:55] write it in shell.\n[33:58] >> But with the with these paradigms of\n[33:59] using these name things, then you\n[34:01] replicate the whole make target type\n[34:03] stuff. So if you want to if if you're\n[34:05] missing uh you know fubar.mpp3,\n[34:08] it knows exactly how to make it.\n[34:11] >> Okay.\n[34:12] Yeah, I was I was I was impressed that\n[34:14] it was able just to go go with it. And\n[34:16] uh so I didn't use uh I didn't use\n[34:20] specit. I just basically said I want\n[34:22] this this this and this that done and it\n[34:25] did it. And I was like wow\n[34:28] >> do I need I still need to learn specit.\n[34:31] >> So somebody on on on Reddit was like\n[34:33] what is your guys what is your workflow?\n[34:36] And his workflow was like I use cloud\n[34:39] you know client like the the desktop\n[34:42] cloud code not cloud CLI the the cloud\n[34:46] uh client desktop\n[34:47] >> desktop client sheesh I can't speak he\n[34:50] uses that and then he just um you know\n[34:52] gets the prompts to put them into cloud\n[34:54] code and then basically copy paste\n[34:56] between them and that's how I started\n[34:57] with chatgbt right and that's where I I\n[35:00] I I said like speckit is\n[35:02] >> yeah that's true like there's different\n[35:04] like levels of maturities\n[35:07] And most like 99% of my colleagues are\n[35:10] still sit in chat GBT UI type thing.\n[35:14] Yeah.\n[35:14] >> Which is fine. Like I like what my reply\n[35:17] basically to him was like for my large\n[35:19] project I use the spec kit flows because\n[35:21] it kind of um removes all of that copy\n[35:24] paste and it helps me like I showed you\n[35:26] the task. They're very like limited\n[35:29] [clears throat] to exactly what you need\n[35:30] to change where. So, we got this grand\n[35:32] design like with Opus. It's like a big\n[35:35] to-do list, but instead you can break it\n[35:37] down into small little cloud sessions\n[35:38] that are focused on the individual\n[35:40] files.\n[35:41] >> If you have Yeah.\n[35:42] >> If you have a really big project, you\n[35:44] can go to that level, but like it takes\n[35:46] a day to do that. Like I said, it I used\n[35:48] to tell you like it's like 60% of the\n[35:50] time I'm doing this and then I was\n[35:51] saying 70% of the remaining time, which\n[35:54] is of course.\n[35:55] >> Yeah. So, like I think the way I\n[35:57] prompted it was like I think I started\n[35:58] with an epic\n[36:01] um or maybe two epics. And yeah, I guess\n[36:05] the beautiful thing here is that we can\n[36:06] look I don't know if you checked in your\n[36:08] yourjson\n[36:10] L, but like I guess one thing we can\n[36:14] look forward to doing in the future is\n[36:15] like is like seeing which you know going\n[36:20] through the tasks and seeing which ones\n[36:24] got completed well and then and then\n[36:27] maybe studying studying the description\n[36:31] to see, you know, what's working and\n[36:33] what's not working, you know, like\n[36:36] this is not very this is not very\n[36:38] readable, but I was I was hoping that\n[36:40] you and I could just say or you could\n[36:42] say, \"Kai, you're a genius for\n[36:43] prompting.\"\n[36:45] >> Uh,\n[36:46] >> so what I was I I had the thought today\n[36:48] that I I should try this, I should try\n[36:50] that because I'm trying to fix this sub\n[36:52] agent problem and every time I try it,\n[36:54] it like spawn an agent and then no 50/50\n[36:57] coin toss, maybe it does the thing I\n[36:59] want and then it uses all my tokens and\n[37:00] then I'm not happy. Um, so, so yes, I\n[37:04] want to spend more time on that, but I\n[37:06] also want to just complete the task.\n[37:08] Like I just had Opus generate all the\n[37:10] tasks and I was like, now it should be\n[37:11] fine to let Gemini do everything and it\n[37:13] save all of my clock.\n[37:14] >> That resonates a lot with me because I I\n[37:17] mean that's my\n[37:18] >> I don't do it\n[37:20] >> because I'm going to waste because\n[37:22] Gemini is going to give me something and\n[37:24] maybe some of it works, maybe some of it\n[37:25] doesn't and I don't trust it. So I'm\n[37:28] like right now I'm not going to do that.\n[37:30] So, it's you need to find like if you\n[37:33] want to do this, you need to dedicate a\n[37:34] budget to it because it's going to cost\n[37:36] money. You need to budget dedicate time\n[37:38] and you need to build your benchmarks\n[37:39] and your evolves and you need to do it\n[37:40] properly.\n[37:41] >> It's it's a whole job. And\n[37:43] >> I was I was going to say that like you\n[37:45] like half of me wants to get the thing\n[37:46] done and then half of me wants to to to\n[37:48] to do a retro to to see what worked and\n[37:52] what didn't work. to to make sure that\n[37:54] like I have that feeling that I learned\n[37:56] something because because yeah I mean\n[38:02] >> I want I want to build and I want to\n[38:03] learn from the build all the time\n[38:05] >> because I'm very religiously asking the\n[38:08] every time that a task was not correct I\n[38:11] ask it to record the problems as\n[38:13] comments on the task. So supposedly the\n[38:15] JSONL that I have should clearly\n[38:18] indicate that uh here we had a\n[38:20] divergence here we have a divergence and\n[38:22] it should clearly highlight the problems\n[38:23] but there's so many dimensions in terms\n[38:26] of like the overall scope of the project\n[38:28] like why diverge\n[38:30] >> it's very hard um to so so my approach\n[38:34] today is I try it I give it a good go\n[38:37] how far how much com how comfortable I\n[38:40] am in terms of time and in terms of\n[38:42] rectifying the output\n[38:44] I don't want to throw away the work. I\n[38:45] think the right way would be to just\n[38:47] like, oh, I throw away a lot of that\n[38:48] work and I start again. Um, so I don't I\n[38:51] don't do that right now. And so,\n[38:54] >> yeah, I'm I'm Yeah, I that whole\n[38:56] throwaway thing doesn't make sense to\n[38:58] me. Like I'm I'm always just picking up\n[39:01] the pieces. Oh, did you see my my blog\n[39:04] about Sorry to change the topic. AI\n[39:07] annoyances. I don't know if any of these\n[39:09] resonated with you\n[39:10] >> before before we go there because you\n[39:12] asked about the workflows and I\n[39:14] mentioned about the Reddit comment about\n[39:16] the copy pasting and then using spec\n[39:18] kit. What I wanted to say was at the end\n[39:20] of my comment I realized that actually a\n[39:24] lot of the time I'm just asking Gemini\n[39:26] tree and I have to like say I constantly\n[39:28] flip-flop between them. But today I have\n[39:30] cloud code as my main like big project\n[39:33] workhorse and then I have Gemini tree\n[39:35] for I don't care what you do. this is\n[39:37] the problem I see, fix it. And it just\n[39:40] goes and does, you know, goes off and\n[39:41] then I check in. Sometimes I do the make\n[39:43] test. I do the make build and if it\n[39:45] works, I'm happy. I don't care about the\n[39:47] code because that was basically my\n[39:49] conclusion. Um, and then like I don't\n[39:51] know if that makes sense. So you don't\n[39:54] let me just write this down. So\n[39:56] basically right now you're using using\n[39:58] Claude I don't know son 4.5 whatever,\n[40:02] right? or you're using Opus whatever\n[40:05] you're just using claw code\n[40:07] >> and then what and then I I didn't quite\n[40:10] understand how you you throw it over to\n[40:12] Gemini Gemini 3 pro pro right yeah so on\n[40:16] the project that I'm currently using\n[40:18] cloud code I wanted to use Gemini but I\n[40:20] decided not to and I have like three\n[40:22] other repos that I'm doing at the same\n[40:25] time so on one side I'm adding an API\n[40:27] new functionality on the other side I\n[40:29] have a completely separate repository\n[40:31] and binary that consumes the SDK Okay,\n[40:33] I'm I'm saying like hey uh we need to\n[40:35] start doing this and that and then I ask\n[40:37] that Gemini and I don't do speckit. I\n[40:39] don't do anything. It's like I don't\n[40:40] care about that project.\n[40:41] >> So but I'm I'm just what do you ask\n[40:44] Gemini to just to review the task? I\n[40:46] don't quite understand what\n[40:47] >> no complete separate. So one one\n[40:49] repository I use cloud code opus 4.5\n[40:52] create and specit broken down by tasks\n[40:56] and it's a large monor repo across many\n[40:58] files. uh and and and I the goal is to\n[41:01] have Son or Gemini 3 do the actual\n[41:04] implementation but today I and I find it\n[41:07] very silly because Sun 4.5 and Gemini 3\n[41:09] to me are no different. So I I should be\n[41:11] able to trust Gemini 3 for that project\n[41:13] but I don't and I do trust Gemini\n[41:16] everywhere else like no specitate\n[41:17] nothing Gemini you're more you're more\n[41:20] like leaning into into Gemini\n[41:25] >> more and more now.\n[41:26] because of the heavy limits on on on\n[41:28] cloud like\n[41:29] >> oh that's why\n[41:31] >> yeah mainly\n[41:32] >> but I still don't understand your\n[41:33] workflow so you you do the thing in with\n[41:35] claw code in this repo I then when you\n[41:38] do how do you do this handover when do\n[41:40] you throw things over to Gemini\n[41:41] >> on the on the right box where you have\n[41:42] Gemini add slash um entropic or slash\n[41:47] son\n[41:48] >> oh okay\n[41:51] okay\n[41:53] So\n[41:55] yeah, so how do I do the handover? Opus\n[41:58] creates all of the beats I choose. As\n[42:00] you saw, I have a huge dependency tree\n[42:02] of how they link to each other. Every\n[42:04] single\n[42:05] >> it's is broken down in one epic that has\n[42:08] multiple phases which are the features\n[42:10] and then within the feature there's like\n[42:12] actual task. So the epic and the feature\n[42:15] they have just general description but\n[42:17] each individual task has a design\n[42:20] section which says like what we are\n[42:22] doing um sorry the description is what\n[42:25] we are doing the design is how we are\n[42:27] doing it and the acceptance criteria is\n[42:28] what we want to verify right then maybe\n[42:31] some notes and then definitely using\n[42:32] using comments for any divergence while\n[42:34] you do the work\n[42:37] yeah so it's description design\n[42:41] >> no oh sorry description I think\n[42:44] description is what?\n[42:45] >> Oh yeah. Why? What? And why?\n[42:48] >> Yeah. [snorts]\n[42:50] >> How?\n[42:51] >> And then acceptance criteria.\n[42:53] >> Yeah. But okay. So\n[42:58] >> what Opus creates and and ultimately\n[43:02] what needs to be closed are the tasks\n[43:04] that contain those sections. So that's\n[43:06] the context for\n[43:08] 4.5.\n[43:09] >> So you Okay. So you get the card and\n[43:11] then and then you throw it on here.\n[43:13] Okay. Can I just replay how I think what\n[43:15] you're telling me? You you have a a\n[43:18] planning repository and then you use BD\n[43:20] to coordinate uh your tasks.\n[43:23] >> I have a mono rep. So it's it's all in\n[43:25] the same repository.\n[43:26] >> Oh okay. It's all in the same\n[43:28] >> when I talked about different repos. I'm\n[43:30] talking about different task completely\n[43:32] not shared beats task.\n[43:34] >> Okay.\n[43:37] So I you're just using Gemini just\n[43:39] because it's it's cheap, right? And it's\n[43:41] got and it's got more context, doesn't\n[43:43] it?\n[43:44] >> Yeah. Um and\n[43:48] it's smart. It's like almost opus smart,\n[43:50] right? But I'm afraid it doesn't follow\n[43:53] the instructions.\n[43:55] I don't know why. It's it's ridiculous.\n[43:57] it just because like I felt like I want\n[43:59] to get this done and I don't want to\n[44:01] take like exactly what we earlier you as\n[44:04] like can we do some benchmark and some\n[44:05] evals and some some figuring out things\n[44:08] I was like yes I want to do that but I\n[44:10] want to get this thing done like now\n[44:12] it's Tuesday and I want to get it done\n[44:14] by tomorrow so I'm like I'm not just\n[44:17] doing\n[44:18] >> there's been so many like weird little\n[44:19] instances where I feel AI\n[44:22] was just immature or not listening to me\n[44:25] or did its own thing. It's It's\n[44:27] hilarious. It's kind of It's\n[44:29] >> the thing about Gemini. Gemini is very\n[44:32] literal. So, I'm afraid that if I\n[44:34] haven't if I have made a mistake in the\n[44:36] description of design or a capsson\n[44:37] criteria, I'm afraid Gemini will just\n[44:40] not do it right. And I feel that Son is\n[44:42] doing more of what I expected to do.\n[44:45] >> Yeah. Interesting.\n[44:47] >> So, when I care about it, I ask Son. If\n[44:50] I don't care about it, I ask Gemini.\n[44:52] Like, I don't care how, just make it\n[44:54] work.\n[44:56] Okay, I got to I got to do my kids drop\n[44:58] off now.\n[44:59] Um, so\n[45:01] >> cuz you wanted to talk about AI\n[45:02] annoyances, but then\n[45:03] >> Yeah. Did you read this blog? Did I\n[45:04] share it with you?\n[45:06] >> I don't think you did.\n[45:08] >> Have a look. I don't know if you're\n[45:10] going to be around. I'm going to I have\n[45:11] to do my kids drop off and then uh then\n[45:13] maybe we can resume.\n[45:16] Hopefully I have a chill morning.\n[45:19] >> My budget doesn't reset for another\n[45:21] hour. [laughter] So, I'm watching you\n[45:24] YouTube. I went to the gym. So, this was\n[45:26] part of my my comment reply because\n[45:28] people are always complaining about\n[45:29] like, oh, these limits are horrible. I'm\n[45:31] currently not unhappy. I do not feel\n[45:33] there's a huge degradation in the amount\n[45:35] of work I can get done. Actually, I feel\n[45:37] like I get more done with the current\n[45:39] cost and limits on my on my account and\n[45:42] >> constraints are good. Constraints are\n[45:43] good.\n[45:43] >> Yeah.\n[45:44] >> Yeah. So, so I ended it a bit snarky\n[45:47] with like and if I if I hit a limit, I\n[45:50] touch your ass and you should do\n[45:52] [laughter] the same.\n[45:54] Well, I'm I'm Yeah.\n[45:56] >> Easy said when you're frustrated, right?\n[45:59] >> Okay. Um Yeah. May maybe resume in uh 20\n[46:02] minutes. See you.\n[46:04] >> Okay. See you.",

You can just you can\njust go here. But I've only got the MP3\nversion. Oh, I also just wanted to\nmention that uh if you wanted to contact\nme then Henry at uh icky.fe or canry at\nTwitter. I was I was looking at my\nemail. I couldn't actually find an email\naddress for you. You were you were at\nhonest or something like that when I was\nlooking through my email.\n>> What? You don't want to reveal your\nemail address.\nI'm just I was thinking because like the\none that I that's on my commits of my\nmain GitHub profile are it's like a very\nold Gmail that I created when I was like\n12 and I had to take like a name not 12.\nUh when was Gmail?\n>> Yeah, you can't be that young.\n>> 20. Um\nand so it's a it's a silly name. I got\nan Outlook that has my full name.\n>> Oh, for Christ's sake. I mean, and you\nyou're complaining me about using Jurro.\nWell, anyway, Jira, I'm I'm almost\nsurprised that that you don't use Jurro\nat your work. You don't use Jurro.\n[snorts]\n>> And and I think I think it's amazing\nthat like you can use AI to plan to\norganize your spreads. Like like half my\nmy job as a lead is to like chase my\ncolleagues like, \"Oh, have you updated\nyour card? Um, are you using the right\ntemplate? Have you storyointed the card?\nBlah blah blah blah blah.\n>> And and Jura is like molasses. So if I\ncan if I can sync this down to BD and\nget AI to run over it, I'm like I've\nsaved myself 3 hours in.\n>> I think it's a very clever hack. It's\nkind of a realization of the um the\nproblem with MCPS a little bit. Although\nthat your main problem was the latency\nof of managing Jira tickets and then\njust having a local very fast SQL light.\num issue tracker that then automatically\nsyncs to Jira. It's it's a clever hack.\nIt's it's really nice. Um but\nunfortunately it uh it mentions Jira. So\nby that by definition it has to\n[laughter] be\n>> it's just uh hosed. Yeah.\n>> Same same thing. I'm I'm joking with you\nabout Python, right? The moment you\nmention Python or I'm just joking I see\noh no there's Python in this.\n>> Yeah. I mean thank go I feel I feel like\nreally lucky. I feel like I'm living in\na virtual world. Like I love how AI has\ncome along and for Python the UV astral\ntools.\n>> Oh yeah, UV is amazing. UV\n>> it is such I like I wouldn't It's so\ngood. It is so good.\n>> It almost makes Python tolerable.\n>> It almost makes Python tolerable. Yeah.\nAs the whole astral stuff, all the\nAstral stuff is so good.\n>> Are we the baddies?\n[laughter]\nyou know this sketch from um\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Um I can't remember the names. [snorts]\nYeah. UV I actually I'm rolling out\nrough at work. Um hopefully I won't get\ntoo many complaints. I'm replacing It's\namazing because with the rough I'm\nreplacing like like lint black flake 8.\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> Uh\nBandit.\nI'm like replacing the the pre-commit\nhooks used to just take forever. Now\nthey're running like a millisecond. I\nmean, thank you. Thank you. Rough and\nRust and\n>> Oh, Astral. This is all Astral.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n>> Amazing. Amazing. Amazing stuff.\nsounds a bit similar to all of the work\nthat like is happening in the JavaScript\necosystem with like biome replacing\neslint and vitest replacing just um you\nknow making typescript more of a first\nuh class citizen of the of the\necosystem. I know your reaction to\nTypeScript and this is why I reacted to\nabout Python that way was like I hate\nTypeScript but to be honest\n>> to me Typescript is a breath of fresh\nair compared to just plain Java script\nand um Python. I mean\n>> okay um I mean uh\nwell did you ever come across a guy\ncalled uh TJ Holloway Chuck?\n>> No.\n>> No. Oh, TJ. I think his GitHub actions\nare quite popular. No.\n>> Yeah. I mean, he he wrote Okay, this is\na fake account.\n>> Different one.\n>> Uh,\nyeah, that's him. He kind of disappeared\nand all his projects are sort of\nmaintained by other people, but I mean\nhe wrote Express\nback in the day.\n>> Are we talking about Okay.\n>> No, I don't know why it doesn't show up\nin his repos anymore. Oh, I think it's\nnow like uh\n>> in the foundation or an orc.\n>> Yeah, something like that. But like I I\noften I mean I often sounds like I'm\ninsane, but like you know sometimes I\nget nostalgic and look at his old code\nand uh I don't think it's been\nTypescript.\nI mean it's it's like it's free of all\nthat sort of stupid annotations unless\nsomeone's uh changed it. But like I\nthought that the way I mean what I'm\ntrying to say is that I learn to write\nto write node from his code\nand every time I read his code I just\nthink it's so nice so nice this code\nand express is also one of those one of\nthose projects which which I thought was\nsomething that dragged me back into the\nNode.js world for good reasons. But like\nyeah, I mean Express is s such an\namazing project. I guess everything's\nstill kind of Expressbased, right?\n>> Mhm.\n>> I think you align with with um one of\nlike you know DHH.\n>> Yeah, DHH. Yeah. Yeah. I\nhe he's uh he's cool. He's cool. He he\nlaunched phys he launched Fizzy, which I\nthought was like kind of weird because\nyou've been talking to me about Bead's\nUIs.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. That's that's funny. I also\nsaw him mention about like issue\ntrackers. Um but in terms of his school,\nI I also I don't agree. I had this very\ndeep conversation with Chad GPT about\nattaching politics to technical\num work. For example, DHH he does\namazing projects. I don't like Ruby on\nRails, but I do like um Omari or Omari\nand I like Omar before that. And um\n>> you're not running that software. You\njust like the idea, don't you?\n>> No, no. I run I run it on my uh Windows\ndesktop and I also for new year bought a\none terabyte SSD NVME to install RP and\nall the way.\n>> That's funny cuz I bought something\nsimilar. What did you buy? Did you buy\nexactly the same one I bought?\n>> EVO Plus. I think I didn't pay break the\nbank. What is this?\n>> Yeah, I went I bought a Crucial.\n[sighs and snorts]\n>> The Samsung ones are like more\nexpensive. it. Well,\nit was a really good salesman\n[laughter] because I go to this shop in\nVietnam and Samsung is quite a popular\nrange of products in Vietnam. And in\nVietnam, you you must have you must have\na brand or quality, right? And so some\nshops, they are the official retailers.\n>> There's no returns policy. You just go\nbuy.\n>> No,\nthere is return policy actually with\nFungu. They they open the package\nnormally and they put a little warranty\nsticker but they didn't do it on this\none which is normally when you buy it\nthey put like a little sticker and they\nlike tag which but I guess today you can\ndo it with the receipt but um back in\nlike 2006 when I came to Vietnam and you\nwent you bought anything it all needed\nto be tested right in the store right\nyou don't buy anything you don't take\nanything home until you have actually\ntested it in the store and there's a\nlittle sticker added straight on the\nhardware\n>> that's cool yeah well I I I always\nremember buying light bulbs at the at\nthe hardware store in Singapore. They\nall the the lady always tested the light\nbulb before she um you know let me leave\nthe store and I'm like they would never\ndo this in England.\n>> I think this is a thing in Asia um\nbecause of like cheap knockoffs, right?\nUm and so you want to get the quality.\n>> So so with this shop where I bought it,\nyou said Samsung is the more expensive\none. probably be related to their like\num guarantees on on uh on and return\npolicies and also I've been thinking\nabout like installing Omari I use Omar\ncoup right now Ubuntu based with Gnome\nright and um I'm having some display\nissues sometimes with with Ubuntu but it\nworks great but lately I've done all my\nwork on my Mac OS but I want to go back\nto like um Linux and and so they\ncompletely pivoted to Omari so I've been\nwanting to get a new SSD drive to\ninstall it um since June because my old\nSSDs are too small as well. So when I\nwas there, I bought a router because I\nwanted to set some other like separate\nnetwork up in my house. And I was there\nand I asked him like we I saw the price\nof a desktop like a pre-made and he\nbasically told me one of the\nsalespersons there was like, \"Oh, you\ncan buy all of these components and\nbuild it for half the price. Don't buy\nthis like pre-made.\"\n>> Oh, wins when's the trust.\n>> Like Yeah, you're right. You're right.\nWhat else? What? Tell me about\n>> I just bought I just went in for a VPN\nrout um sorry a router that has VPN\nsupport and um and then I he for some\nreason I I was looking at the desktop.\nThey have these gaming desktops on on\ndisplay, right? And he made that comment\nand I was like, \"Yeah, but like memory\nand GPU right now is crazy, right?\" And\nhe's like, \"Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.\" And\nthen I was like, \"I've been wanting to\nbuy an SSD.\" And he was like, \"Oh, the\nprice is going to go up.\"\n>> And I'm like, \"What? I know memory and\nGPU is going to go up, but what about\nabout like hard hard disks? And he was\nlike, \"No, no, because in Vietnam, China\nis buying all of this. They're buying\nall the memory. They're buying all the\nGP GPU from all the neighboring\ncountries.\"\n>> Yeah. Yeah. And and because they're\nbuilding AI rigs and and so they are\n>> sense of urgency is created and the\nbuyer\n>> he immediately created the sense of\nurgency and I was like, \"Yeah, I've been\nthinking about it for for six months.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Yeah, but I haven't\nused my Ubuntu for a while.\" So I was\nlike, \"Ah, there's no urgency for me\nthere, right?\" And he was like, \"No, no,\nno. It's going to go up.\" And I was\nlike, \"Oh, okay then, [laughter]\nyou know,\n>> last well.\"\n>> And then when I check out, he looks at\nthe bill and I said, and and I'm like,\n\"Yeah, it's a bit expensive, but it's\nlike Christmas, right?\" And he's like,\n\"Yeah, but that's like half my salary.\nThat's half my monthly salary.\" And\n[laughter] I was like,\n>> \"Dude, I think you was asking for a tip.\n>> Do do you tip people in in Vietnam?\" No.\nNot in that shop, but it used to be a\nvery like uh\n>> depends if it's a bar and good someone's\ngood-looking, I suppose. Maybe.\n[laughter]\n>> Cool. Well, places. I don't know what\nyou're talking about. [laughter]\n[snorts]\n>> Well, let's see. Let me think.\nOh, okay. Let me just rattle off some\nthoughts.\nAre you using Ghosty?\nNo, but I heard that Ghosty fixes the\nscroll bug in cloud code, so I'm\nthinking about it.\n>> I switched to Ghosty and I'm loving it\nactually.\n>> Mhm.\n>> And this is Ghosty right here. Okay. Um,\ncan you see my whole screen? You can see\nit. You can see this.\n>> Yeah. And I see your duffel API key. And\nNo, I'm just kidding. [laughter]\n>> Yo, don't think I need this keybind. I'm\njust taking it off.\nYeah, I'm loving Ghosty. It's It's fast.\nUm,\n>> want to give it background like it's\nHashimoto.\n>> Oh yeah, you can project after exiting.\n>> I don't go for that whole like what do\nyou call it?\n>> Um,\n>> it's written in Zigg or Rust. Zigg,\nright?\n>> Yeah, it's fast\nand like it does like weird things which\nis I think is quite cool. Like when it\nseems to know that like it's waiting\nsometimes. I don't know how this is\nexpressed in tone language,\n>> but I'm I'm I'm loving it. I'm loving\nit. This uh and uh and Claude I I'm I'm\noften like I'm still a little bit\nconfused how to init my like how do you\ninit your project? I go get initi\nand and and then and then but then it's\nstill but then I still have to do\nsomething like um\nlike like this, right? before any is is\nthat how you set up beats or do you do\nsomething else?\n>> I have not set up beats in a new\nproject. I'm working in a fairly large\nmonor repo right now. So I just\nfine-tune whatever is there and um\n>> but what you just showed seemed to be\nlike the nice way of doing it.\n>> You still have a performance issue.\n>> Yeah, there's still a performance issue.\nI'm not too sure why. You mentioned that\nthat the demon runs or something.\nYeah. So I was on beats version 0.21 or\nsomething and there was some demon\nsocket issue or maybe in later versions\nthere was a demon socket issue. I\ndefinitely saw some um issues about\nperformance in in the GitHub repo and\npeople were saying it's a leftover demon\nsocket\n>> that need to be killed. So if you kill\nall the demons usually it solves the\nproblem.\n>> Okay, maybe you're right. I just killed\nthem all and now it's faster. [laughter]\n>> Yay.\nOkay, that's one problem solved.\n>> That's one problem with beads though,\nlike there's a new release every two\ndays. [laughter]\nUh there's a a slew of duplicate like um\ncommands because it's all AI generated.\nSo there's no consistency and it\nreintroduces bugs all the time or it\ncreates completely new bugs and then you\nget like\n>> I think I think Steve is definitely like\nnot coding. You know what I mean?\n>> Oh crap. Oh, sorry. What? [laughter]\n>> He doesn't seem to be coding. Oh yeah,\nyou showed me that pull request. Uh,\nwhich one was it?\n>> The the what was it about the ali cats\nlooking for work in the graveyard?\nAnd um it's the pole I think it's it's\nhis test. It's it's like pole cat.\nSearch for pole cat. It's not graveyard.\nIt's like junkyard.\n>> So I can't find it.\n>> Yeah, he he has some very interesting\ncommits. But um what worries me when I\nwant to update this this thing this\nbinary is that I see commits like fix uh\nfile corruption issue and all this stuff\nand I'm like wait what they have like\nfile corruption issues at\n>> point I I've had some weird merge issues\nbut I mean but but since I know that\nlike you know [snorts] since I know that\nthe source of truth is is uh this file\nhere.\nLet me go BD crate foo bar whatever.\nYeah, since I know since I know how it\nworks kind of\nuh I can go in here and fix things. But\nI'm just surprised it happens. Like I'm\nreally really surprised it happens. But\nanyway, whatever. A great find for me\nwhen I wanted to update Beats was um I\nwent through any of the UI projects that\nare going on and just a few days ago\nsomebody um created a TUI a terminal UI\nfor beats called\n>> Oh yeah, which one? Yeah, you which one\nis that?\n>> P E R L E S. It's in the root read me\nalso.\n>> P E R L E S. Well, yeah, if you go to\nthe read me. Yeah, pearls but the French\nway. Pearl. Yeah. At pearl the pear.\nBelush.\n>> It sounds dirty. Honestly,\n>> what I said was pearls for the swines.\n[laughter]\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, this one, download it, dude. Try it\nout.\n>> Oh, I thought it was a web thing.\n>> No. So I I've been using Beats UI but\nBets UI doesn't show comments on issues\nand it doesn't show uh it doesn't allow\neasy tree navigation from one issue to\nthe other and and the dependencies.\n>> It doesn't show\num\nwhat was it there was some other issues\nthat I had ah it doesn't allow me to\nfilter by labels. So, so this thing is\nif you like Jira, this seems to be the\nJira for beats. Okay, because one of the\nthings you can do is Jira is you can\nbuild your combon boards with your\ncolumns and you can doing some query\nlanguage there, right? Not that I ever\nuse Jira or or you know care about Jira,\nbut somebody told me that you can do\nthese query language um for your columns\nand your boards and your views and all\nthat, right? So, they have this BQL\nbeatsql and it's like a lexer with a\nparser. Yeah, this is a little bit\nunsettling that things have gone towards\nJura so quickly [laughter]\nlike beats it was so simple now now the\npeople are doing this\n>> but the good thing is this is all\nseparate from beats yeah you can get\nthis if you want so I I used his like\nkbon view but you can't like cross\nreference columns like if you create one\ncolumn with something and then you want\nanother column to to use something from\nthat you can't do that so if you want to\nbuild a tree of dependencies or you want\nto navigate and and he didn't seem seem\nto like have a very deeply nested uh\nbeats issue. Maybe I can show you how it\nlooks on my on my machine.\n>> The the next thing I couldn't help but\nthink is like estimation points,\nvelocity,\n>> you can see the screen.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh. Oh, how did that get up there?\n>> Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, I mean, yeah, if\nyou want to spend some time talking\nabout grid.\n>> Um, no tangent here. So,\nthat's a bit of uh crap here, but let's\nlet's maximize this view. You got to be\nable to maximize.\n>> So, here we are. Uh\n>> maybe maybe control plus a bit. I mean,\nno one's going to be able to read this\non YouTube otherwise.\n>> Oh, that's going to that's not going to\nlook good, is it?\n>> I'm going to have to control minuses a\nbit. Is that acceptable?\n>> Okay. I guess you're just showing the\naesthetics, I suppose.\n>> Yeah. So\nthis is the standard view of per\nuh if you want to pronounce it the\nFrench way and you see there's like the\nblocked the ready um the in progress and\nthe closed issues right classic I added\nanother view which is just showing the\nepics\n>> and then from an epic\n>> I go into the epic and I can see the\nfull progress of this epic so I have\nlike 57 beats tasks in this epic and I\nwish I could like narrow this column So\nthere those little symbols at the end\nmean that like the agent is is choing\ndown on it or what does it mean?\n>> Yeah. So the little check marks if you\nsee them are completed tasks and then\nthe green ones green like circles are\nthis is not yet um implemented. Actually\nthese it should be nice if there's like\nred for for blocked and and green for\nready to to pick up. Maybe that's\nsomething that we could uh request. And\nthen here we have uh the blue one here\nthe full full blue circle. You can see\nthat one is in progress, right? So, so\nyou can navigate the full dependency\ntree and\n>> when earlier the reason why I bring this\nup is because most people don't really\nhave this like deep nested uh list. I\nthink I mean if I look at my\n>> I mean at work I'm often on a jura board\nwith epic features tasks and it's it's a\nnightmare just to to go between them. I\nmean I mean there is this like chicklet\nthing but like you know how Jurro is so\nslow just just the fact that just the\nfact that you're moving between issues\nin a tree like that just\nmakes me feel unusual.\n[snorts]\n>> Don't talk about Jira. We don't talk\nabout Jira.\nSo for me like this was my main uh view\nthat I used of this beats UI which was\nlike the epics view and then when I\nwanted to look I could see like the the\nphases of each of the user stories uh\nfor this epic. So I'm working on um\nterraform state delete uh with like soft\ndelete tombstones and and then terapform\nstate rename functionality and so maybe\nagain this is an epic it should have\nbeen scoped down I don't know but um\nthis is the things I'm missing. So for\nexample, there's a user story here. When\nI click on it, I can see all of its\ndependencies. Ah, there's another thing.\nThere are design and notes here and\neverything. And then when I look at the\ndependencies,\n>> you can I have this little graph view,\nbut it's I can't click on anything and\nand it's it's not really nice.\n>> So this is where\n>> ditch that project and move to the\nterminal.\n>> Yeah. Um I I was like I was doing pull\nrequest to add the tree view but then he\nadded his own version and it was\n>> how come the issue names have like quite\nweird naming like I I thought it was\njust like now now you have AS3 3.4.12\n4.12 what?\n>> Yes. Um I noticed beats does that when\nyou create a new task that is that has a\nparent. So it will just append.1 point\ntwo parent.\n>> I I don't know because I also\n>> How come I haven't noticed that?\n>> This is after I upgraded it started\ndoing that.\n>> I see. Okay. Right.\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what happens if you move a task to\nanother feature or something or or epic?\nThen it might mess up a bit. But anyway,\n>> move task. Tasks are not open long\nenough to move things around, bro.\n>> Yay.\n>> Right now, I created this whole tree\nyesterday with Opus 4 and I've completed\n50% of it. Um, this morning, okay, so\nthat was we talked a little bit about\nlike beats issue management and your uh\nsynchronization. There's quite a few\nchanges in in AI land as well like cloud\njust released something called resumable\nagents. So if you prompt cloud and tell\nit to send the agent to the background\nthen that agent becomes resumable which\nis like a very early way of um you know\nbefore when you when you say like hey\nspawn three sub agents to do a task they\nspawn they complete and then you know\nthey're dead.\n>> So it sounds like you can get the\ncontext back if you wanted to pick it\nup.\n>> That's that seems to be the goal. um it\nwas on Reddit and people were saying\nabout this\n>> because in my mind BD is the is the key\nbecause it keeps the context in a task\nright in a in a in an issue.\n>> Yeah. So if I\n>> if and I'm just like paranoid nowadays\nof using since I've been using AI so\nlong like I just don't want context to\nbe anywhere else almost except in that\ntask.\n>> Exactly. So so if we look at this task\nhere like this is a very detailed task\nright. It shows what we are trying to do\nthe goal. Then there's the acceptance\ncriteria of like we need to actually is\na mistake here. I should have design\nfirst and then acceptance criteria.\n>> Okay. Don't beat yourself up about it.\nYeah. Progressive disclosure.\n>> Yes. Um I don't like this. Um I'm I'm\ngoing to do a PR to fix this. This is my\nPR originally. He already merged it. U\nbut I I I realized it later that it was\nwrong. So anyway, um, and then the most\nimportant thing is that I want to be\nable like you just said, spawn an agent\nfrom this task or maybe from a user\nstory so that they can complete because\nthese tasks are very detailed. The most\nimportant thing is it tells exactly\nwhich file to change, right? Which is so\ncrucial um, if you want to spin up\nagents like Haiku and they don't need to\nlike explore the whole codebase, just\nkeep them focused on a little sub part.\nDefinitely if you're working on like a\nmonor repo type of thing. Yeah, I mean\nto be honest, I do that with my\ncolleagues. I say these are the in the\nin the scope section of the of a ticket.\nI say these are the the files that\nyou're going to change. You're not going\nto go anywhere else,\n>> right?\n>> I do this already with my colleagues.\n>> So, so, so, so agents with this should\nwork perfectly, right? You give them a\nsmall task, they complete it like how\nyou code completes it and then the\noverall main thread of your cloud code\nthe context is saved because it doesn't\nneed to read the whole file iterate on\nmaking the changes and then you know\nthat main context stays clean and and\nfocused on what is the overall goal and\njust coordinates the sub agents. So I\ntried earlier to say like okay there's\nsome of these tasks they are ready and\nthey can be done in parallel and spawn\ntwo agents to do it but I wanted the\nagents to confirm to me first that they\nwere doing the right thing. So I told in\nthe prompt that you sent to the agent\nmake sure to ask it to check in early\nand it came back to me um with a\ncheck-in and then I and it was like it\nasked like a lot of questions I hadn't\neven thought about and\n>> it's amazing. So it's kind of mirroring\nmy life. So basically it's it's doing a\nkickoff. It's basically asking any\nclarifying questions, right? We call\nthis a kickoff. And uh\n>> yeah. And um and then what happened is I\nsaid, \"Okay, great cloud. I heard you\nhave this resume capability. Now resume\nthose agents um but there's a bug. So\nthey don't see their initial prompt. So\nmake sure to reiterate your original\ninitial prompt and then together with\nyour um um approval of their plan and\nthen it send kick off an agent and they\ncompleted a task. But then later I asked\nit, \"Hey Cloud, do you have agent IDs?\nDo you know how to resume agents?\" And\nit was like, \"No, there are no agent\nIDs.\" No, I cannot resume. I was like,\n\"Oh, okay. So what just happened?\" Like\n>> that's really interesting. So things are\nthings are evolving quite quickly. I I\nlistened to an anthropic uh video last\nnight and\nthe emphasis with with respect to agents\nwas skills. So, I'm wondering to myself,\nhave you adopted that workflow where\nyour agents are you attach skills to\nyour agents? I believe like do you ever\ndo that\n>> I I think we saw the same YouTube about\ndon't build um don't build agents but\nbuild skills, right?\n>> Yeah. Yeah, that one. Oh, man. We're\nwe're in an echo chamber here. We're\nlike reading the same things.\n>> I saw it on on Reddit. Um, and I haven't\nbeen able to watch it because like I\nsaid, my audio is not working right now.\nI don't know.\n>> It's nothing. It's nothing too amazing\nto be honest. It was a bit is a bit\ntame, but like\n>> Yeah. So, I do have the agent skill\nhere.\n>> I mean, I have the beat skill here cuz I\ntold you how crucial the beat skill was,\nright? It It really made it really gave\nCloud the edge compared to other\n>> You haven't written your own skills yet?\n>> No. No. Nothing else. I'm also still I'm\nstill struggling to maybe I've just\nforgotten how to do it, but like like\nlike how do you like package manage\nskills? Like how do you like just bring\nskill into a project? Like like how do\nyou like isn't there like a cuz you get\nplugins but they're not the same as\nskills. So I'm a little bit confused\nlike I I want to like add Vincent's\nskill repository and get XY Z skill or\nreference that skill inside the the\nagent or something.\nUh\n>> so this is somebody that I know on\nLinkedIn. He he built some TypeScript\nproject but he wasn't at at Meta. He he\nwas asking the question how do we\npackage like create bundles to easily\ndeploy um what you said like these\ncapability like plugins are MCPs skills\nagents what how do we build these and\nand and have them\n>> like bootstrapped into into agent\nshells? Um, and then he posted on\nhackernews something called source\nwizard. Um, which is I think a project\ntrying to do this, but it has the same\nquestion as what you just asked, right?\n>> Like how do we create bug?\n>> I'm sure I'm sure Anthropic is working\non it. Like the a previous project that\nI used to be quite into was called GBT\nscript. Have you heard of that one?\n>> Let me share my script.\n>> Gib script. Um, hold on. I need to\nYou sound like eggshell from M MRC.\n>> Eggshell.\n>> Was it XL? The thing that you use for\nscripting bots on Mr. C.\n>> Um Oh, yeah. I Yeah.\nIROC. That brings me back\ntunnels bounce. I'm actually still on\nIRC. I don't know if you're on free node\nand all that sort of stuff. There is a\nrelevant QRDC comic. What's it called?\nXKDC. X KDC comic. XKCD.\n>> So I'm I'm a lot of this stuff is is\nprior R in a way like GBT script done by\nthe same guy behind Rancher Labs. Uh\nDarren uh can't remember his name.\n>> Wow. I didn't know he was doing other\nstuff cuz I used to follow him on\nTwitter.\n>> Yeah, he's he's great on Twitter. I\nbuild the cloud. So One thing about GBTS\nscript is that\nthey have this concept of of yeah tools.\nSo you have different tools and you can\nthese these in my opinion are are agents\nreally.\n>> You can you yeah you can have tools and\nthey do certain things. So you reference\nthem in your like your front matter like\nI want the random number tool. I mean\nthese are skills right and and then he\nand then they they can be packaged at\nthe end of a URL. I mean, so what I'm\ntrying to say is that I'm sure Anthropic\nare just going to like do do something\nvery similar.\n>> Yeah. MCP was kind of the goal of like\nhaving a redistributable and they put in\nthe plug-in marketplace and they're\ndefinitely going to make bundles.\n>> Yeah, they're definitely going to do\nthis. It's it's it's I guess it's\n>> and hooks.\n>> Do you know Beats now installs a hook if\nyou do Beats Doctor?\nYeah, I'm not too sure. I thought that\nwas a reason why my things were getting\nslow, but what is\n>> I don't like the hook.\n>> Yeah, like it makes Yeah, I I want to be\n>> I don't know. I'm I'm partial on it\nbecause I'm like I keep staging my work\nand then my commits are huge and the\nhook is like telling it complete the\ntask and then, you know, do the commit.\nAnd I am very reluctant to let the LLM\ncommit. I'm like heavily in the loop\nlike I want to commit to work. I I\nnoticed a tweet from you or something on\nLinkedIn about [clears throat]\nmissing a file. I honestly had the\nexperience where\nI don't know how it happened, but the\nfile I was working on got nuked while an\nagent was running in the same repo. So,\nI mean, I'm mature enough. I'm old\nenough not to delete my own files\naccidentally. So, I'm like, how did\n>> we ever old enough not to delete our own\nfiles? I just did like an hour ago.\nSo, I looked into git stash. There was\nno git stash because I would I would\nassume that the AI would be smart enough\nto stash it if if they didn't understand\nwhy why my file was hanging around and\nit wasn't there. And and and I was like\nquite\nshocked about it. But but then I\nremembered that VS Code has this local\nfile history feature.\n>> Yes, I was about to say it's amazing.\n>> And I and I managed to pick out a an old\ncopy of the file I was working. I was\nlike,\n>> \"Visual Studio Code cache is a lifesaver\nif you accidentally.\"\n>> Thank you, Visual Studio Code. Thank\nyou.\n>> It's it's if you don't know about it,\nit's it's such a surprise and it happens\nsometimes, but I I keep forgetting some\nbut it happens where you accidentally\nremove or or you want to get back to an\nolder version of a certain file and\ncache and the cache has it.\n>> So, it's really uh\n>> lifesaver. Yeah.\n>> Team VS Code. Um sadly, but truly. Hey,\nMicrosoft.\n>> So, I um yeah, so I did I was going to\nmention I didn't use I just used Beads\nand Claude to to basically roll out this\nfeature and I thought it went quite well\nand and there's there's a lot to it like\num\nlike for example, do you know about uh\nredo?\nRedo\nor just redo?\nNo, I don't. No, we do.\n>> It's kind of like a very niche uh well\nniche. It's just like an unknown make\nreplacement.\nAnd to my surprise, I didn't even like\ninstruct the AI about it. It just knew\nwhat to do. It just did it.\nSo,\n>> like it tried to see if it was on the\npath and then start using it.\n>> Well, I told it to use red do, but it it\nknows how to write the language.\nAh\n>> and and uh I I just wanted to mention\nthat like while I was developing that\npodcast uh cache that it wrote all these\nredo files like perfectly. it understood\nthe principles because the the principle\nof redo is that it's like make you have\na target\n>> and the way that you use standard out\nand standard error um sort of\ncontributes to how the that particular\nthing gets created like it has this\nconcept of different uh named uh I don't\nknow what you call these things\n>> arguments positional arguments\n[snorts]\n>> so\nso basically when it um yeah it. And the\ncool thing about redo is is unlike make\nwhich is no one can ever write a script\ninside make because of the weird\nescaping that you have to make. You just\nwrite it in shell.\n>> But with the with these paradigms of\nusing these name things, then you\nreplicate the whole make target type\nstuff. So if you want to if if you're\nmissing uh you know fubar.mpp3,\nit knows exactly how to make it.\n>> Okay.\nYeah, I was I was I was impressed that\nit was able just to go go with it. And\nuh so I didn't use uh I didn't use\nspecit. I just basically said I want\nthis this this and this that done and it\ndid it. And I was like wow\n>> do I need I still need to learn specit.\n>> So somebody on on on Reddit was like\nwhat is your guys what is your workflow?\nAnd his workflow was like I use cloud\nyou know client like the the desktop\ncloud code not cloud CLI the the cloud\nuh client desktop\n>> desktop client sheesh I can't speak he\nuses that and then he just um you know\ngets the prompts to put them into cloud\ncode and then basically copy paste\nbetween them and that's how I started\nwith chatgbt right and that's where I I\nI I said like speckit is\n>> yeah that's true like there's different\nlike levels of maturities\nAnd most like 99% of my colleagues are\nstill sit in chat GBT UI type thing.\nYeah.\n>> Which is fine. Like I like what my reply\nbasically to him was like for my large\nproject I use the spec kit flows because\nit kind of um removes all of that copy\npaste and it helps me like I showed you\nthe task. They're very like limited\n[clears throat] to exactly what you need\nto change where. So, we got this grand\ndesign like with Opus. It's like a big\nto-do list, but instead you can break it\ndown into small little cloud sessions\nthat are focused on the individual\nfiles.\n>> If you have Yeah.\n>> If you have a really big project, you\ncan go to that level, but like it takes\na day to do that. Like I said, it I used\nto tell you like it's like 60% of the\ntime I'm doing this and then I was\nsaying 70% of the remaining time, which\nis of course.\n>> Yeah. So, like I think the way I\nprompted it was like I think I started\nwith an epic\num or maybe two epics. And yeah, I guess\nthe beautiful thing here is that we can\nlook I don't know if you checked in your\nyourjson\nL, but like I guess one thing we can\nlook forward to doing in the future is\nlike is like seeing which you know going\nthrough the tasks and seeing which ones\ngot completed well and then and then\nmaybe studying studying the description\nto see, you know, what's working and\nwhat's not working, you know, like\nthis is not very this is not very\nreadable, but I was I was hoping that\nyou and I could just say or you could\nsay, \"Kai, you're a genius for\nprompting.\"\n>> Uh,\n>> so what I was I I had the thought today\nthat I I should try this, I should try\nthat because I'm trying to fix this sub\nagent problem and every time I try it,\nit like spawn an agent and then no 50/50\ncoin toss, maybe it does the thing I\nwant and then it uses all my tokens and\nthen I'm not happy. Um, so, so yes, I\nwant to spend more time on that, but I\nalso want to just complete the task.\nLike I just had Opus generate all the\ntasks and I was like, now it should be\nfine to let Gemini do everything and it\nsave all of my clock.\n>> That resonates a lot with me because I I\nmean that's my\n>> I don't do it\n>> because I'm going to waste because\nGemini is going to give me something and\nmaybe some of it works, maybe some of it\ndoesn't and I don't trust it. So I'm\nlike right now I'm not going to do that.\nSo, it's you need to find like if you\nwant to do this, you need to dedicate a\nbudget to it because it's going to cost\nmoney. You need to budget dedicate time\nand you need to build your benchmarks\nand your evolves and you need to do it\nproperly.\n>> It's it's a whole job. And\n>> I was I was going to say that like you\nlike half of me wants to get the thing\ndone and then half of me wants to to to\nto do a retro to to see what worked and\nwhat didn't work. to to make sure that\nlike I have that feeling that I learned\nsomething because because yeah I mean\n>> I want I want to build and I want to\nlearn from the build all the time\n>> because I'm very religiously asking the\nevery time that a task was not correct I\nask it to record the problems as\ncomments on the task. So supposedly the\nJSONL that I have should clearly\nindicate that uh here we had a\ndivergence here we have a divergence and\nit should clearly highlight the problems\nbut there's so many dimensions in terms\nof like the overall scope of the project\nlike why diverge\n>> it's very hard um to so so my approach\ntoday is I try it I give it a good go\nhow far how much com how comfortable I\nam in terms of time and in terms of\nrectifying the output\nI don't want to throw away the work. I\nthink the right way would be to just\nlike, oh, I throw away a lot of that\nwork and I start again. Um, so I don't I\ndon't do that right now. And so,\n>> yeah, I'm I'm Yeah, I that whole\nthrowaway thing doesn't make sense to\nme. Like I'm I'm always just picking up\nthe pieces. Oh, did you see my my blog\nabout Sorry to change the topic. AI\nannoyances. I don't know if any of these\nresonated with you\n>> before before we go there because you\nasked about the workflows and I\nmentioned about the Reddit comment about\nthe copy pasting and then using spec\nkit. What I wanted to say was at the end\nof my comment I realized that actually a\nlot of the time I'm just asking Gemini\ntree and I have to like say I constantly\nflip-flop between them. But today I have\ncloud code as my main like big project\nworkhorse and then I have Gemini tree\nfor I don't care what you do. this is\nthe problem I see, fix it. And it just\ngoes and does, you know, goes off and\nthen I check in. Sometimes I do the make\ntest. I do the make build and if it\nworks, I'm happy. I don't care about the\ncode because that was basically my\nconclusion. Um, and then like I don't\nknow if that makes sense. So you don't\nlet me just write this down. So\nbasically right now you're using using\nClaude I don't know son 4.5 whatever,\nright? or you're using Opus whatever\nyou're just using claw code\n>> and then what and then I I didn't quite\nunderstand how you you throw it over to\nGemini Gemini 3 pro pro right yeah so on\nthe project that I'm currently using\ncloud code I wanted to use Gemini but I\ndecided not to and I have like three\nother repos that I'm doing at the same\ntime so on one side I'm adding an API\nnew functionality on the other side I\nhave a completely separate repository\nand binary that consumes the SDK Okay,\nI'm I'm saying like hey uh we need to\nstart doing this and that and then I ask\nthat Gemini and I don't do speckit. I\ndon't do anything. It's like I don't\ncare about that project.\n>> So but I'm I'm just what do you ask\nGemini to just to review the task? I\ndon't quite understand what\n>> no complete separate. So one one\nrepository I use cloud code opus 4.5\ncreate and specit broken down by tasks\nand it's a large monor repo across many\nfiles. uh and and and I the goal is to\nhave Son or Gemini 3 do the actual\nimplementation but today I and I find it\nvery silly because Sun 4.5 and Gemini 3\nto me are no different. So I I should be\nable to trust Gemini 3 for that project\nbut I don't and I do trust Gemini\neverywhere else like no specitate\nnothing Gemini you're more you're more\nlike leaning into into Gemini\n>> more and more now.\nbecause of the heavy limits on on on\ncloud like\n>> oh that's why\n>> yeah mainly\n>> but I still don't understand your\nworkflow so you you do the thing in with\nclaw code in this repo I then when you\ndo how do you do this handover when do\nyou throw things over to Gemini\n>> on the on the right box where you have\nGemini add slash um entropic or slash\nson\n>> oh okay\nokay\nSo\nyeah, so how do I do the handover? Opus\ncreates all of the beats I choose. As\nyou saw, I have a huge dependency tree\nof how they link to each other. Every\nsingle\n>> it's is broken down in one epic that has\nmultiple phases which are the features\nand then within the feature there's like\nactual task. So the epic and the feature\nthey have just general description but\neach individual task has a design\nsection which says like what we are\ndoing um sorry the description is what\nwe are doing the design is how we are\ndoing it and the acceptance criteria is\nwhat we want to verify right then maybe\nsome notes and then definitely using\nusing comments for any divergence while\nyou do the work\nyeah so it's description design\n>> no oh sorry description I think\ndescription is what?\n>> Oh yeah. Why? What? And why?\n>> Yeah. [snorts]\n>> How?\n>> And then acceptance criteria.\n>> Yeah. But okay. So\n>> what Opus creates and and ultimately\nwhat needs to be closed are the tasks\nthat contain those sections. So that's\nthe context for\n4.5.\n>> So you Okay. So you get the card and\nthen and then you throw it on here.\nOkay. Can I just replay how I think what\nyou're telling me? You you have a a\nplanning repository and then you use BD\nto coordinate uh your tasks.\n>> I have a mono rep. So it's it's all in\nthe same repository.\n>> Oh okay. It's all in the same\n>> when I talked about different repos. I'm\ntalking about different task completely\nnot shared beats task.\n>> Okay.\nSo I you're just using Gemini just\nbecause it's it's cheap, right? And it's\ngot and it's got more context, doesn't\nit?\n>> Yeah. Um and\nit's smart. It's like almost opus smart,\nright? But I'm afraid it doesn't follow\nthe instructions.\nI don't know why. It's it's ridiculous.\nit just because like I felt like I want\nto get this done and I don't want to\ntake like exactly what we earlier you as\nlike can we do some benchmark and some\nevals and some some figuring out things\nI was like yes I want to do that but I\nwant to get this thing done like now\nit's Tuesday and I want to get it done\nby tomorrow so I'm like I'm not just\ndoing\n>> there's been so many like weird little\ninstances where I feel AI\nwas just immature or not listening to me\nor did its own thing. It's It's\nhilarious. It's kind of It's\n>> the thing about Gemini. Gemini is very\nliteral. So, I'm afraid that if I\nhaven't if I have made a mistake in the\ndescription of design or a capsson\ncriteria, I'm afraid Gemini will just\nnot do it right. And I feel that Son is\ndoing more of what I expected to do.\n>> Yeah. Interesting.\n>> So, when I care about it, I ask Son. If\nI don't care about it, I ask Gemini.\nLike, I don't care how, just make it\nwork.\nOkay, I got to I got to do my kids drop\noff now.\nUm, so\n>> cuz you wanted to talk about AI\nannoyances, but then\n>> Yeah. Did you read this blog? Did I\nshare it with you?\n>> I don't think you did.\n>> Have a look. I don't know if you're\ngoing to be around. I'm going to I have\nto do my kids drop off and then uh then\nmaybe we can resume.\nHopefully I have a chill morning.\n>> My budget doesn't reset for another\nhour. [laughter] So, I'm watching you\nYouTube. I went to the gym. So, this was\npart of my my comment reply because\npeople are always complaining about\nlike, oh, these limits are horrible. I'm\ncurrently not unhappy. I do not feel\nthere's a huge degradation in the amount\nof work I can get done. Actually, I feel\nlike I get more done with the current\ncost and limits on my on my account and\n>> constraints are good. Constraints are\ngood.\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah. So, so I ended it a bit snarky\nwith like and if I if I hit a limit, I\ntouch your ass and you should do\n[laughter] the same.\nWell, I'm I'm Yeah.\n>> Easy said when you're frustrated, right?\n>> Okay. Um Yeah. May maybe resume in uh 20\nminutes. See you.\n>> Okay. See you.\n\nSlide timeline (transcript excerpts):\n[slide:1] [0:00–4:00]\nYeah. Well, anyway, I thought I should do some housekeeping because I I you know, I got serious. I got I got I went with Claude and I created a a podcast. >> So, I wanted to mention that this podcast should be available on Apple as well as uh Spotify as well as, you know, you don't have to subscribe anywhere. You can just you can just go here. But I've only got the MP3 version. Oh, I also just wanted to mention that uh if you wanted to contact me then Henry at uh icky.fe or canry at Twitter. I was I was looking at my email. I couldn't actually find an email address for you. You were you were at honest or something like that when I was looking through my email. >> What? You don't want to reveal your email address. I'm just I was thinking because like the one that I that's on my commits of my main GitHub profile are it's like a very old Gmail that I created when I was like 12 and I had to take like a name not 12. Uh when was Gmail? >> Yeah, you can't be that young. >> 20. Um and so it's a it's a silly name. I got an Outlook that has my full name. >> Oh, for Christ's sake. I mean, and you you're complaining me about using Jurro. Well, anyway, Jira, I'm I'm almost surprised that that you don't use Jurro at your work. You don't use Jurro. [snorts] >> And and I think I think it's amazing that like you can use AI to plan to organize your spreads. Like like half my my job as a lead is to like chase my colleagues like, \"Oh, have you updated your card? Um, are you using the right template? Have you storyointed the card? Blah blah blah blah blah. >> And and Jura is like molasses. So if I can if I can sync this down to BD and get AI to run over it, I'm like I've saved myself 3 hours in. >> I think it's a very clever hack. It's kind of a realization of the um the problem with MCPS a little bit. Although that your main problem was the latency of of managing Jira tickets and then just having a local very fast SQL light. um issue tracker that then automatically syncs to Jira. It's it's a clever hack. It's it's really nice. Um but unfortunately it uh it mentions Jira. So by that by definition it has to [laughter] be >> it's just uh hosed. Yeah. >> Same same thing. I'm I'm joking with you about Python, right? The moment you mention Python or I'm just joking I see oh no there's Python in this. >> Yeah. I mean thank go I feel I feel like really lucky. I feel like I'm living in a virtual world. Like I love how AI has come along and for Python the UV astral tools. >> Oh yeah,…\n\n[slide:2] [3:40–11:41]\nhooks used to just take forever. Now they're running like a millisecond. I mean, thank you. Thank you. Rough and Rust and >> Oh, Astral. This is all Astral. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Amazing. Amazing. Amazing stuff. sounds a bit similar to all of the work that like is happening in the JavaScript ecosystem with like biome replacing eslint and vitest replacing just um you know making typescript more of a first uh class citizen of the of the ecosystem. I know your reaction to TypeScript and this is why I reacted to about Python that way was like I hate TypeScript but to be honest >> to me Typescript is a breath of fresh air compared to just plain Java script and um Python. I mean >> okay um I mean uh well did you ever come across a guy called uh TJ Holloway Chuck? >> No. >> No. Oh, TJ. I think his GitHub actions are quite popular. No. >> Yeah. I mean, he he wrote Okay, this is a fake account. >> Different one. >> Uh, yeah, that's him. He kind of disappeared and all his projects are sort of maintained by other people, but I mean he wrote Express back in the day. >> Are we talking about Okay. >> No, I don't know why it doesn't show up in his repos anymore. Oh, I think it's now like uh >> in the foundation or an orc. >> Yeah, something like that. But like I I often I mean I often sounds like I'm insane, but like you know sometimes I get nostalgic and look at his old code and uh I don't think it's been Typescript. I mean it's it's like it's free of all that sort of stupid annotations unless someone's uh changed it. But like I thought that the way I mean what I'm trying to say is that I learn to write to write node from his code and every time I read his code I just think it's so nice so nice this code and express is also one of those one of those projects which which I thought was something that dragged me back into the Node.js world for good reasons. But like yeah, I mean Express is s such an amazing project. I guess everything's still kind of Expressbased, right? >> Mhm. >> I think you align with with um one of like you know DHH. >> Yeah, DHH. Yeah. Yeah. I he he's uh he's cool. He's cool. He he launched phys he launched Fizzy, which I thought was like kind of weird because you've been talking to me about Bead's UIs. >> Yeah. Yeah. That's that's funny. I also saw him mention about like issue trackers. Um but in terms of his school, I I also I don't agree. I had this very deep conversation with Chad GPT about attaching politics to technical um work. For example,…\n\n[slide:3] [11:20–19:22]\ngood-looking, I suppose. Maybe. [laughter] >> Cool. Well, places. I don't know what you're talking about. [laughter] [snorts] >> Well, let's see. Let me think. Oh, okay. Let me just rattle off some thoughts. Are you using Ghosty? No, but I heard that Ghosty fixes the scroll bug in cloud code, so I'm thinking about it. >> I switched to Ghosty and I'm loving it actually. >> Mhm. >> And this is Ghosty right here. Okay. Um, can you see my whole screen? You can see it. You can see this. >> Yeah. And I see your duffel API key. And No, I'm just kidding. [laughter] >> Yo, don't think I need this keybind. I'm just taking it off. Yeah, I'm loving Ghosty. It's It's fast. Um, >> want to give it background like it's Hashimoto. >> Oh yeah, you can project after exiting. >> I don't go for that whole like what do you call it? >> Um, >> it's written in Zigg or Rust. Zigg, right? >> Yeah, it's fast and like it does like weird things which is I think is quite cool. Like when it seems to know that like it's waiting sometimes. I don't know how this is expressed in tone language, >> but I'm I'm I'm loving it. I'm loving it. This uh and uh and Claude I I'm I'm often like I'm still a little bit confused how to init my like how do you init your project? I go get initi and and and then and then but then it's still but then I still have to do something like um like like this, right? before any is is that how you set up beats or do you do something else? >> I have not set up beats in a new project. I'm working in a fairly large monor repo right now. So I just fine-tune whatever is there and um >> but what you just showed seemed to be like the nice way of doing it. >> You still have a performance issue. >> Yeah, there's still a performance issue. I'm not too sure why. You mentioned that that the demon runs or something. Yeah. So I was on beats version 0.21 or something and there was some demon socket issue or maybe in later versions there was a demon socket issue. I definitely saw some um issues about performance in in the GitHub repo and people were saying it's a leftover demon socket >> that need to be killed. So if you kill all the demons usually it solves the problem. >> Okay, maybe you're right. I just killed them all and now it's faster. [laughter] >> Yay. Okay, that's one problem solved. >> That's one problem with beads though, like there's a new release every two days. [laughter] Uh there's a a slew of duplicate like um commands because it's all AI generated. So there's no…\n\n[slide:4] [19:01–27:03]\nepics >> and then from an epic >> I go into the epic and I can see the full progress of this epic so I have like 57 beats tasks in this epic and I wish I could like narrow this column So there those little symbols at the end mean that like the agent is is choing down on it or what does it mean? >> Yeah. So the little check marks if you see them are completed tasks and then the green ones green like circles are this is not yet um implemented. Actually these it should be nice if there's like red for for blocked and and green for ready to to pick up. Maybe that's something that we could uh request. And then here we have uh the blue one here the full full blue circle. You can see that one is in progress, right? So, so you can navigate the full dependency tree and >> when earlier the reason why I bring this up is because most people don't really have this like deep nested uh list. I think I mean if I look at my >> I mean at work I'm often on a jura board with epic features tasks and it's it's a nightmare just to to go between them. I mean I mean there is this like chicklet thing but like you know how Jurro is so slow just just the fact that just the fact that you're moving between issues in a tree like that just makes me feel unusual. [snorts] >> Don't talk about Jira. We don't talk about Jira. So for me like this was my main uh view that I used of this beats UI which was like the epics view and then when I wanted to look I could see like the the phases of each of the user stories uh for this epic. So I'm working on um terraform state delete uh with like soft delete tombstones and and then terapform state rename functionality and so maybe again this is an epic it should have been scoped down I don't know but um this is the things I'm missing. So for example, there's a user story here. When I click on it, I can see all of its dependencies. Ah, there's another thing. There are design and notes here and everything. And then when I look at the dependencies, >> you can I have this little graph view, but it's I can't click on anything and and it's it's not really nice. >> So this is where >> ditch that project and move to the terminal. >> Yeah. Um I I was like I was doing pull request to add the tree view but then he added his own version and it was >> how come the issue names have like quite weird naming like I I thought it was just like now now you have AS3 3.4.12 4.12 what? >> Yes. Um I noticed beats does that when you create a new task that is that has a…\n\n[slide:5] [26:42–34:44]\nsaid, my audio is not working right now. I don't know. >> It's nothing. It's nothing too amazing to be honest. It was a bit is a bit tame, but like >> Yeah. So, I do have the agent skill here. >> I mean, I have the beat skill here cuz I told you how crucial the beat skill was, right? It It really made it really gave Cloud the edge compared to other >> You haven't written your own skills yet? >> No. No. Nothing else. I'm also still I'm still struggling to maybe I've just forgotten how to do it, but like like like how do you like package manage skills? Like how do you like just bring skill into a project? Like like how do you like isn't there like a cuz you get plugins but they're not the same as skills. So I'm a little bit confused like I I want to like add Vincent's skill repository and get XY Z skill or reference that skill inside the the agent or something. Uh >> so this is somebody that I know on LinkedIn. He he built some TypeScript project but he wasn't at at Meta. He he was asking the question how do we package like create bundles to easily deploy um what you said like these capability like plugins are MCPs skills agents what how do we build these and and and have them >> like bootstrapped into into agent shells? Um, and then he posted on hackernews something called source wizard. Um, which is I think a project trying to do this, but it has the same question as what you just asked, right? >> Like how do we create bug? >> I'm sure I'm sure Anthropic is working on it. Like the a previous project that I used to be quite into was called GBT script. Have you heard of that one? >> Let me share my script. >> Gib script. Um, hold on. I need to You sound like eggshell from M MRC. >> Eggshell. >> Was it XL? The thing that you use for scripting bots on Mr. C. >> Um Oh, yeah. I Yeah. IROC. That brings me back tunnels bounce. I'm actually still on IRC. I don't know if you're on free node and all that sort of stuff. There is a relevant QRDC comic. What's it called? XKDC. X KDC comic. XKCD. >> So I'm I'm a lot of this stuff is is prior R in a way like GBT script done by the same guy behind Rancher Labs. Uh Darren uh can't remember his name. >> Wow. I didn't know he was doing other stuff cuz I used to follow him on Twitter. >> Yeah, he's he's great on Twitter. I build the cloud. So One thing about GBTS script is that they have this concept of of yeah tools. So you have different tools and you can these these in my opinion are are agents really. >> You can you yeah…\n\n[slide:6] [34:23–39:04]\ndid it. And I was like wow >> do I need I still need to learn specit. >> So somebody on on on Reddit was like what is your guys what is your workflow? And his workflow was like I use cloud you know client like the the desktop cloud code not cloud CLI the the cloud uh client desktop >> desktop client sheesh I can't speak he uses that and then he just um you know gets the prompts to put them into cloud code and then basically copy paste between them and that's how I started with chatgbt right and that's where I I I I said like speckit is >> yeah that's true like there's different like levels of maturities And most like 99% of my colleagues are still sit in chat GBT UI type thing. Yeah. >> Which is fine. Like I like what my reply basically to him was like for my large project I use the spec kit flows because it kind of um removes all of that copy paste and it helps me like I showed you the task. They're very like limited [clears throat] to exactly what you need to change where. So, we got this grand design like with Opus. It's like a big to-do list, but instead you can break it down into small little cloud sessions that are focused on the individual files. >> If you have Yeah. >> If you have a really big project, you can go to that level, but like it takes a day to do that. Like I said, it I used to tell you like it's like 60% of the time I'm doing this and then I was saying 70% of the remaining time, which is of course. >> Yeah. So, like I think the way I prompted it was like I think I started with an epic um or maybe two epics. And yeah, I guess the beautiful thing here is that we can look I don't know if you checked in your yourjson L, but like I guess one thing we can look forward to doing in the future is like is like seeing which you know going through the tasks and seeing which ones got completed well and then and then maybe studying studying the description to see, you know, what's working and what's not working, you know, like this is not very this is not very readable, but I was I was hoping that you and I could just say or you could say, \"Kai, you're a genius for prompting.\" >> Uh, >> so what I was I I had the thought today that I I should try this, I should try that because I'm trying to fix this sub agent problem and every time I try it, it like spawn an agent and then no 50/50 coin toss, maybe it does the thing I want and then it uses all my…\n</content>\n",

  "summary": "This technical discussion explores the evolving landscape of AI-driven development, specifically focusing on the Beads (BD) issue tracker and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into daily coding workflows. The speakers examine how local, high-performance tools are replacing sluggish enterprise software and how \"agentic\" workflows are shifting from simple chat interfaces to structured, multi-step processes. By leveraging tools like Claude and Gemini alongside specialized utilities, developers are finding new ways to manage complexity in large monorepos while maintaining high velocity.\n\n[slide:1]\n## Solving the Jira Latency Problem\nThe conversation begins with a critique of traditional project management tools, specifically Jira, which is described as being as slow as molasses. To circumvent the latency and friction of web-based enterprise software, the developers discuss a \"clever hack\" involving Beads (BD), a local issue tracker powered by SQLite. This system allows for a fast, local-first experience that can automatically sync back to Jira, effectively acting as a high-performance cache for task management. By moving the issue-tracking workflow to a local environment, developers can use AI to analyze and organize sprints without the overhead of a browser-based UI. This approach saves hours of manual effort typically spent chasing colleagues for card updates or template compliance. The speakers emphasize that the primary goal is to reduce the friction between having an idea and documenting it as a trackable task.\n*Jura is like molasses. So if I can if I can sync this down to BD and get AI to run over it, I've saved myself 3 hours.*\n\n[slide:2]\n## Modern Tooling and Ecosystem Shifts\nThe discussion shifts to the rapid evolution of development tools in the Python and JavaScript ecosystems. The speakers praise the Astral suite, particularly UV and Ruff, for making Python development significantly more tolerable. Ruff is highlighted for its extreme speed, replacing multiple legacy tools like Black, Flake8, and Bandit with a single Rust-based binary that runs in milliseconds. This mirrors trends in the JavaScript world where Biome is replacing ESLint and Vitest is replacing Jest. There is a shared appreciation for clean, readable code, with a nostalgic look back at the work of TJ Hollowaychuk and the original Express framework. The speakers also touch upon the influence of DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson) and the tension between technical excellence and the political or philosophical stances often attached to software projects. They conclude that while they may disagree with certain philosophies, the quality of the underlying technical work remains the primary draw.\n\n[slide:3]\n## Hardware Constraints and Terminal Performance\nA segment of the conversation focuses on the physical hardware supporting these AI workflows. One speaker recounts purchasing a high-end Samsung NVMe SSD in Vietnam, noting a \"sense of urgency\" created by high demand for AI-related hardware in neighboring regions. This hardware upgrade is intended to support a transition back to Linux-based environments like Umari. On the software side, the Ghosty terminal is recommended for its speed and its ability to fix specific scrolling bugs encountered in other environments. The developers also troubleshoot performance issues within the Beads system itself, identifying leftover daemon sockets as a common cause of slowdowns. They note that because Beads is heavily AI-generated, it experiences a rapid release cycle—sometimes every two days—which leads to a slew of duplicate commands and occasional regressions or file corruption issues that require manual intervention in the underlying source files.\n\n[slide:4]\n## Advanced Issue Tracking with Pearls\nThe speakers dive into \"Pearls\" (or Perles), a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for Beads that offers a more robust experience than the standard web UI. Pearls allows for sophisticated navigation of deeply nested task trees and dependencies, which is essential for managing complex \"epics.\" Unlike standard Kanban boards that struggle with cross-referencing, this TUI enables developers to visualize the full progress of an epic across dozens of sub-tasks. The system uses a specialized query language called BQL (Beads Query Language), which includes a lexer and parser to handle complex views. While there is some irony in a \"simple\" tool quickly adopting the complexity of the enterprise software it seeks to replace, the speakers argue that the local-first, terminal-based nature of Pearls makes it far more efficient for power users. They specifically highlight the utility of seeing \"check-ins\" from AI agents directly within the task tree.\n\n[slide:5]\n## The Rise of Resumable AI Agents\nA major theme is the transition from static LLM prompts to dynamic, resumable agents. The speakers discuss Claude's new capabilities that allow agents to be sent to the background and resumed later, preserving context across sessions. This is seen as a critical step toward true agentic workflows where a \"main\" agent can spawn sub-agents to handle specific, parallelizable tasks. The conversation references Anthropic's recent emphasis on \"skills\" rather than just \"agents,\" suggesting that the future of AI integration lies in attaching specific capabilities to models rather than treating them as general-purpose chat bots. They discuss the need for better package management for these skills, similar to how MCP (Model Context Protocol) or GPT-script attempts to bundle capabilities. The goal is to create a system where an agent can be given a highly detailed task—including specific files to modify—and execute it with minimal supervision.\n\n[slide:6]\n## Optimizing AI Workflows and Benchmarking\nThe final section details practical strategies for balancing cost, speed, and accuracy when using multiple AI models. One developer describes a workflow where Claude Opus is used for high-level planning and task generation due to its superior reasoning, while cheaper models like Gemini or Claude Sonnet are used for the actual implementation. This \"spec-kit\" approach involves breaking down a large project into a detailed to-do list where each task includes a description, design, and acceptance criteria. By providing agents with a narrow scope and specific file targets, developers can prevent \"context drift\" and ensure the AI remains focused. The speakers admit that while they want to automate everything, they still maintain a \"human-in-the-loop\" approach for commits to avoid accidental file deletions or poor-quality code. They emphasize the importance of a \"retro\" process to learn which prompts and task structures yield the best results.\n*I'm very religiously asking the every time that a task was not correct I ask it to record the problems as comments on the task.*"
