A re-occuring problem I have had with computers is encodings.  As an English speaker I have not need anything except ASCII, but all the same it is annoying when I can't read some Korean spam.

So on my system I have changed some things:
 sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

My bash locale is now"
 hendry@bilbo:/tmp$ printenv | grep -i utf
 LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8
 LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
 LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8

I've added a couple of lines to my editor config .vimrc
 set encoding=utf-8
 set fileencoding=utf-8

And my mailer mutt (mutt-utf8 package in Debian!) config .muttrc
 set charset="utf-8"

In Gnome's preferred applications(under desktop preferences -> advanced) for Terminal I've put uxterm.

Update: Don't use Gnome. Use something like Ion instead, and setup the terminal emulator system wide, like so:

 sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator
