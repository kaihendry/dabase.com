Copy in the files from /etc/X11/ion2 to your homedir:

 $ tree .ion2/
 .ion2/
 |-- default-session--0
 |   |-- query_history.lua
 |   `-- workspaces.lua
 |-- dock.lua
 |-- ion-bindings.lua
 `-- ion.lua
 1 directory, 5 files

Then edit there.
default-session--0 seems to be maintained by Ion. But this is precarious on my system, because I always `sudo init 0` to shut down and I don't think it has the opportunity to save my settings.

In:
/home/hendry/.ion2/default-session--0/workspaces.lua amongst some awful syntax is some "WIonWS".
I named the last one I saw "web".

In ~/.ion2/ion.lua I added the winprop:

 winprop {
    class = "Firefox-bin", 
    instance = "Gecko",
    target = "web"
 }

I got the class and instance settings by running in a nearby frame from uxterm (alt+k s for vsplit): 

 $ xprop WM_CLASS

Then selecting my running browser, where it will spit out these important values = instance, class variables for use in Ion's winprop.

 WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Gecko", "Firefox-bin"

Then I made an ~/.xsession with:
 /usr/bin/mozilla-firefox &
 x-terminal-emulator -e screen &
 exec x-window-manager

I tried stuff ~/xinitrc(what about ~/.xclients ??), but it didn't work for some reason.

Now when I log in, firefox is loaded. I don't have to waste 10 seconds of my life everytime I log in!!

See my configs here: http://svn.natalian.org/home/.ion2/

Shortcuts refcard:
 alt+s split
 alt+k s vsplit
 alt+ left or right cursors pgup/pgdown between workspaces(WS)
 alt+tab toggle between frame in WS
