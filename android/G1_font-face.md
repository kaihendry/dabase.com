My [style sheet](http://dabase.com/local.css) loads the [Andika
font](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Andika).
Try this page in your Android browser!

## What is @font-face ??

It basically means you can dynamically use any font you want.

A big problem or blessing if you like sane type faces, is there is
only a few "Web fonts" that work everywhere.

However new technology exists where you just download them on the fly,
and Android supports this. So designers can rejoice that they can use
type faces they want. Without using horrible techniques like making
bitmap images of headings which can't work on mobiles as they can't
scale.
