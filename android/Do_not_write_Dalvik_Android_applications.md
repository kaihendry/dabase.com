# Do not write Dalvik Android applications

First I implore you **not** to write an [Android Application](http://code.google.com/android/). i.e. a [Java dalvik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_virtual_machine) .apk.

Most developers require
[Geolocation](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) and you can easily
achieve [Geolocation in the Android browser](http://geo.webvm.net/). The Web on
mobile is the future!

## Other reasons not to develop Dalvik applications

* <strike>Google's **Market has no upgrade** mechanism.</strike> The Web has painless **seamless** upgrades
by default. Why choose anything else than giving your users continuous
improvement everyday?
* The Web works on more devices and computers than Dalvik ever will -- the Web is device independent!
* The Android market allows you to market your application to several certain countries. Choose a Web application and your market is the world!
* Want to create bookmarks to your Web application from the homescreen? Use the [Gears shortcut](http://shortcut.dabase.com) mechanism! (disabled by Google in Cupcake)
* Choose from a larger pool of Web developers, to develop your idea for the mobile platform!
* Does the Web miss a critical device API for your application? Tell the [W3C](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/latest) about your requirements.
