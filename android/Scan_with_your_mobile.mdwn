Whilst passing through Waterloo station, I usually buy some fresh fruit juice
from the Marks&Spencers (M&S) store. This time I noticed my bottle had some
sort of 2d barcode on it.

I spent a few uncomfortable minutes trying and trying again to scan the code
with the "Barcode Scanner" application on my Android G1. Didn't work. :(

Later I [found out](http://2d-code.co.uk/marks-and-spencer-2d-code) that this a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_matrix_%28computer%29">Data Matrix
code</a> and not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code">QR code</a>.
ARGH!

Unsurprisingly 'Data Matrix' support is 'alpha' quality according to the [ZXing
library](http://code.google.com/p/zxing/) powering the Barcode application.

So being unable to read the code, I hoped M&S packaging would sensibly give a
short Web page URL for the same information. Urm, no they don't. Not even an
email address. It's gets worse, WAP worse.

In the small print it say **WAP enabled mobiles only**. Eh? Have I gone back in
time 10 years? To add insult to injury there is a link to the T&Cs:
<http://www.mands.mobi/ftg> a frickin' stupid
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DotMobi> address!

	Welcome to Your M&S

OMG. How piss poor. :(

You know I'd rather have them link to a M&S freshly squeezed Facebook page. That's less retarded.
