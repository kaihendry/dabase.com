# G1 Annoyances

1. SMS not being integrated to email. Basically I want to forward SMSes as email. Would be nice to have an email address that fowards to SMS.
* [Input type file](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#file-upload-state) is disabled/unimplemented
* Phone number in status not updated after number change
* 2G Internet does not work when you are using voice. URM!?
* Can't use G1 as a modem.
* Be good if it showed alarms on the clock face. The Alarm icon on the notification has no value after you've set a couple to manage you routine ...
* There must be a way of quickly informing Gtalk users you are on the mobile!!
* [Android Issue list](http://b.android.com)
* [Piss off the developer](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/08/android_dev_edition/)
* No Google **browser** [Roadmap](http://source.android.com/roadmap) [cupcake](http://source.android.com/roadmap/cupcake). Google develops Android browser stuff in private and then does an open code snapshot. If 3rd party businesses want to work with their platform, they need to know exactly when HTML5 features are going to be rolled out!
* No Android market for Web applications such as [Geo](http://geo.webvm.net)

Gtalk chats are a great feature. But often I miss the chat and I can't figure
out how the "Recent conversations archive" supposed to work. What's worse is
that sometimes I confuse 'Gtalk chat' with SMS, whereby SMS does not seem to
appear in 'Gtalk chat' pane of Gmail!
