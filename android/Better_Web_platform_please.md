# Use cases

Lets consider some use cases I want. :)

## Sharing a snap on Flickr then making a tweet about it.

It's really tiresome to quickly to a URL...

1. Go to URL
* _Long press_  on URL
* Copy

Be better if there was some API to copy to clipboard. Or just a better clipboard really.

## Having 100% reception, or rather... being able to tweet whilst not connected

Having no offline HTML5 support *sucks*! Gears theoretically should have
support for this, but Android Google Reader Web application does not use this
feature. WHY?

## A friend texts me from her new mobile number. How do I get that number from a SMS into my contact as a secondary number?

You should be able to **long press** to copy and paste to do this. It's a bit clumsy. When you have the number in the dial screen you can actually press 'Menu' and select "Add to contacts".

# Poor Web integration

You can thankfully add bookmarks to the home screen. Your Web application can
too with the [Gears shortcut
API](http://code.google.com/apis/gears/samples/hello_world_shortcuts/hello_world_shortcuts.html).
What would be better is [widget support](http://wiki.webvm.net/widgets/).

Once opening a bookmark from the homescreen, Android launches a new window in
Android Chrome Web browser. Unfortunately this really sucks as your can only
have 6 windows open at one time. Since default actions open a new window, it's
quite easy to hit this limit annoyingly again and again. The paradox is that
you are somehow allowed to keep many multiple Dalvik applications open in the
background, but not Web applications!!
