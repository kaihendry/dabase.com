Upgrading from a [[Nexus 1|Nexus_One]] was particularly painful since I had to
re-install all the apps. Furthermore the App metadata like where I am with
"Angry birds" is not carried over. So I've must have lost many several hours of
setup! :(

Network settings, Bookmarks, email accounts, all need to be re-setup. Under
Privacy settings there is "Back up my data" & "Automatic restore" option
ticked, but it didn't seem to work! Most definitely seems to be an opportunity
to sort out the Android upgrade path.

On first impression, the screen does look better than the Nexus 1. The battery
life seems just as bad as the Nexus 1. The lock and home keys are re-mapped,
which I'm getting used to. Tbh, I prefer the home key on the right, but it is
worrying how this small aspect is so fragmented already! Pick up an Android and
you will need to get used it's mappings. Pick up an Iphone and you're A for
away.

# Cons

* Slippery back. Place the mobile on my bed and it slips off!
* [Terrible battery life](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5326740066/), though the display is on a 30 second time out!
* Hard to tell when it's upside down when taking it out my pocket
* I have a little lip on my screen
* No Gtalk video enabled chat :( I want it, though this function [kills my laptop](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/20858521155272705), nevermind my mobile
* NFC reader consumes battery :/ Can't figure out the new Tags application even though a friend also have a Nexus S!

# Pros

* Lightweight
* NFC reader!
* It's what Google employees work with
* No mouse ball (less is more)
* The new vector drawn Maps is coool
* [VOIP capability](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5313161074/) is exciting
