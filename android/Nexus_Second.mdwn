Upgrading from a [[Nexus 1|Nexus_One]] was particularly painful since I had to
re-install all the apps. Furthermore the App metadata like where I am with
"Angry birds" is not carried over. So I've must have lost many several hours of
setup & game progression! :(

Network settings, Bookmarks, passwords, cookies, email accounts, all need to be
re-setup. Under Privacy settings there is "Back up my data" & "Automatic
restore" option ticked, but it didn't seem to work! Most definitely seems to be
an opportunity to sort out the Android upgrade path.

The Nexus S screen is much better than the Nexus 1, however the battery life
seems just as bad as the Nexus 1, if not worse. The lock and home keys are
re-mapped, which I'm getting used to. Tbh, I prefer the home key on the right,
but it is worrying how this small aspect is so fragmented already across
Android devices! Pick up an Android and you will need to get used it's
mappings. Pick up an Iphone and you're A for away.

# Cons

* Slippery back. Place the mobile on my bed and it slips off!
* [Terrible battery life](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5326740066/), though the display is on a 30 second time out!
* Hard to tell when it's upside down when taking it out my pocket
* I have a little lip on my screen
* No Gtalk video enabled chat :( I want it, though this function [kills my laptop](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/20858521155272705), nevermind my mobile
* NFC reader consumes battery :/ Can't figure out the new **Tags** application even though a friend also has a Nexus S!

# Pros

* Lightweight
* NFC reader!
* It's what Google employees work with
* No mouse ball (less is more)
* The new vector drawn Maps is coool
* [VOIP capability](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5313161074/) is exciting
