[UK consumers are frustratedly waiting for the
RC33](http://twitter.com/androidg1update) Android update. Featuring
[Latitude](http://google.com/latitude/) and voice search.

One can [manually
update](http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/02/05/how-to-get-rc33-on-your-g1-without-the-wait/),
though I am unsure if this [Google
update](https://android.clients.google.com/updates/signed-PLAT-RC33-from-RC30.f06aa9b3.zip)
is for the UK market.

Though, then again... WHY should there be a difference between UK & US updates?
I'm sure there isn't different Iphone software for different regions of the
world.

I lodged an email [complaint with
T-mobile](http://support.t-mobile.co.uk/help-and-support/index?page=html&cat=CONTACTUS)
and a  "tech" engineer from T-mobile called me, despite requesting T-mobile
**email me** instead.

He asked around and he says there is "no rollout in place" and he didn't know
what I was talking about with RC33 and Firmware 1.1.

Furthermore he told me he personally hacked his. Unbelievably he was actually
excitedly telling me I could downgrade to RC8 I mean... WTF is going on?

Do Google UK have a contact in T-mobile UK? **Talk to each other**. Give the
T-mobile engineers some information. They actually seem just as thirsty for
Android knowledge as I am.
