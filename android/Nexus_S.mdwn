Upgrading from a [[Nexus 1|Nexus_One]], I found it particularly painful that I
had to re-install all the apps. Furthermore the App metadata like where I am
with "Angry birds" is not carried over. So I've must have lost many several
hours of setup! :(

Network settings, Bookmarks, email accounts, all need to be re-setup. Under
Privacy settings there is "Back up my data" & "Automatic restore" option
ticked, but it didn't seem to work!

On first impression, the screen does look better than the Nexus 1. The battery
life seems just as bad as the Nexus 1.

# Cons

* Slippery back
* Terrible battery life, though the display is on a 30 second time out!
* Hard to tell it's upside down when taking it out my pocket
