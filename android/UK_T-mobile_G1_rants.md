# T-mobile customer service

The good thing is that you can just email `CustomerServices@t-mobile.co.uk` and
you'll more than likely receive a response. This beats Three.co.uk who
basically refused to answer queries by any medium other that voice. I assume
they do this to ensure they can not be held liable for any misinformation as it
is difficult to record voice.

The bad things are you'll get an autoresponder once sending the mail. And the
follow up will more than likely be an essay with bad news from a customer
service **'droid**.

Update: Lately they demand:

	So that I can answer your query, I'll need to access your account to confirm
	you're the account holder. To do this I need you to confirm your mobile number,
	full name and address including postcode and your password if you have one
	registered to the account.

Even for generic questions! Once I gave my number as the **Phone number** in
**Status** is incorrect. They rung me up instead of replying. I asked them
politely to please email me a response instead. This was resisted heavily and I
still have not heard from T-mobile customer service! PA-THE-TIC T-mobile. Oh I
have received a response now after emailing again:

	I've also checked your other query for you and I'm afraid there?s no work
	around to remove the number from your status menu. However this wont affect
	your phone.

## Things that suck with T-mobile

1. [No conference call](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/3006708296/)
* T-mobile employing [Content Transformation](http://www.w3.org/TR/ct-guidelines/), put **Header set Cache-Control: no-transform** in your `.htaccess`
* Call waiting does not seem to work
* Data reception at the University of Surrey SUCKS, even though they advertise on campus! WTF
* [No special treatment for T hotspots](http://static.natalian.org/2008-11-08/tmobile1.txt) -- "Sadly, there are no discounts for this service at present."
* [Your 250+ GBP allowance does not work abroad](http://static.natalian.org/2008-11-08/tmobile2.txt) - no special deals for Germany :(
