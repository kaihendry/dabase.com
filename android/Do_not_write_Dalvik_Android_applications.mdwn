# Do not write Dalvik Android applications

First I implore you not to write an [Android Application](http://code.google.com/android/). i.e. a [Java dalvik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_virtual_machine) .apk.

Most developers require Geolocation and you can easily achieve [Geolocation in
the Android browser](http://geo.webvm.net/). The Web is the future!

That been said, the best thing on the G1 is the comments on the Android market.
That's an incredibly hilarious Dalvik application that's brought tears to my
eyes!

## Other reasons not to develop Dalvik applications

* Google's **Market has no upgrade** mechanism. The Web has easy seamless upgrades
by default. Why choose anything else than giving your users continuous
improvement everyday?
* The Web works on more devices and computers than Dalvik ever will. Why limit your application's audience?
* Want to create bookmarks to your Web application from the homescreen? Use [Gears shortcut](http://code.google.com/apis/gears/samples/hello_world_shortcuts/hello_world_shortcuts.html) mechanism!
