11GBP for 5 days in Germany? I didn't use data nearly as much as I would in the
UK. Android has no data accountancy functionality. :(

A mobile phone that would detail accurate data roaming costs. Those are the
sensible sorts applications that provide tremendous value. Not stupid bar code
scanner applications.
