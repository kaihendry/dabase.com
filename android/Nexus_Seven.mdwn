So it's [[four_years|The_deprecated_SDcard]] since my last Android post. Ever
since I was given a "free" iPhone from my workplace Vodafone those years ago, I
decided to switch to IOS and I've been a happy camper ever since.

As people will testify who know me, I not an Android fan. Usability is poor and
I'm a Java hater. Nonetheless I've set myself a challenge to explore & develop
a Webconverger port. The source code won't be public, though I will make
efforts to document my efforts here.

I need Lollipop and I need a device. If my memory at Aplix serves me correctly,
running AVD emulator on my aging X220 would be madness.

So I bought a second hand Nexus 7 for 200SGD off <https://carousell.co/>.

First impressions of setting up the device is that the wireless "password" prompt is jarringly wrapped. UGLY!

It seems the device is unusable without logging into Google. Tbh I don't use
Gmail anymore and I don't want it to download my old email, nonetheless it went
ahead and did it. :( I'm logged into Youtube, but it seems like I need to
separately log into the Play store et al. What the hell!?

Not sure how I would ever use this device myself in my daily life. Ok, maybe
for watching Youtube videos in bed? :)

I've earmarked today to setup the [Android development environment on
Archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/android#Android_Studio). Bonus
points if I manage a Hello World app.
