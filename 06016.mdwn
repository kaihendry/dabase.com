A small unit test example I constructed from Mark Pilgrim's Roman test, however with that classic square. Can you think of something simpler?

Unit testing:

What it is testing:

Good docs:
http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/pyunit.html#USING

Methods needs to begin with test... to run as a unittest !!!!
